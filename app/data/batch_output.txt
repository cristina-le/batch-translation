[Narration]──The air stirred.
[Narration] The pale blue light that had been enveloping me until now receded.
[Narration] What I eventually saw was a grimy ceiling.
[Narration] My right arm, extended towards that place, was slightly different from my left arm, which was also extended.
[Narration] My right arm is made of exposed mechanical parts from the wrist down.
[Narration] My fingers move smoothly, but each time, a faint metallic scraping sound echoes.
[Narration] Next, I slowly raised my upper body.
[Narration] That's when I realized that the pale blue light I had been seeing was actually the gently curved, oval lid of something.
[Narration] It seems I was asleep inside this capsule-like thing.
[Narration] Where is this place?
[Narration] Who am I?
[Narration] Why am I here?
[Narration] Even when I ask myself these questions, I can't find the answers.
[Narration] Even when I try to trace back my memories, all I have is the memory of the pale blue light.
[Narration] In order to find a clue to my memories, I decided to get out of the capsule and walk around the room.
[Narration] Although I know the act of walking, the act itself feels unfamiliar, and my footing is unsteady.
[Narration] I paid attention not to fall, and slowly moved forward.
[Narration] The stagnant air was lukewarm, and every time I inhaled, dust clung to my throat.
[Narration] Light streamed in from a hole in the ceiling, revealing dust particles in the air along its path.
[Narration] It's likely that no one has entered this building for quite some time.
[Narration] A thin layer of dust spreads across the floor.
[Narration] What is this place used for?
[Narration] Countless oval capsules were scattered throughout the large room.
[Narration] Most of them are open.
[Narration] The insides are empty.
[Narration] Even if some are closed, there's nothing inside.
[Narration] It seems I'm the only one in this room.
[Narration] --No, that's not entirely accurate.
[Narration] There are people existing, leaning against the oval objects or lying on the floor.
[Narration] 
[Narration] But, that's not right.
[Narration] To be precise, those aren't people.
[Narration] It would be more accurate to call them humanoid objects.
[Narration] Those humanoid objects had mechanical parts peeking out from under their skin.
[Narration] Some had mechanical parts instead of a head.
[Narration] Others had exposed mechanical arms.
[Narration] Some had their lower bodies torn off, revealing the mechanical parts.
[Narration] And then I remembered what those humanoid objects were.
[Narration] Partners for humans, created for humans.
[Narration] Equipped with not only the five senses, but also emotions, they are the closest existence to humans.
[Narration] I reach out to a Philoid that has ceased functioning.
[Narration] The hand, with its exposed parts not covered by skin, closely resembled my right hand.
[Narration] This is a factory.
[Narration] I was created here.
[Narration] ......But the facility was likely abandoned for some reason just before completion.
[Narration] I stare at my mechanical right hand, not yet covered with artificial skin, and conclude the most likely possibility.
[Narration] Having understood my own existence, I started walking towards the wall.
[Narration] There was an old automatic door, and right next to it, an LCD panel displaying "CLOSE" was covered in dust.
[Narration] I touched it with my mechanical hand.
[Narration] The moment I felt something cold like electricity at my bloodless fingertips, it displayed "OPEN" and the door opened.
[Narration] Can I get outside from here?
[Narration] Is anyone left in this facility?
[Narration] I wanted to meet someone.
[Narration] I wanted to meet a human.
[I] Let's go find them, my partners.
[Narration] I pushed open the door leading outside.
[Narration] In order to prove my own existence.
[Narration] Returning home, I headed straight for the living room.
[Narration] There, a music box lay broken.
[Narration] I unraveled a book borrowed from the library, learning about its structure.
[Narration] Just as I thought, the gears inside were broken.
[Narration] That's why no matter how much I turned the handle, the disc wouldn't spin and no sound would come out.
[Narration] ...But what should I do about these gears?
[Narration] Would it be possible to make them according to the size specified in the book? No, it's impossible.
[Narration] With no answer in sight, I continued turning the pages of the book.
[Narration] At the end of the book, there was a list of products for each manufacturer, and a list of parts used.
[Narration] As I skimmed through it, my gaze caught on something.
[Narration] What I learned there was that the manufacturer of this music box also made clocks.
[Narration] If that's the case, then the precision parts might be the same as those used in clocks.
[Narration] Suddenly, I remembered what I had broken at Mad's shop.
[Narration] That clock... if they were going to throw it away because it was unusable...
[Narration] If I used the gears and other parts from the clock, I might be able to fix the music box.
[Shiona] "Ray, what are you doing?"
[Narration] At the same time as I saw the possibility of repair, Shiona came into the living room.
[I] "Shiona, listen. I might be able to fix the music box with the parts from the clock at Mad's shop."
[Shiona] "Really? Is that true?"
[Narration] Shiona had an even more joyful smile than usual.
[Narration] From that expression, I could understand Shiona's joy.
[Shiona] "But, don't push yourself too hard, okay? Even without the music box, I can still sing."
[Narration] Shiona picked up the music box and began to sing.
[Narration] That song she sang in the chapel.
[Narration] That somewhat nostalgic song.
[Narration] That song that warmed the depths of my heart.
[Narration] Seeing Shiona looking at the music box so lovingly, my resolve grew stronger.
[Narration] I want to fix this music box for her.
[Narration] And I want to make Shiona happy.
[Narration] That feeling swelled up inside me.
[I] "I'm going to go to Mad's shop again tomorrow."
[Narration] I'll try to ask if they can give me the clock somehow.
[Narration] But there was only one thing that worried me.
[Narration] The thing that worries me is that I broke that clock.
[Narration] I apologized, but it's still hard to go back there.
[Narration] The thought of Mad yelling at me again fills me with dread.
[Shiona] "You know, I want to make a lot of people smile with my brother's song."
[Narration] Shiona's words reached me as I hesitated.
[Shiona] "This song is orange... I'm sure it can turn many people's hearts orange. Because it's a song created with the wish for that to happen. Because that's my brother's wish. That's why I want many people to hear this song. And I want to make many people smile. That's my wish."
[Narration] Shiona said, as if to herself.
[Narration] Those words pushed me forward.
[Narration] I'll go to Mad's shop again tomorrow.
[Narration] And I'll apologize again for breaking the clock.
[Narration] Shiona's singing and the music box strengthened my resolve.
[Narration] The next day, I visited Mad's shop alone.
[Narration] I lost count of how many times I thought about turning back along the way.
[Narration] Each time I thought that, Shiona's smile would flash in my mind.
[Narration] I want to keep seeing that smile.
[Narration] That's why I want to fix the music box for her.
[Narration] I recalled my determination from yesterday many times.
[Narration] What I can do for Shiona.
[Narration] I steeled myself and stepped into Mad's shop.
[Mad] "You... what kind of face do you have to show here?"
[Narration] Immediately, Mad's voice, as low as distant thunder, poured down on me.
[Narration] I immediately wanted to run away, but I didn't.
[I] "I wanted to apologize more sincerely for yesterday."
[Mad] "About the clock? You already apologized for that."
[I] "Shiona was there then... I thought I should apologize properly, by myself."
[Mad] "I don't need that. Get out of here."
[I] "I can't do that. I'm truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday."
[Mad] "No matter how much you apologize, the clock is still broken. Get out."
[I] "I'm sorry. I'm really sorry."
[Narration] With my head bowed, I continued to apologize.
[Narration] I wonder how much time had passed.
[Narration] Eventually, Mad's slightly softer voice reached me.
[Mad] "...Raise your head."
[Narration] When I did as he said, Mad's face, looking somewhat exasperated, was there.
[Mad] "Jeez... what a guy. You're persistent beyond belief."
[I] "I'm sorry..."
[Mad] "Don't apologize anymore, I'll punch you!"
[Narration] He says that, but he doesn't seem as angry as he was yesterday.
[Narration] I thought I heard a small sigh.
[Mad] "You're done here, right? Get out of here."
[I] "Um... there's one thing I wanted to ask."
[Mad] "An ask? You've got some nerve asking me for something."
[Narration] The pressure makes my legs tremble, but Shiona's words push me forward.
[I] "That clock... could you let me have it?"
[Mad] "...Say that again."
[I] "Um... that clock from yesterday, could you let me have it--"
[Mad] "Are you kidding meeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!"
[Narration] The impact was like being struck by lightning, and I froze, standing perfectly still.
[Mad] "You broke it yourself and now you want me to give it to you? Don't get cocky!"
[Narration] It's no use....
[Narration] I can't take any more...
[Narration] Just as I was about to run away, a voice came from behind me.
[Shiona] "Please wait, Mad-san. Ray just wants to fix my brother's music box."
[Narration] There, standing before us, was Shiona, who should have been waiting at home.
[Narration] Shiona, without being intimidated by Mad-san, stepped between us.
[Shiona] "My brother's music box is broken, and Ray said he'd fix it for me. He just needs the parts for that. He's truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday. So, won't you please forgive him?"
[Narration] Shiona conveyed this to Mad-san with an unwavering smile.
[Mad] "Hmm... hmmm...."
[Narration] Mad-san's face, which had been bright red, gradually softened.
[Mad] "But, that clock's already gone. I threw that thing away. However..."
[Narration] Mad-san turned his back to us, but continued to move his mouth.
[Mad] "The abandoned factory on the edge of town, I threw it away there. I don't know what happened after that."
[Narration] After saying only that, Mad-san sat down, still facing the wall.
[I] "Thank you, Mad-san."
[Narration] Shiona bowed politely without losing her smile and left the shop.
[I] "Ah, thank you very much..."
[Narration] I bowed in the same way and left the shop.
[Shiona] "The abandoned factory is very close to where Ray was collapsed."
[Narration] Shiona told me as soon as we left the shop.
[I] "Is that the place Shiona goes to throw away the trash?"
[Shiona] "That's right. Trash gathers there from various places."
[I] "Could it be that you fix up things you pick up from there and sell them here?"
[Shiona] "Maybe. Mad-san often goes to that place."
[Narration] I see, that's why there were so many old things in the shop.
[Narration] He probably brings usable things from that place and reuses them.
[Narration] Anyway, I decided to head to that abandoned factory.
[I] "Shiona, if you don't mind, I'd like you to guide me to that place."
[Shiona] "I'm sorry, the Red Children are coming to my house today."
[Narration] She must be talking about those children who were talking to Shiona yesterday.
[Narration] Now that I think about it, we promised to treat them to soup.
[Shiona] "But Ray, you can't go alone, right? I'll go and cancel my promise with the children."
[I] "No, it's okay, Shiona. You should keep your promise."
[Shiona] "But, how are you going to get there?"
[I] "I'll try going to the library. I want to know more about this area, and I want to look at a map."
[Shiona] "The library..."
[Narration] Shiona's expression seemed to cloud over slightly.
[Shiona] "Eh... no, it's nothing... Hey Ray. Is Tippy-chan fond of Ray?"
[I] "I wonder. I don't think she dislikes me, but why do you ask?"
[Shiona] "Oh, it's nothing. If it's the library, I'm sure there's a map. Goodbye."
[I] "Yeah, I'll do that. Well then, see you later."
[Narration] I turned on my heel, intending to head to the library.
[Narration] At that moment, Shiona's smile seemed to hold a certain sadness, or so I thought.
[Narration] But I don't know the reason for it.
[Tippy] "Ray, you came."
[Narration] Tippy was in the same place as yesterday, shedding tears in the same way.
[I] "Yeah, I came. Hey Tippy, can I ask you something?"
[I] "Does this library have a map of the town?"
[Tippy] "Yeah, it does. It has lots of them."
[I] "That's great. Can you guide me to where the maps are?"
[Tippy] "I can... but..."
[Narration] Tippy was being somewhat hesitant.
[Tippy] "No, that's not it... that's not it, but..."
[Tippy] "Will you... hold me?"
[Narration] Tippy's face turned slightly red.
[Narration] Her sad expression hadn't changed, but her cheeks seemed a little softer.
[I] "...Hold you? Hold you like I did yesterday?"
[Tippy] "Yeah... is it no good?"
[I] "It's not no good. Here, come here."
[Tippy] "Yeah... yeah..."
[Narration] When I opened my arms, Tippy stood up and jumped into my chest, somewhat hesitantly.
[Narration] Unlike yesterday, I ended up holding her.
[Narration] However, my feelings were the same.
[Narration] The Tippy I held was still small, soft, and seemed like she would break.
[I] "Tippy, is this okay?"
[Tippy] "Yeah, it's okay. Ray... you're warm."
[Narration] Tippy rubbed her cheek against my chest.
[Narration] That gesture warmed the depths of my heart.
[Narration] Could this be the emotion called love?
[Narration] I want to protect this girl.
[Narration] I want to stop these tears.
[Narration] For a while, I continued to hold Tippy.
[Tippy] "Um, walk that way while holding me like this."
[Narration] Tippy, in my arms, pointed her finger towards the aisle.
[Narration] Still holding her, I headed in the direction she indicated with her finger.
[Tippy] "Why do you need a map?"
[I] "There seems to be an abandoned factory near the town. I want to go there."
[Tippy] "Why, to the abandoned factory?"
[I] "There might be a part I'm looking for there."
[Tippy] "The music box you were looking at yesterday?"
[I] "Yeah, that's right. I really want to fix Shiona's brother's music box."
[Tippy] "Shiona's... I see. I hope you find it."
[Narration] Still held in my arms, Tippy led me without hesitation to the bookshelf where the map books were kept.
[I] "Do you perhaps remember where each book is located?"
[Tippy] "Yeah, mostly."
[I] "That's amazing... Did someone teach you?"
[Tippy] "Nope. I learned by myself while waiting for my mom and dad."
[Narration] When she mentioned her mom and dad, Tippy's eyes became a little teary.
[I] "Um... is it this one?"
[Narration] To change the subject, I took out a map book.
[Narration] I sat down on the spot and opened the book.
[Narration] Like the music box book, this map was also handwritten.
[Narration] Could it be that all the books in this library are handwritten?
[Narration] If so, that's a considerable amount.
[Narration] Just who could have handwritten this many books?
[Narration] The task, requiring an endless amount of time, made me feel faint.
[I] "It's pretty beat up... How old is this book?"
[Tippy] "Um... I don't know. It's a book from way, way, waaaay back."
[Narration] It seemed like a map from decades ago.
[Narration] The buildings themselves seem to be the same as the current townscape, though...
[Narration] The pages were badly faded, as if tea had been spilled on them.
[Narration] Some pages were stuck together, and looked like they would tear if I tried to turn them.
[Narration] I carefully turned the pages.
[I] "Ah, could it be this one?"
[Narration] I found a factory symbol to the north of the town on the map.
[Narration] Considering the direction of Shiona's house, there's a high probability this is the place.
[Tippy] "Ray... are you going? Don't go..."
[Narration] Tippy clung to my neck.
[Narration] I stroked her small back with my hand, over and over.
[I] "It's okay, I'll come again."
[Tippy] "Really? Will you really come again?"
[I] "Yeah, of course. I promise."
[Tippy] "You will, okay? You absolutely, absolutely have to come again!"
[I] "Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely."
[Narration] Again and again, I made promises with Tippy.
[Narration] Why is that?
[Narration] Even so, I felt reluctant to leave.
[Narration] A feeling of wanting to stay by Tippy's side forever welled up inside me.
[Narration] Hiding that feeling, I left the library.
[Narration] Entering the abandoned factory, which I reached with the map, the smell of oxidized oil stung my nose.
[Narration] This factory probably used to make Philoid arms and legs as well.
[Narration] Parts for half-finished Philoid arms and legs were scattered everywhere.
[Narration] All of them were before being covered with artificial skin, with the mechanical parts exposed.
[Narration] Looking closely, I could see that they were made the same way as my right hand.
[Narration] Even knowing they were artificial, the sight was bizarre.
[Narration] To move an arm that was in the way, I pushed it aside with my right hand.
[Narration] The mournful sound of metal clashing against metal echoed through the factory.
[Narration] If something happens and any part of my body breaks, I'll come here.
[Narration] If it's here, there are mountains of replacement parts.
[Narration] In the back, there were many drums filled with oxidized oil.
[Narration] Most of it was oxidized, but some of the oil was still unopened.
[Narration] Even if I run out of oil, I can perform maintenance here without being seen.
[Narration] The further I went into the factory, the more the worries I had in the back of my mind were resolved.
[Narration] This abandoned factory should become an important place for me.
[Narration] But, I can't find the most important thing.
[Narration] That is, of course, the clock that Mad threw away in this place.
[Narration] But, inside this factory, there isn't even a clock, or anything that looks like trash.
[Narration] Could it be that the trash isn't inside the factory, but thrown outside?
[Narration] I left the factory for a moment and decided to go around its perimeter.
[Narration] Then, on the back side of the factory, I was able to find an area where machine parts were piled up high.
[Narration] There were machine parts, of course, but also a lot of trash dumped there.
[Narration] Surely this town's garbage dump must be here.
[Narration] Besides Mad, there must be others who take things that might be useful from here.
[Narration] I looked up at the mountain that was several times my height, and thought about that.
[I] "...Now then, where could it be?"
[Narration] There's a considerable amount of trash.
[Narration] It would be difficult to find it by searching steadily.
[Narration] But, there's no other way.
[Narration] I immediately decided to start searching from my feet.
[Narration] I don't know how much time passed.
[Narration] I had long since lost my sense of time.
[Narration] Because I was moving muddy metal plates and waste oil-covered containers, my hands were filthy.
[Narration] Oil was thickly stuck to my clothes, and before I knew it, there were a lot of stains.
[Narration] After that, I crossed a carpet of garbage, swam in a river of filth, and was hit by a waterfall of scrap.
[Narration] And then, I finally found it.
[Narration] It was in Mad's shop.
[Narration] The one I broke yesterday.
[Narration] That clock.
[Narration] I picked it up and stared intently at the hands on the dial.
[Narration] Naturally, it wasn't moving.
[Narration] I put it to my ear, but it didn't make any sound.
[Narration] It's only natural, since I was the one who broke it.
[Narration] This clock will probably never tick again.
[Narration] That fact pricked the depths of my heart.
[I] I gently embraced the clock and decided to head home.
[Narration] Shiona will greet me kindly.
[I] "I'm home. I found it."
[Narration] When I held out the oil-stained trophy, Shiona smiled gently.
[Shiona] "Really, thank you. Here, change your clothes, change your clothes."
[Narration] Shiona had prepared a towel and a change of clothes for me.
[I] After wiping off the dirt and changing, I headed to the living room.
[Narration] Shiona greeted me there as well.
[Shiona] "Ray, you look tired. Eat something and rest."
[Ray] "No, I'm okay. I want to get to work right away."
[Shiona] "Are you okay? I'm worried about your body, Ray."
[Ray] "I'm fine. Strangely, I don't feel tired right now."
[Shiona] "But, you have to eat something..."
[Ray] "Yeah, I know. I'll eat later, so you go ahead and eat first."
[Shiona] "...Okay, I understand. Good luck."
[Narration] Shiona leaves the living room.
[I] I watched her go, and then started working.
[Narration] I opened the book I borrowed from the library beside me.
[Narration] This music box has a mechanism where turning the handle causes various gears of different sizes inside to intricately mesh together, keeping the disc rotating at a constant speed.
[Narration] It doesn't seem that turning it faster makes the song faster.
[Narration] I thought that was a really amazing technology.
[Narration] Following the assembly instructions written in the book in reverse order, I disassembled the music box.
[Narration] Then, comparing the parts one by one, I found that a gear in the power transmission section was broken.
[Narration] So even with something that moves with such precision, it only takes one small part to fail for it to stop working.
[I] I couldn't help but look at my right hand.
[I] First, I'll try to find a gear from the clock that's the same size as this broken one.
[I] I then began disassembling the clock.
[Narration] I removed the lid and used a screwdriver to remove the screws.
[Narration] When I removed the cover, the inner structure was revealed.
[Narration] Gears much more precise than those in the music box meshed together in multiple layers.
[Narration] One of them, a slightly larger gear, had a broken axle. That's why the parts weren't turning.
[Narration] I must have broken this part yesterday.
[Narration] The fact that Mad threw this clock away means that there wasn't a part the same size as this gear.
[Narration] Fortunately, the broken gear wasn't the size needed for the music box.
[Narration] Disassembling things makes me feel uneasy somehow.
[Narration] Because I'm breaking this clock to fix the music box.
[Narration] Perhaps it's because I understand what kind of existence I am myself.
[Narration] Hesitating, but as a small offering, I disassembled the clock as carefully as possible.
[Narration] I lined up the clock gears on the table in order from smallest to largest, and compared them to those of the music box.
[I] "...Found it."
[Narration] I was able to find a gear that was almost exactly the same size.
[Narration] After that, all that's left is to transplant it into the music box according to the book.
[I] "I think this should work..."
[Narration] With this, the disc should move without any problems.
[Narration] I put the lid back on and turned the handle, and there was a response.
[Narration] But, the handle won't turn any further.
[Narration] I reread the book.
[Narration] The parts and the positions to install them are correct.
[Narration] Tilting my head, I removed the lid again.
[Narration] And then, I tried turning the handle as it was.
[Narration] Certainly, the gears meshed perfectly.
[Narration] But, because it hadn't been used for a while, the oil seemed to have completely dried up.
[Narration] That must be why the handle won't turn.
[Narration] What should I do?
[Narration] Should I go to Shiona and borrow some cooking oil?
[Narration] ...No, that's a problem too.
[Narration] Cooking oil and gear lubricant are probably different types of oil.
[Narration] It might work at first, but it could cause a breakdown.
[Narration] If that's the case, what should I do...?
[Narration] Suddenly, I looked at my right hand.
[Narration] Although it's covered by a glove, underneath are bare mechanical parts.
[I] I wonder if I could use the oil used in my hand.
[Narration] I took off my glove and looked closely at my right hand.
[Narration] Exposed mechanical parts.
[Narration] Oil is built inside to smoothly move those parts.
[Narration] I inserted a screwdriver into the palm near the base of my thumb.
[Narration] When I removed the exterior, it was packed with mechanisms for moving my mechanical hand, such as wiring, cylinders, and shafts.
[Narration] One of the cylinders inside contains oil.
[Narration] And it was detachable so that the old oil could be easily replaced.
[Narration] I removed the cylinder with my left hand, and dripped the oil that filled it onto the gears of the music box.
[Narration] I spread the oil with my fingertip so that it would blend into all the gears as much as possible.
[Narration] Will it work?
[Narration] I returned the cylinder to my right hand and reattached the exterior.
[Narration] Hiding my mechanical arm with the glove, I cautiously turned the handle.
[Narration] At first, it was awkward. But, as I turned the handle, the gears ran smoothly.
[Narration] The oil must have circulated through all the gears, the handle continued to turn without any snags.
[Narration] And that melody begins to play.
[Shiona] "Ray, that song...!"
[Narration] Shiona suddenly came into the room.
[I] "Yeah. I fixed it, Shiona."
[Shiona] "Thank you... thank you, Ray. Thank you... I'm so, so happy."
[Narration] Shiona showed a smile like never before.
[Narration] Just looking at that smile, the depths of my heart warmed up gently.
[Narration] And, I realized.
[Narration] Ah, so this is it.
[Narration] This is the emotion called happiness.
[Narration] I am happy now.
[Narration] I'm happy seeing Shiona's smile.
[Narration] And, for the first time, I was able to feel a sense of being useful.
[Shiona] "Thank you, Ray, thank you."
[Narration] Shiona took my hand and thanked me many times.
[Narration] As her face gets closer, I feel my face getting hot.
[Shiona] "Thanks to Ray's hard work, the music box is fixed. I can listen to that song again, which I had given up on. The orange-colored song that my brother made. My favorite song..."
[I] "Hey, Shiona, sing it for me. Let me hear your brother's song."
[Shiona] "Yes... of course!"
[Narration] I turn the handle of the music box.
[Narration] Shiona clasped her hands in front of her chest and began to sing along with the melody.
[Narration] The song she was singing when we met.
[Narration] The song Shiona's brother made.
[Narration] The orange-colored song.
[Narration] I feel like I understand its meaning now.
[Narration] The emotion dwelling in my heart is joy.
[Narration] Shiona's song.
[Narration] And Shiona, singing so happily.
[Narration] Just watching her, joy overflowed within me.
[Narration] More than usual, Shiona was singing that song so happily.
[Narration] That day, Shiona kept singing until she fell asleep.
[Narration] I was also absorbed in her singing voice and the tone of the music.
[Narration] Many times, Shiona asked me to play the song.
[Narration] Shiona kept singing until my arm wouldn't move anymore.
[Narration] Looking at her expression, I think.
[Narration] I want to be with Shiona like this forever.
[Narration] If Shiona wishes for it, I can be with her forever.
[Narration] But in order to do that, my true identity must never be revealed.
[Narration] Never, absolutely never...
[Narration] That day, I solidified my resolve to stay with Shiona forever.
[Narration] Night, the room darkened.
[Narration] On the two beds placed side by side, Shiona speaks to me.
[Shiona] "Will you listen to my request?"
[Shiona] "You see, I want many people to listen to this song. And I want to make them smile. I want to make many people happy with this song that my brother made."
[Narration] I only know the word itself.
[Narration] But, I didn't understand what it was.
[Narration] Is it a state of being?
[Narration] Or, is it an emotion?
[Narration] I repeat the word 'happiness' over and over in my head.
[Shiona] "So, I want you to help me."
[I] "Help? What should I do?"
[Shiona] "Tomorrow, I want you to go to the plaza with me. And I want you to turn the music box."
[I] "So, Shiona will sing, then."
[Shiona] "Yes, that's right. And I want as many people as possible to hear it. That orange-colored song that my brother made..."
[I] "Yeah, I want to do that too. Of course, I'll help."
[Narration] I heard the sound of the sheets rubbing together.
[I] "What's wrong, Shiona?"
[Shiona] "Hey, Ray... is it okay if I hold your hand?"
[Narration] I can't see Shiona's expression in the darkness.
[Narration] But I felt like Shiona's face was turning red.
[I] "Hand? With me?"
[Shiona] "Yes, I want to hold hands with Ray... is it no good...?"
[Narration] I search through my knowledge.
[Narration] I know the act of holding hands.
[Narration] But what does it mean for a boy and girl of a certain age...? 
[I] "No, it's okay..."
[Narration] If I am needed by a human... by Shiona, then I want to respond.
[Narration] Fortunately, she is on my left side.
[Narration] I think it will be okay if it's the hand covered with artificial skin.
[Narration] I reach out my hand to the bed next to me.
[Narration] In the cold room, my outstretched hand was a little chilly.
[Narration] I search for Shiona's hand in the air.
[Narration] Touching, warmth.
[Narration] Shiona's hand overlapped with mine.
[Shiona] "You're warm, Ray."
[Ray] "Yeah... you're warm too, Shiona."
[Narration] We held hands.
[Narration] Without either of us initiating, our fingers intertwined.
[Narration] Not just the warmth from our hands, but a different kind of warmth spread.
[Narration] Is this the warmth of a human, different from my artificial warmth...?
[Shiona] "Ray... tighter."
[Ray] "...Like this...?"
[Ray] "Sorry, did it hurt?"
[Shiona] "No... it was just stronger than I expected."
[Ray] "Is this strength okay?"
[Shiona] "Yeah... thank you, Ray."
[Narration] We held hands all night long.
[Narration] Until the morning woke us up, our hands remained connected.
[Narration] The next day, the plaza was filled with sounds.
[Narration] The melody that Shiona and I began to play.
[Narration] Shiona sings.
[Narration] I am turning Shiona's brother's music box.
[Narration] At first, there were no passersby.
[Narration] But as if drawn by Shiona's singing voice, the number increased.
[Narration] One person, then two, stopped, and soon a small circle formed.
[Narration] That circle quickly grew larger, and the deserted plaza quickly became bustling with activity.
[Narration] Everyone there is listening intently to Shiona's singing voice.
[Narration] A young couple snuggled close, holding each other's hands.
[Narration] An old man closed his eyes with deep emotion.
[Narration] A young man gazed at a woman a little distance away.
[Narration] A young parent and child laughed happily together.
[Narration] The children were moving their bodies to the rhythm of the song.
[Narration] Each person was listening to Shiona's song with their own thoughts and feelings.
[Narration] But there was one thing they all had in common.
[Narration] That was that everyone was 'smiling'.
[Narration] Everyone who listened to Shiona's song had a smile on their face.
[I] Right now, I feel warmth deep in my chest, feeling that I am helping to bring smiles to the faces of the people here.
[I] This is the emotion of happiness.
[I] The emotion I felt yesterday when I saw Shiona's smile.
[I] This is what it was.
[I] I am happy.
[I] I felt my cheeks lift slightly.
[I] Surely, I am smiling too.
[I] It might be a slightly awkward-looking smile.
[I] But that's okay.
[I] If I can get even a little closer to Shiona, I'll be satisfied with just that.
[Narration] The newly repaired music box continued to play the melody without a hitch.
[Narration] The handle I'm turning is also in good condition.
[Narration] The sound flowing from the disc resonates and amplifies within the wooden box, becoming a clear tone that goes outside.
[Narration] According to Shiona, it's an orange-colored melody.
[Narration] Shiona sings along to that melody.
