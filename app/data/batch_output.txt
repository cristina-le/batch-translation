The air shifted.
The pale blue light that had been enveloping me until now receded.
What I saw then was a grimy ceiling.
My right arm, which I extended towards that place, was slightly different from my left arm, which I also extended.
The part of my right arm from the wrist onward was made of exposed mechanical components.
My fingers moved smoothly, but each time, a faint metallic scraping sound echoed.
Then, I slowly raised my upper body.
That's when I understood that the pale blue light I had seen until just now was actually an oval lid with a gentle curve.
It seems I was asleep inside this capsule-like thing.
Where is this place?
Who am I?
Why am I here?
Even when I asked myself these questions, I couldn't find any answers.
Even when I tried to trace back my memories, all I had was the memory of the pale blue light.
In order to search for clues to my memories, I decided to get out of the capsule and wander around the room.
Even though I knew the act of walking, perhaps it had been a long time since I had done it, as my footing was unsteady.
I paid attention so as not to fall, and slowly moved forward.
The stagnant air was lukewarm, and each time I took it into my lungs, dust clung to my throat.
Light streamed in from a hole in the ceiling, revealing dust particles in the air along its path.
Probably, no one has entered this building for quite some time.
A thin layer of dust spread across the floor.
What kind of place is this?
Countless oval capsules were scattered throughout the large room.
Most of them were open.
Their contents were empty.
Even if some were closed, there was nothing inside.
It seems I'm the only one in this room.
…No, that's not exactly true.
There are people who exist, leaning against the oval objects or lying on the floor.
But, that's not right.
To be precise, those aren't people.
It would be more accurate to call them humanoid objects.
Those humanoid objects had mechanical components peeking out from under their skin.
Some had mechanical components from the neck up.
Some had exposed mechanical arms.
Some had their lower bodies torn off, revealing mechanical parts.
And then I remembered what those humanoid objects were.
Partners for humans, created for humans.
Equipped with not only the five senses but also emotions, they are the closest existence to humans.
I reach out my hand to a Philoid that has ceased functioning.
The hand with exposed, non-skin-covered parts looked very similar to my right hand.
This is a factory.
I was made here.
…It's just that, nearing completion, the facility must have been abandoned for some reason.
I stared at my mechanical right hand, before it was covered with artificial skin, and concluded the most likely possibility.
Having understood my own existence, I started walking towards the wall.
There was an old automatic door there, and right next to it, a liquid crystal panel displaying "CLOSE" was covered in dust.
I touched it with my mechanical hand.
The moment I felt something cold like electricity at my bloodless fingertips, it displayed "OPEN" and the door opened.
Can I get outside from here?
Is there anyone left in this facility?
I wanted to meet someone.
I wanted to meet a human.
Let's go find them, my partner.
I pushed open the door leading outside.
In order to prove my own existence.
When I returned home, I headed straight for the living room.
There, I found the broken music box.
I opened the book I had borrowed from the library and began to study its structure.
Just as I thought, the gears inside were chipped.
That's why no matter how much I turn the handle, the disc won't spin and no music will play.
…But, what should I do about this gear?
Would it be possible to make one to match the size written in the book? No, it's impossible.
With no answer in sight, I continued turning the pages of the book.
At the end of the book, there was a list of products for each manufacturer, and a list of parts used.
As I skimmed through it, my eyes caught on something.
What I understood there was that the manufacturer that made this music box also made clocks.
If that's the case, then the precise parts might be the same as those used in clocks.
Suddenly, I remembered what I had broken at Mad's shop.
That clock… if they were going to throw it away because it was unusable…
I might be able to fix the music box if I used the gears and other parts from the clock.
"Rei, what are you doing?"
At the same time as I saw the possibility of repair, Shiona came into the living room.
"Shiona, listen. I might be able to fix the music box with the parts from the clock that was at Mad's shop."
"Really? Is that true?"
Shiona had an even more joyful smile than usual.
From that expression, I could tell how happy Shiona was.
"But, don't push yourself too hard, okay? We can still sing even without the music box."
Shiona picked up the music box and began to sing.
That song, the one she sang in the chapel.
That song, a song that feels somehow nostalgic.
That song, a song that warms the depths of my heart.
Seeing Shiona gazing so lovingly at the music box, my resolve grows even stronger.
I want to fix this music box for her.
And I want Shiona to be happy.
That feeling swells up inside me.
"I'm going to go to Mad's shop again tomorrow."
I'll try asking if they can somehow let me have the clock.
But there was one thing that worried me.
That is, the fact that I broke that clock.
I apologized, but it still makes it hard to go there.
The thought of Mad-san yelling at me again fills me with dread.
"You know, I want to make a lot of people smile with this song, Onii-chan."
Shiona's words reached me, who was hesitating.
"This song is orange… I'm sure it can turn a lot of people's hearts orange. It's a song that was made with the wish for that to happen. Because that's Onii-chan's wish. So, I want a lot of people to hear this song. And I want to make a lot of people smile. That's my wish."
Shiona said, as if to herself.
Those words pushed me forward.
I'll go to Mad's shop again tomorrow.
And I'll apologize again for breaking the clock.
With Shiona's singing and the music box, I strengthened my resolve.
The next day, I visited Mad-san's shop alone.
I can't count how many times I thought about turning back along the way.
Each time I thought that, Shiona's smile would flash through my mind.
I want to keep seeing that smile.
And to do that, I want to fix the music box for her.
I recalled yesterday's resolution over and over again.
What I can do for Shiona.
I steeled myself and stepped into Mad-san's shop.
"You… what kind of face do you think you can show here?"
Immediately after, Mad-san's voice, as low as distant thunder, rained down on me.
I immediately wanted to run away, but I didn't.
"I wanted to apologize more sincerely for yesterday."
"About the clock? You already apologized for that, didn't you?"
"Shiona was there at the time… I thought I should apologize properly, by myself."
"I don't need that. Get out of here."
"I can't do that. I'm truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday."
"No matter how much you apologize, the clock is still broken. Go home."
"I'm sorry. I'm really sorry."
With my head bowed, I continued to apologize.
I wonder how much time had passed.
Eventually, Mad-san's voice, a little softer now, reached me.
"...Raise your head."
Doing as I was told, I saw Mad-san's face, looking somewhat exasperated.
"Jeez... what a guy. You're persistent beyond belief."
"I'm sorry..."
"Don't apologize anymore, or I'll punch you!"
He said that, but it didn't seem like he was as angry as he was yesterday.
I thought I heard him sigh softly.
"You're done here, right? Get out of here."
"Um... there's one thing I wanted to ask."
"An ask? You've got some nerve asking me for something."
The pressure made my legs want to give way, but Shiona's words pushed me forward.
"That clock... could you let me have it?"
"...Say that again."
"Um... that clock from yesterday, could you let me have it--"
"Are you kidding meeeeeeeeeee!?!"
The impact was like being struck by lightning, and I froze at attention.
"You broke it yourself and now you want me to give it to you? Don't get cocky!"
It's no use... .
I can't take any more than this...
As I tried to run away, a voice called out from behind.
"Please wait, Mad-san. Rei only wants to fix my brother's music box."
There stood Shiona, who should have been waiting at home.
Shiona, without being intimidated by Mad-san, stepped between him and me.
"My brother's music box is broken, and Rei said he'd fix it for me. He only needs the parts for that. He's truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday too. So, won't you please forgive him?"
Shiona, never losing her smile, conveyed that to Mad-san.
"Hmm... Hmmm..."
Mad-san's face was bright red, but his expression gradually softened.
"But, that clock isn't here anymore. I threw that kind of thing away. However..."
Mad-san turned his back to us, but continued to move his mouth.
"I threw it away at the abandoned factory on the edge of town. I don't know what happened to it after that."
After saying only that, Mad-san sat down, facing the wall.
"Mad-san, thank you very much."
Shiona bowed without losing her smile and left the shop.
"Ah, thank you very much..."
I bowed in the same way and left the shop.
"The abandoned factory is very close to where Rei collapsed."
As soon as we left the shop, Shiona told me.
"That's where Shiona goes to throw away the trash?"
"That's right. Trash from all sorts of places gathers there."
"Could it be that you fix up things you find there and sell them here?"
"That's right. Mad-san often goes to that place."
I see, that's why there were so many old things in the shop.
He probably brings usable things from that place and reuses them.
In any case, I decided to head to that abandoned factory.
"Shiona, if you don't mind, I'd like you to guide me to that place."
"I'm sorry, the Red Children are supposed to come to my house today."
She must be talking about those kids who were talking to Shiona yesterday.
Come to think of it, she promised to treat them to soup.
"But Rei, you can't go alone, right? I'll go tell the children I can't make it."
"No, it's okay, Shiona. You should keep your promise."
"But, how are you going to get there?"
"I'll try going to the library. I also want to know about this area and look at a map."
"The library..."
Shiona's expression seemed to cloud over slightly.
"Eh... no, it's nothing... Hey Rei, is Tippy-chan fond of you?"
"I wonder. I don't think she hates me, but why do you ask?"
"Oh, it's nothing. If it's the library, I'm sure there's a map. Goodbye."
"Yeah, I will. Well then, see you later."
I turned on my heel and started to head towards the library.
The smile Shiona showed at that moment seemed to hold a certain sadness, or so I thought.
But, I don't know the reason for it.
"Rei, you came,"
Tippy was in the same place as yesterday, shedding tears in the same way.
"Yeah, I came. Hey Tippy, can I ask you something?"
"Does this library have a map of the town?"
"Yeah, it does. It has lots of them."
"That's great. Could you guide me to where the maps are?"
"I don't mind... but..."
Tippy was somehow hesitant.
"No, that's not it... that's not it, but..."
"Will you hold me?"
Tippy's face turned slightly red.
Her sad expression hadn't changed, but her cheeks seemed a little softer.
"...Hold you? You mean, like I did yesterday?"
"Yeah... is it no good?"
"It's not no good. Here, come here."
"Yeah... yeah..."
When I opened my arms, Tippy stood up and jumped into my chest, somewhat hesitantly.
Unlike yesterday, I ended up holding her.
However, my thoughts are the same.
The Tippy I held was still small, soft, and seemed like she would break.
"Tippy, is this okay?"
"Yeah, it's okay. Rei... you're warm."
Tippy rubbed her cheek against my chest.
That gesture warmed the depths of my heart.
Could this be the emotion called love?
I want to protect this girl.
I want to stop these tears.
For a while, I held Tippy close.
"Um, walk that way while holding me."
Tippy pointed her fingertip towards the aisle from within my chest.
Still holding her, I headed in the direction she indicated.
"Why, do you need a map?"
"There seems to be an abandoned factory near the town. I want to go there."
"Why, to the abandoned factory?"
"The parts I'm looking for might be there."
"The music box you were looking at yesterday?"
"Yeah, that's right. I really want to fix Shiona's brother's music box."
"Shiona's... I see. I hope you find it."
Still being held by me, Tippy led me without hesitation to the bookshelf where the map books were kept.
"Could it be that you remember where all the books are?"
"Yeah, mostly."
"That's amazing... Did someone teach you?"
"Nope. I learned by myself while waiting for my mom and dad."
Upon mentioning her mom and dad, Tippy's eyes became a little teary.
"Um... is this it?"
To change the subject, I took out one of the map books.
I sat down on the spot and opened the book.
Just like the music box book, this map was also handwritten.
Could it be that all the books in this library are handwritten?
If that's the case, that's a considerable amount.
Just who could have handwritten this many books?
The task, which would require an endless amount of time, made me feel faint.
"It's pretty beat up... About how old is this book?"
"Um... I don't know. It's a really, really, reeeally old book."
It seemed like a map from decades ago.
The buildings themselves seem to be the same as the current townscape, though...
The pages were severely faded, as if tea had been spilled on them.
Some of them were stuck together and looked like they would tear if I turned them.
I carefully turned the page.
"Ah, could this be it?"
I found a factory map symbol to the north of the town.
Considering the direction of Shiona's house, there's a high possibility this is the place.
"Rei... are you going? Don't go..."
Tippy clung to my neck.
I stroked her small back with my hand, over and over.
"It's okay, I'll come back."
"Really? Will you really come back?"
"Yeah, of course. I promise."
"You promise? You absolutely, absolutely have to come back!"
"Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely."
I made the promise with Tippy again and again.
Why is that?
Even so, I felt reluctant to leave that place.
The feeling that I want to stay by Tippy's side forever is welling up inside me.
Hiding that feeling, I left the library.
Relying on the map, I entered the abandoned factory and was assaulted by the smell of oxidized oil.
This factory probably used to make Philoid arms and legs as well.
All around me, half-finished Philoid arm and leg parts were scattered everywhere.
All of them are from before being covered with artificial skin, with the machine parts exposed.
Looking closely, I can see that they're made the same way as my right arm.
Even knowing they're artificial, this sight is bizarre.
To move a rolling arm out of the way, I push it aside with my right hand.
The mournful sound of metal clashing against metal echoed throughout the factory.
If, by some chance, any part of my body breaks, I'll come here.
Here, there are mountains of replacement parts.
Deeper inside, there were many rolling drums filled with oxidized oil.
Most of it has oxidized, but there was also some unopened oil inside.
Even if I run out of oil, I can perform maintenance here out of sight.
The further I went into the factory, the more the worries I had in the back of my mind were resolved.
This abandoned factory should become an important place for me.
But, I can't find the most important thing.
That is, of course, the clock that Mad discarded in this place.
But, inside this factory, there isn't even a clock, let alone anything that looks like trash.
Could it be that the trash wasn't thrown inside the factory, but outside?
I decided to leave the factory for now and go around its perimeter.
Then, on the back side of the factory, I was able to find an area piled high with machine parts.
There were machine parts, of course, but also a lot of trash dumped there.
Surely this place has become the town's garbage dump.
Besides Mad, there must be others who have taken things that could be used from here.
Looking up at the mountain that was many times my height, I thought about that.
"...Now then, where could it be?"
There's a considerable amount of trash.
It would be difficult to find it by diligently searching.
But, there's no other way.
I immediately decided to start searching from my feet.
I don't know how much time passed.
I had long since lost my sense of time.
Because I was moving muddy metal plates and containers covered in waste oil, my hands were filthy.
My clothes were covered in oil, and before I knew it, there were a lot of stains on them.
Even after that, I crossed carpets of trash, swam through rivers of filth, and was battered by waterfalls of scrap.
And then, I finally found it.
It was in Mad's shop.
The one I broke yesterday.
That clock.
I picked it up and stared intently at the hands on the face.
Of course, it wasn't moving.
I put it to my ear, but it didn't make a sound.
It's only natural, since I broke it.
This clock will probably never tick again.
That fact pricked the depths of my heart slightly.
Gently, I hugged the clock and decided to start heading home.
Shiona will greet me kindly.
"I'm home. I found it."
When I held out the oil-stained trophy, Shiona smiled gently.
"Really, thank you. Here, change your clothes, change your clothes."
Shiona had prepared a towel and a change of clothes for me.
After wiping off the dirt and changing, I headed to the living room.
Shiona greeted me there as well.
"Rei, you look tired. Eat something and rest."
"No, I'm okay. I want to get to work right away."
"Are you okay? I'm worried about your body, Rei."
"I'm fine. For some reason, I don't feel tired right now."
"But, you have to eat..."
"Yeah, I know. I'll eat later, so you go ahead and eat first."
"...Okay, I understand. Good luck."
Shiona left the living room.
I watched her go, and then I started working.
I opened the book I borrowed from the library beside me.
This music box has a mechanism where gears of various sizes inside intricately mesh together when the handle is turned, keeping the disc rotating at a constant speed.
It seems that turning it faster doesn't necessarily make the song play faster.
I thought that was a very impressive technology.
Following the assembly instructions written in the book in reverse order, I disassemble the music box.
Then, as I compare the presence or absence of parts in order, I find that a gear in the power transmission section is broken.
So, even with something that moves with such precision, it only takes one small part to fail for it to stop working.
I couldn't help but look at my own right hand.
For now, I'll try to find a gear of the same size as this broken one from the clock.
I then began disassembling the clock.
I removed the lid and used a screwdriver to remove the screws.
When I removed the cover, the internal structure was revealed.
Gears much more precise than those in the music box meshed together in multiple layers.
One of them, a slightly larger gear, had a broken axle. That's why the parts won't turn.
I guess this is the place I broke yesterday.
The fact that Mad threw this clock away means that he didn't have anything the same size as this gear.
Fortunately, the broken gear wasn't the size needed for the music box.
Disassembling things makes me feel somewhat hesitant.
I'm breaking this clock to fix the music box, after all.
Perhaps it's because I understand for myself what kind of existence I am.
While hesitant, as a small offering, I disassembled the clock as carefully as possible.
I lined up the clock gears on the table, starting with the smallest, and compared them to the ones from the music box.
"...Found it."
I was able to find a gear that seemed to be almost the same size.
Now, all that's left is to transplant this into the music box according to the book.
"I think this should work..."
The disc should move without any problems now.
I put the lid back on and turned the handle, and I felt some resistance.
But the handle won't turn any further.
I wonder why.
I reread the book.
The parts and the positions where they're installed are correct.
Tilting my head, I removed the lid again.
And then, I tried turning the handle as it was.
The gears were certainly meshing perfectly.
But it seems the oil has completely dried up because it hasn't been used for a while.
That must be the reason why the handle won't turn.
What should I do?
Should I go ask Shiona to borrow some cooking oil?
...No, that's also a problem.
The type of oil used for cooking and the lubricant for gears are probably different.
It might move at first, but it could cause a breakdown.
Then, what should I do...?
Suddenly, I looked at my own right hand.
Although it's covered by a glove, underneath are exposed mechanical parts.
What about using the oil used in my hand?
I took off the glove and looked closely at my right hand.
Exposed mechanical components.
Oil is built inside to smoothly move those parts.
I inserted a screwdriver into the palm near the base of my thumb.
When I removed the exterior, it was packed with mechanisms such as wiring, cylinders, and shafts to move my mechanical hand.
One of the cylinders inside contains oil.
And it was detachable so that the old oil could be easily replaced.
I removed the cylinder with my left hand and dripped the oil that filled it onto the gears of the music box.
I spread the oil with my fingertip so that it would blend into all the gears as much as possible.
Will it work?
I returned the cylinder to my right hand and reattached the exterior.
Hiding my mechanical arm with the glove, I tentatively turned the handle.
Stiffly at first. But, as I turned the handle, the gears ran smoothly.
The oil must have circulated through all the gaps in the gears, and the handle continued to turn without any snag.
And then, that melody begins to play.
"Rei, that song...!"
Shiona suddenly came into the room.
"Yeah. I fixed it, Shiona."
"Thank you... thank you, Rei. Thank you... I'm so, so happy."
Shiona showed me a smile I had never seen before.
Just looking at that smile, the depths of my heart warmed gently.
And then, I realized.
Ah, so this is it.
This is the emotion called happiness.
I am happy now.
I am happy to see Shiona's smile.
And, for the first time, I was able to get a sense of being useful.
"Thank you, Rei, thank you."
Shiona took my hand and thanked me many times.
As her face drew closer, I felt my face getting hot.
"Thanks to Rei's hard work, the music box is fixed. I, who had given up, can hear that song again. This orange-colored song that my brother made. This song that I love so much..."
"Hey, Shiona, sing it. Let me hear it, your brother's song."
"Yes... of course!"
I turned the handle of the music box.
Shiona clasped her hands in front of her chest and began to sing along with the melody.
The song she was singing when we met.
A song Shiona's brother made.
An orange-colored song.
I feel like I understand its meaning now.
The emotion dwelling in my heart is joy.
Shiona's song.
And Shiona, singing so happily.
Just watching her, I was overflowing with joy.
More than usual, Shiona seemed so happy as she sang that song.
That day, Shiona kept singing until she fell asleep.
I was also absorbed in her singing voice and the melody.
Again and again, Shiona asked me to play the song.
Shiona kept singing until my arm could no longer move.
Looking at her expression, I think.
I want to be with Shiona like this, always.
If Shiona wishes for it, I can be with her forever.
But for that to happen, my true identity must never be revealed.
Never, absolutely never...
That day, I strengthened my resolve to stay with Shiona forever.
Night, the room darkened.
On the two beds placed side by side, Shiona speaks to me.
"Will you listen to my request?"
"You see, I want many people to hear this song. And I want to make them smile. I want to make many people happy with this song that my brother made."
I only know the word.
But I didn't know what it was.
Is it a state of being?
Or is it an emotion?
I repeated the word 'happiness' over and over in my head.
"So, I want you to help me."
"Help? What should I do?"
"Tomorrow, I want you to go to the plaza with me. And I want you to turn the music box."
"And then, Shiona will sing, right?"
"Yes, that's right. And I want as many people as possible to hear it. That orange-colored song that my brother made..."
"Yeah, I want to do that too. Of course, I'll help."
I heard the sound of the sheets rubbing together.
"What's wrong, Shiona?"
"Hey, Rei... can I hold your hand?"
I can't see Shiona's expression in the darkness.
But I felt like Shiona's face was turning red.
"Hand? With me?"
"Yeah, I want to hold hands with Rei... Is that... bad...?"
I searched through my knowledge banks.
I know the act of holding hands.
But what it means for a boy and girl of our age...
"No, it's okay..."
If I am needed by a human... by Shiona, then I want to respond.
Fortunately, she is on my left side.
If it's the hand covered with artificial skin, I think it'll be alright.
I reach my hand out to the bed next to me.
In the chilled room, my outstretched hand felt a little cold.
I search for Shiona's hand in the air.
Touching, warmth.
Shiona's hand overlapped with mine.
"You're warm, Rei."
"Yeah... you're warm, Shiona."
We held hands.
Without either of us saying anything, our fingers intertwined.
Not just warmth from our hands, but a different kind of warmth spread.
Is this the warmth of a human, different from my artificial warmth...?
"Rei... tighter, please."
"...Like this...?"
"Sorry, was that too tight?"
"No... it was just stronger than I expected."
"Is this strength okay?"
"Yeah... thank you, Rei."
We held hands all night long.
Until the morning woke us up, our hands remained intertwined.
The next day, the plaza was overflowing with sound.
The melody that Shiona and I began to play.
Shiona sang.
And I turned Shiona's brother's music box.
At first, there were no passersby at all.
But as if drawn in by Shiona's singing voice, their numbers increased.
One person, then two, stopped in their tracks, and soon a small circle formed.
That circle quickly grew larger, and the deserted plaza was soon bustling with activity.
Everyone there was absorbed in Shiona's singing voice.
A young couple leaned close, each holding the other's hand.
An old man closed his eyes with deep emotion.
A young man gazed at a woman standing a little ways away.
A young parent and child laughed together joyfully.
The children were moving their bodies to the rhythm of the song.
Each of them was listening to Shiona's song with their own thoughts.
But there was one thing they all had in common.
That was that everyone was 'smiling'.
Everyone who listened to Shiona's song was breaking into a smile.
Now, I felt a warmth deep in my chest, feeling that I was helping to bring smiles to the faces of the people in this place.
This is the emotion called happiness.
The emotion I felt yesterday when I saw Shiona's smile.
This is what it was.
I am happy.
I felt my cheeks lift slightly.
Surely, I am smiling too.
It might be a slightly awkward-looking smile.
But that's okay.
If I could get even a little closer to Shiona, I would be satisfied with just that.
The music box, which I had just repaired, continued to play the melody without a hitch.
The condition of the turning handle is also good.
The sound flowing from the disc reverberates and amplifies inside the wooden box, becoming a clear tone that goes outside.
According to Shiona, it's an orange-colored melody.
And Shiona sings along to that melody.
