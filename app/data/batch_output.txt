──The air shifted.
The pale blue light that had been enveloping me until now receded.
What I eventually saw was a grimy ceiling.
My right arm, which I extended toward that spot, was slightly different from my left arm, which I also extended.
My right arm was made of exposed mechanical parts from the wrist down.
My fingers moved smoothly, but each time, a faint metallic scraping sound echoed.
Next, I slowly raised my upper body.
That's when I realized that the source of the pale blue light that had been in my field of vision until just now was an oval-shaped lid with a gentle curve.
It seems I was asleep inside this capsule-like thing.
Where is this place?
Who am I?
Why am I here?
Even when I ask myself these questions, I can't find the answers.
Even when I try to trace back my memories, all I have is the memory of the pale blue light.
In order to find a clue to my memories, I decided to get out of the capsule and wander around the room.
Even though I know the act of walking, perhaps it has been a long time since I've done it, as my footing is unsteady.
I paid attention not to fall and slowly moved forward.
The drifting air was lukewarm, and each time I took air into my lungs, dust clung to my throat.
Light from outside streamed in through a hole in the ceiling, revealing dust particles in the air along its path.
It seems that no one has entered this building for quite some time.
A thin layer of dust spread across the floor.
What is this place used for, I wonder?
Countless oval capsules were scattered throughout the large room.
Most of them are open.
The insides are empty.
Even if some are closed, there's nothing inside.
It seems I'm the only one in this room.
──No, to be precise, that's not true.
There are people who exist, leaning against the oval objects or lying on the floor.
But, that's not right.
Those aren't exactly people, if I'm being accurate.
It would be more correct to call them humanoid objects.
Those humanoid objects had mechanical parts peeking out from under their skin.
Some had mechanical parts from the neck up.
Some had exposed mechanical arms.
Some had their lower bodies torn off, revealing mechanical parts.
And then, I remembered what those humanoid objects were.
Partners for humans, created for humans.
Equipped with not only the five senses but also emotions, they are the closest existence to humans.
I reach out my hand to a Philoid that has ceased functioning.
The hand with exposed parts not covered by skin looked very similar to my right hand.
This is a factory.
I was made here.
…But the facility was probably abandoned for some reason just before completion.
I stare at my mechanical right hand before it was covered with artificial skin, and conclude the most likely possibility.
Having understood my own existence, I started walking towards the wall.
There was an old automatic door there, and right next to it was an LCD panel displaying "CLOSE," covered in dust.
I tried touching it with my mechanical hand.
The moment I felt something cold like electricity at my bloodless fingertips, it displayed "OPEN" and the door opened.
Can I get outside from here, I wonder?
Is anyone left in this facility?
I wanted to meet someone.
I wanted to meet a human.
Let's go find them, my partner.
I pushed open the door leading to the outside.
In order to prove my own existence.
When I returned home, I headed straight for the living room.
There was a broken music box there.
I unraveled the book I borrowed from the library and learned about its structure.
As I thought, the gears inside were chipped.
That's why no matter how much I turn the handle, the disc won't spin and no sound will come out.
...But what should I do about these gears?
Would it be possible to make them to the size written in the book? No, it's impossible.
With no answer in sight, I continued turning the pages of the book.
At the end of the book, there was a list of products for each manufacturer, and a list of parts used.
As I skimmed through it, my eyes caught on something.
What I understood there was that the manufacturer that made this music box also made clocks.
If that's the case, then the precise parts might be the same as those used in clocks.
Suddenly, I remembered what I broke at Mad's shop.
That clock... if they're going to throw it away because it's unusable...
If I use the gears and other parts from the clock, I might be able to fix the music box.
"Rei, what are you doing?"
At the same time as I saw the possibility of repair, Shiona came into the living room.
"Shiona, listen. I might be able to fix the music box with the parts from the clock that was at Mad's shop."
"Really? Really?"
Shiona had an even more joyful smile than usual.
From that expression, I could tell how happy Shiona was.
"But don't push yourself too hard, okay? We can still sing even without the music box."
Shiona picked up the music box and started singing.
That song she sang in the chapel.
That song, somehow nostalgic.
That song, that warms the depths of my heart.
Looking at Shiona, who gazes at the music box with affection, my resolve grows stronger.
I want to fix this music box for her.
And I want to make Shiona happy.
That feeling swells up inside me.
"I'm going to Mad's shop again tomorrow."
I'll try to ask him if he can let me have the clock somehow.
But there was only one thing that worried me.
That is, I was the one who broke that clock.
I apologized, but it's still hard to go there.
I'm terrified of Mad yelling at me again.
"You know, I want to make a lot of people smile with this song, Rei."
Shiona's words reached me as I hesitated.
"This song is orange... I'm sure it can turn many people's hearts orange. Because it's a song made with the wish that it would. Because that's your wish, Rei. So, I want many people to hear this song. And I want to make many people smile. That's my wish."
Shiona said, as if talking to herself.
Those words pushed me forward.
I'll go to Mad's shop one more time tomorrow.
And I'll apologize again for breaking the clock.
With Shiona's singing and the music box, I strengthened my resolve.
The next day, I visited Mad's shop alone.
I can't count how many times I thought about turning back on the way.
Each time I thought that, Shiona's smile flashed through my mind.
I want to keep seeing that smile.
To do that, I want to fix the music box for her.
I recalled yesterday's resolve many times.
What I can do for Shiona.
I steeled myself and stepped into Mad's shop.
"You, what face do you have to show here?"
Immediately after, Mad's voice, as low as distant thunder, rained down.
I wanted to run away immediately, but I didn't.
"I wanted to apologize more sincerely for yesterday."
"About the clock? You already apologized for that."
"Shiona was there at the time... I thought I should apologize properly, by myself."
"I don't need that. Get out of here."
"I can't do that. I'm truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday."
"No matter how much you apologize, the clock is still broken, leave."
"I'm sorry. I'm really sorry."
With my head bowed, I continued to apologize.
I wonder how much time had passed.
Eventually, Mad's voice, a little softer, reached me.
"...Raise your head."
Doing as I was told, Mad's face, looking somewhat exasperated, was there.
"Jeez... what a guy. You're persistent beyond belief."
"I'm sorry..."
"Don't apologize anymore, or I'll punch you!"
He said that, but there didn't seem to be as much anger as yesterday.
I thought I heard a small sigh.
"You're done here, right? Get out of here."
"Um... there's just one thing I wanted to ask."
"A request? You've got some nerve asking me for a favor."
The pressure made my legs tremble, but Shiona's words pushed me forward.
"That clock... could you let me have it?"
"...Say that again."
"Um... that clock from yesterday, could you let me have it--"
"Are you kidding meeeeeeeeeee!!"
The impact was like being struck by lightning, and I froze at attention.
"You broke it yourself and now you want me to give it to you? Don't get cocky!"
This is no good... .
I can't take any more of this... .
As I tried to run away, a voice came from behind.
"Please wait, Mad. Rei just wants to fix my brother's music box."
Shiona, who should have been waiting at home, was there.
Shiona, without being intimidated by Mad, stepped between him and me.
"My brother's music box is broken, and Rei said he'd fix it for me. He just needs the parts for that. He's truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday. So, won't you please forgive him?"
Shiona told Mad with an unwavering smile.
"Hmm... hmmm..."
Mad's face was bright red, but his expression gradually softened.
"But, that clock is gone now. I threw that thing away. However..."
Mad turned his back to us, but continued to move his mouth.
"I threw it away at the abandoned factory on the outskirts of town. I don't know what happened after that."
After saying only that, Mad sat down facing the wall.
"Thank you, Mad."
Shiona bowed without losing her smile and left the store.
"Ah, thank you very much..."
I bowed in the same way and left the store.
"The abandoned factory is very close to where Rei collapsed."
As soon as we left the store, Shiona told me.
"Um, is that where Shiona goes to throw out the trash?"
"That's right. Trash from all sorts of places gathers there."
"Could it be that you fix up things you find there and sell them here?"
"That's right. Mad often goes to that place."
I see, that's why there were so many old things in the store.
He probably brings usable things from that place and reuses them.
In any case, I decided to head to that abandoned factory.
"Shiona, if you don't mind, I'd like you to guide me to that place."
"I'm sorry, the Red Children are coming to my house today."
She must be talking about those kids who were talking to Shiona yesterday.
Come to think of it, I promised to treat them to soup.
"But Rei, you can't go alone, right? I'll go and cancel my promise with the children."
"No, it's okay, Shiona. You should keep your promise."
"But, how will you get there?"
"I'll try going to the library. I want to know more about this area, and I want to look at a map."
"The library..."
Shiona's expression seemed to cloud over slightly.
"Eh... no, it's nothing... Hey, Rei. Is Tippy-chan fond of Rei?"
"I wonder. I don't think she hates me, but why do you ask?"
"Oh, it's nothing. If it's the library, I'm sure there's a map. Goodbye."
"Yeah, I will. Well then, see you later."
I turned on my heel and started to head to the library.
The smile I saw on Shiona's face at that moment seemed to hold some sadness.
But, I don't know the reason why.
"Rei, you came."
Tippy was in the same place as yesterday, shedding tears in the same way.
"Yeah, I came. Hey Tippy, can I ask you something?"
"Does this library have a map of the town?"
"Yeah, it does. Lots of them."
"That's good. Will you guide me to where the maps are?"
"I will, but... but..."
Tippy was somehow hesitant.
"No, that's not it... that's not it, but..."
"Will you... hold me?"
Tippy's face turned a little red.
Her sad expression hasn't changed, but her cheeks seem a little softer.
"...Hold you? You mean, like I did yesterday?"
"Yeah... is it no good?"
"It's not no good. Here, come here."
"Yeah... yeah..."
When I opened my arms, Tippy stood up and jumped into my chest, somewhat hesitantly.
Unlike yesterday, I ended up holding her.
However, my thoughts are the same.
The Tippy I held was still small, soft, and seemed like she would break.
"Tippy, is this okay?"
"Yeah, it's okay. Rei... you're warm."
Tippy nuzzled my chest.
That gesture warmed the depths of my heart.
Could this be the emotion called love?
I want to protect this girl.
I want to stop these tears.
For a while, I held Tippy close.
"Um, walk over there like this."
Tippy pointed her finger towards the aisle from within my arms.
Still holding her, I headed in the direction she indicated.
"Why do you need a map?"
"Apparently, there's an abandoned factory near the town. I want to go there."
"Why, to the abandoned factory?"
"Because, the parts I'm looking for might be there."
"The music box you were looking at yesterday?"
"Yeah, that's right. I really want to fix Shiona's brother's music box for her."
"Shiona's... I see. I hope you find it."
Still held in my arms, Tippy led me without hesitation to the bookshelf containing the map books.
"Could it be that you remember where each book is located?"
"Yeah, mostly."
"That's amazing... Did someone teach you?"
"Nope. I learned by myself while waiting for Papa and Mama."
Upon mentioning her Papa and Mama, Tippy's eyes became a little teary.
"Um... I wonder if it's this one."
To change the subject, I took out one of the map books.
I sat down on the spot and opened the book.
Like the music box book, this map was also handwritten.
Could it be that all the books in this library are handwritten?
If that's the case, that's a considerable amount.
Just who could have handwritten this many books?
The task would require an endless amount of time, making me feel faint.
"It's quite tattered... About how old is this book?"
"Um... I don't know. It's a really, really, reeeeally old book."
It seemed like a map from decades ago.
The buildings themselves seem to be the same as the current townscape, though...
The pages are severely faded, as if tea had been spilled on them.
Some were stuck together, and looked like they would tear if I turned them.
I carefully turned the pages.
"Ah, could this be it?"
I found a factory map symbol to the north of the town.
Judging from the direction of Shiona's house, there's a high probability this is the place.
"Rei... are you going? Don't go..."
Tippy clung to my neck.
I stroked her small back with my hand, over and over.
"It's okay, I'll come again."
"Really? Will you really come again?"
"Yeah, of course. I promise."
"You promise? You absolutely, absolutely have to come again!"
"Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely."
Again and again, I made promises with Tippy.
Why is that?
Even so, I hesitated to leave.
A feeling that I want to stay by Tippy's side forever is welling up inside me.
Hiding that feeling, I left the library.
Entering the abandoned factory, which I reached with the map, the smell of oxidized oil stung my nose.
This factory probably originally made Philoid arms and legs as well.
All around, unfinished Philoid arm and leg parts were scattered everywhere.
All of them are before being covered with artificial skin, with the machine parts exposed.
Looking closely, I can see that they're made the same way as my right hand.
Even knowing they're artificial, this sight was bizarre.
To move one of the arms that was lying around, I pushed it away with my right hand.
The mournful sound of metal clashing against metal echoed throughout the factory.
If, by some chance, any part of my body breaks, I can come here.
Here, there are mountains of replacement parts.
In the back, there were many drums filled with oxidized oil rolling around.
Most of it has oxidized, but some of the oil was still unopened.
Even if I run out of oil, I can perform maintenance here without being seen.
The further I went into the factory, the more the worries I had in the back of my mind were resolved.
This abandoned factory should become an important place for me.
But, I can't find the most important thing.
That is, of course, the watch that Mad discarded in this place.
But, inside this factory, there isn't even a trace of a watch, or anything that looks like trash.
Could it be that the trash wasn't thrown inside the factory, but outside?
I left the factory for a moment and decided to walk around its perimeter.
Then, on the back side of the factory, I found an area piled high with machine parts.
There were machine parts, of course, but also a lot of trash dumped there.
Surely this town's garbage dump must be here.
Besides Mad, there must be others who have taken things that could be useful from here.
Looking up at the mountain that was several times my height, I thought about that.
"...Now then, where could it be?"
There's a considerable amount of trash.
It would be difficult to find it by diligently searching.
But, there's no other way.
I decided to start searching from my feet right away.
I don't know how much time has passed.
I lost my sense of time a long time ago.
Because I was moving muddy metal plates and containers covered in waste oil, my hands were filthy.
My clothes were covered in oil, and before I knew it, there were a lot of stains on them.
Even after that, I crossed carpets of trash, swam in rivers of filth, and was battered by waterfalls of scrap.
And then, I finally found it.
It was in Mad's shop.
The one I broke yesterday.
That watch.
I picked it up and stared intently at the hands on the face.
Of course, it's not moving.
I put it to my ear, but it didn't make any sound.
It's only natural, since I broke it.
This watch will probably never tick again.
That fact pricked the depths of my heart slightly.
Gently, I hugged the watch and decided to start heading home.
Shiona will greet me kindly.
"I'm home. I found it."
When I held out the oil-stained trophy, Shiona smiled gently.
"Really, thank you. Here, change your clothes, change your clothes."
Shiona had prepared a towel and a change of clothes for me.
After wiping off the dirt and changing, I headed to the living room.
Shiona greeted me there as well.
"Ray, you must be tired? Eat and rest."
"No, I'm okay. I want to get to work right away."
"Are you okay? I'm worried about your body, Ray."
"I'm fine. Strangely, I don't feel tired right now."
"But, you have to eat..."
"Yeah, I know. I'll eat later, so you go ahead and eat first."
"...Okay, I understand. Good luck."
Shiona left the living room.
I watched her go, and then I started working.
I opened the book I borrowed from the library beside me.
This music box has a mechanism where gears of various sizes inside intricately mesh together when the handle is turned, keeping the disc rotating at a constant speed.
Apparently, it doesn't mean the song will speed up if you turn it faster.
I thought that was a pretty amazing technique.
Following the assembly instructions written in the book in reverse order, I disassembled the music box.
Then, as I compared the parts one by one to check if any were missing, I found that a gear in the power transmission section was broken.
So, even with something that moves with such precision, it only takes one small part to fail for it to stop working.
I couldn't help but look at my right hand.
For now, I'll try to find something the same size as this broken gear from the watch.
I then started disassembling the watch.
I removed the lid and used a screwdriver to remove the screws.
When I removed the cover, the internal structure was revealed.
Gears much more precise than those in the music box meshed together in multiple layers.
One of them, a slightly larger gear, had a broken axle. That's why the parts wouldn't turn.
This must be the place I broke yesterday.
The fact that Mad threw this watch away means he didn't have anything the same size as this gear.
Fortunately, the broken gear wasn't the size needed for the music box.
Disassembling things makes me feel somewhat reluctant.
Because I'm breaking this watch in order to fix the music box.
Perhaps it's because I understand what kind of existence I myself am.
Hesitantly, but as a small offering, I disassembled the watch as carefully as possible.
I lined up the watch gears on the table, starting with the smallest, and compared them to the ones from the music box.
"...Found it."
I was able to find a gear that seemed to be almost the same size.
Now, all that's left is to transplant this into the music box according to the book.
"I think this should work..."
With this, the disc should move without any problems.
I put the lid back on and turned the handle, and I felt some resistance.
But the handle won't turn any further.
I wonder why.
I reread the book.
The parts and the positions where they're installed are correct.
Tilting my head, I removed the lid again.
Then, I tried turning the handle as it was.
The gears were indeed meshing perfectly.
But it seems the oil has completely dried up, probably because it hasn't been used for a while.
That must be the reason why the handle won't turn.
What should I do?
Should I go to Shiona and borrow some cooking oil?
...No, that's a problem too.
Cooking oil and gear lubricant are probably different types of oil.
It might work at first, but it could cause a breakdown.
If that's the case, what should I do...?
Suddenly, I looked at my right hand.
Although it's covered by a glove, underneath are exposed mechanical parts.
What about using the oil used in my hand?
I took off my glove and looked closely at my right hand.
Exposed mechanical parts.
Oil is incorporated inside to smoothly move those parts.
I inserted a screwdriver into the palm of my hand, near the base of my thumb.
When I removed the exterior, I saw that the inside was packed with mechanisms such as wiring, cylinders, and shafts to move the mechanical hand.
One of the cylinders inside contained oil.
And it was detachable so that the old oil could be easily replaced.
I removed the cylinder with my left hand and dripped the oil that filled it onto the gears of the music box.
I spread the oil with my fingertip so that it would blend into all the gears as much as possible.
I wonder if it will work?
I returned the cylinder to my right hand and reattached the exterior.
I hid the mechanical arm with a glove, and then cautiously turned the handle.
At first, it was awkward. But as I turned the handle, the gears ran smoothly.
The oil must have circulated through all the gaps in the gears, because the handle continued to turn without any snags.
And that melody began to play.
"Rei, that song...!"
Shiona suddenly came into the room.
"Yeah. It's fixed, Shiona."
"Thank you... thank you, Rei. Thank you... I'm so, so happy."
Shiona showed me a smile I had never seen before.
Just looking at that smile, the depths of my heart warmed gently.
And then, I realized.
Ah, so this is it.
This is the emotion called happiness.
I am happy now.
I am happy to see Shiona's smile.
And, for the first time, I was able to feel a sense of accomplishment.
"Thank you, Rei, thank you."
Shiona took my hand and thanked me many times.
As her face drew closer, I felt my face grow hot.
"Thanks to Rei's hard work, the music box is fixed. I can listen to that song again, which I had given up on. This orange-colored song that my brother made. This song that I love so much..."
"Hey, Shiona, sing it. Let me hear your brother's song."
"Yes... of course!"
I turned the handle of the music box.
Shiona clasped her hands in front of her chest and began to sing along with the melody.
The song she was singing when we met.
A song Shiona's brother made.
An orange-colored song.
I feel like I understand its meaning now.
The emotion dwelling in my heart is joy.
Shiona's song.
And Shiona, singing so happily.
Just watching her, I was overflowing with joy.
More than usual, Shiona seemed so happy as she sang that song.
That day, Shiona kept singing until she fell asleep.
I was also absorbed in her singing voice and the tone of the music.
Many, many times, Shiona asked me to play the song.
Until my arm could no longer move, Shiona kept singing.
Looking at her expression, I think.
I want to be with Shiona like this forever.
If Shiona wishes for it, I can be with her forever.
But for that to happen, my true identity must never be revealed.
Never, absolutely never...
That day, I strengthened my resolve to stay with Shiona forever.
Night, the room darkened.
On the two beds placed side by side, Shiona speaks to me.
"Will you listen to my request?"
"You see, I want many people to listen to this song. And I want to make them smile. I want to make many people happy with this song that my brother made."
I only know the word.
But I didn't know what it was.
Is it a state of being?
Or is it an emotion?
I repeat the word 'happiness' over and over in my head.
"So, I want you to help me."
"Help? How should I do it?"
"Tomorrow, I want you to go to the plaza with me. And I want you to play the music box."
"And then, Shiona will sing, right?"
"Yes, that's right. And I want as many people as possible to listen. To that orange-colored song that my brother made..."
"Yeah, I want to do that too. Of course, I'll help."
I heard the sound of the sheets rubbing together.
"What's wrong, Shiona?"
"Hey, Rei... can I hold your hand?"
I can't see Shiona's expression in the darkness.
But I felt like Shiona's face was turning red.
"Hand? With me?"
"Yeah, I want to hold hands with Rei... Is that... no good...?"
I search through my knowledge.
I know the act of holding hands.
But what it means for a boy and girl of our age...
"No, it's okay..."
If I'm needed by a human... by Shiona, then I want to respond.
Fortunately, she's on my left side.
If it's the hand covered in artificial skin, I don't think there will be a problem.
I reach my hand out to the bed next to me.
In the cold room, my outstretched hand felt a little chilly.
I search for Shiona's hand in the air.
Touching, warmth.
Shiona's hand overlapped mine.
"You're warm, Rei."
"Yeah... you're warm, Shiona."
We held hands.
Without either of us saying anything, we intertwined our fingers.
A warmth spread, not just from the warmth emitted from our hands.
Is this the warmth of a human, different from my artificial warmth...?
"Rei... tighter, please."
"...Like this...?"
"Sorry, was that too tight?"
"No... it was just stronger than I expected."
"Is this strength okay?"
"Yeah... thank you, Rei."
We held hands all night long.
Until the morning woke us up, our hands remained connected.
The next day, the plaza was filled with sounds.
The melody that Shiona and I began to play.
Shiona sings.
I'm winding up Shiona's older brother's music box.
At first, there was no one around.
But as if drawn in by Shiona's singing voice, the number of people increased.
One person, then two, stopped in their tracks, and soon a small circle formed.
That circle quickly grew larger, and the deserted plaza was soon bustling with activity.
Everyone there was listening intently to Shiona's singing voice.
A young couple snuggled close, each holding the other's hand.
An old man closed his eyes with deep emotion.
A young man gazed at a woman standing a little ways away.
A young parent and child laughed joyfully together.
The children were moving their bodies to the rhythm of the song.
Each and every one of them was listening to Shiona's song with their own thoughts.
But there was one thing they all had in common.
And that was that everyone was 'smiling'.
Everyone was smiling as they listened to Shiona's song.
I felt a warmth deep in my chest as I felt that I was helping to bring a smile to the faces of the people in this place.
This is what the emotion of happiness is.
The emotion I felt yesterday when I saw Shiona's smile.
This is what it was.
I'm happy.
I felt my cheeks lift slightly.
I'm sure I'm smiling too.
It might be a slightly awkward-looking smile.
But that's okay.
If I can get even a little closer to Shiona, I'll be satisfied with just that.
The music box, which I had just repaired, continued to play the melody without a hitch.
The handle I'm turning is in good condition too.
The sound flowing from the disc reverberates and amplifies inside the wooden box, emerging as a clear tone.
According to Shiona, an orange-colored melody.
Shiona sings along to that melody.
