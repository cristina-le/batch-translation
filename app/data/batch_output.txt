──The air shifted.
The pale blue light that had been enveloping me until now receded.
What I eventually saw was a grimy ceiling.
My right arm, which I extended towards that spot, was slightly different from my left arm, which I was also extending.
My right arm was made of exposed mechanical parts from the wrist down.
My fingers moved smoothly, but each time, a faint metallic scraping sound echoed.
Next, I slowly raised my upper body.
That's when I understood that the pale blue light I had seen until now was actually an oval-shaped lid with a gentle curve.
It seems I was asleep inside this capsule-like thing.
Where is this place?
Who am I?
Why am I here?
Even when I asked myself these questions, I couldn't find the answers.
Even when I tried to trace back my memories, all I had was the memory of the pale blue light.
To search for clues to my memories, I decided to get out of the capsule and wander around the room.
Even though I knew the act of walking, perhaps it had been a long time since I had done it, as my footing was unsteady.
I paid attention not to fall as I slowly moved forward.
The drifting air was lukewarm, and each time I took air into my lungs, dust clung to my throat.
Light streamed in from a hole in the ceiling, revealing dust particles in the air along its path.
Perhaps no one has entered this building for quite some time.
A thin layer of dust spreads across the floor.
What kind of place is this?
Countless oval capsules were scattered throughout the large room.
Most of them are open.
The insides are empty.
Even if there are some that are closed, there's nothing inside.
It seems that I'm the only one in this room.
…No, that's not quite accurate.
There are figures leaning against the oval objects or lying on the floor.
But, no, that's not right.
To be precise, those aren't people.
It would be more accurate to call them humanoid objects.
Those humanoid objects had mechanical parts peeking out from under their skin.
Some had mechanical parts from the neck up.
Some had exposed mechanical arms.
Some had their lower bodies torn off, revealing mechanical parts.
And then, I remembered what those humanoid objects were.
Partners for humans, created for humans.
Equipped with the five senses, of course, and even emotions, they are the closest existence to humans.
I reach out my hand to a Philoid that has ceased functioning.
The hand, with its exposed parts not covered by skin, closely resembled my right hand.
This is a factory.
I was created here.
…It seems the facility was abandoned for some reason just before completion.
I stared at my mechanical right hand, before it was covered with artificial skin, and concluded the most likely possibility.
Having understood my own existence, I started walking towards the wall.
There was an old automatic door there, and right next to it, a liquid crystal panel displaying 《CLOSE》 was covered in dust.
I touched it with my mechanical hand.
The moment I felt something cold like electricity at my bloodless fingertips, it displayed 《OPEN》 and the door opened.
Can I get outside from here?
Is there anyone left in this facility?
I wanted to meet someone.
I wanted to meet a human.
Let's go find them, my partners.
I pushed open the door leading outside.
In order to prove my own existence.
When I returned home, I headed straight for the living room.
There, I found the music box, still broken.
I opened a book I had borrowed from the library and studied its structure.
Just as I thought, the gears inside were chipped.
That's why no matter how much I turn the handle, the disc won't spin and no sound will come out.
…But, what should I do about these gears?
Would it be possible to make them according to the sizes written in the book? No, it's impossible.
With no answer in sight, I continued turning the pages of the book.
At the end of the book, there was a list of products from each manufacturer, as well as a list of parts used.
As I skimmed through it, my gaze caught on something.
What I understood there was that the manufacturer who made this music box also made clocks.
If that's the case, then the precise parts might be the same as those used in clocks.
Suddenly, I remembered what I had broken at Mad's shop.
That clock… if they were going to throw it away because it was unusable…
I might be able to fix the music box if I used the gears and other parts from the clock.
"Rei, what are you doing?"
At the same time as I saw the possibility of repair, Shiona came into the living room.
"Shiona, listen. I might be able to fix the music box with the parts from the clock that was at Mad's shop."
"Really? Is that true?"
Shiona had an even more joyful smile than usual.
From that expression, I could tell how happy Shiona was.
"But, don't push yourself too hard. We can still sing even without the music box."
Shiona picked up the music box and began to sing.
That song, the one she sang in the chapel.
That song, a song that feels somehow nostalgic.
That song, a song that warms the depths of my heart.
Seeing Shiona gaze at the music box so lovingly, my resolve grows stronger.
I want to fix this music box for her.
And I want Shiona to be happy.
That feeling swells up inside me.
"I'm going to Mad's shop again tomorrow."
I'll try asking if they can somehow let me have the clock.
But there was one thing that worried me.
That is, the fact that I was the one who broke that clock.
I apologized, but it's still hard to go there.
The thought of Mad yelling at me again fills me with dread.
"You know, I want to make a lot of people smile with this song, Rei."
Shiona's words reached me as I hesitated.
"This song is orange... I'm sure it can turn many people's hearts orange. It's a song created with the wish for that to happen, because that's Rei's wish. So, I want many people to hear this song. And I want to make many people smile. That's my wish."
Shiona said, as if talking to herself.
Those words pushed me forward.
I'll go to Mad's shop again tomorrow.
And I'll apologize again for breaking the clock.
With Shiona's singing and the music box in mind, I strengthened my resolve.
The next day, I visited Mad's shop alone.
I can't count how many times I thought about turning back on the way.
Each time I did, Shiona's smile flashed through my mind.
I want to keep seeing that smile forever.
That's why I want to fix the music box for her.
I recalled yesterday's resolve over and over again.
What I can do for Shiona.
I steeled my resolve and stepped into Mad's shop.
"You, what kind of face do you have coming here?"
Immediately after, Mad's voice, as low as distant thunder, rained down.
I immediately wanted to run away, but I didn't.
"I wanted to apologize more sincerely for yesterday."
"About the clock? You already apologized for that."
"Shiona was there at the time... I thought I should properly apologize by myself."
"I don't need that. Get out of here."
"I can't do that. I'm truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday."
"No matter how much you apologize, the clock is still broken, leave."
"I'm sorry. I'm really sorry."
With my head bowed, I continued to apologize.
I wonder how much time has passed.
Eventually, Mad's voice, a little softer now, reached me.
"...Raise your head."
As I did as he said, Mad's face, looking somewhat exasperated, was there.
"Jeez... what a guy. You're persistent beyond belief."
"I'm sorry..."
"Don't apologize anymore, or I'll punch you!"
He said that, but there didn't seem to be as much anger there as yesterday.
I thought I heard a small sigh.
"You're done here, right? Get out of here."
"Um... there's one thing I wanted to ask."
"An ask? You've got some nerve asking me for something."
The pressure made my legs want to give way, but Shiona's words pushed me forward.
"That clock... could you let me have it?"
"...Say that again."
"Um... that clock from yesterday, could you let me have it--"
"Are you kidding meeeeeeeeeeeeee!?!"
The impact was like being struck by lightning, and I froze at attention.
"You broke it yourself and now you want me to give it to you? Don't get cocky!"
It's no use... .
I can't take any more than this...
As I tried to run away, a voice rang out from behind me.
"Please wait, Mad-san. Rei just wants to fix my brother's music box."
There, standing before us, was Shiona, who should have been waiting at home.
Without being intimidated by Mad-san, Shiona stepped between him and me.
"My brother's music box is broken, and Rei said he'd fix it for me. He just needs the parts for that. He's truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday too. So, won't you please forgive him?"
Shiona never stopped smiling as she conveyed this to Mad-san.
"Hmm... Hmmm..."
Mad-san's face was bright red, but his expression gradually softened.
"But, that clock isn't here anymore. I threw that thing away. However..."
Mad-san turned his back to us, but continued to speak.
"I threw it away at the abandoned factory on the outskirts of town. I don't know what happened to it after that."
After saying only that, Mad-san sat down facing the wall.
"Mad-san, thank you very much."
Shiona bowed without losing her smile and left the shop.
"Ah, thank you very much..."
I bowed in the same way and left the shop.
"The abandoned factory is very close to where Rei collapsed."
Shiona told me as soon as we left the shop.
"That's the place Shiona goes to throw away trash?"
"That's right. Trash from all sorts of places gathers there."
"Could it be that you fix up things you find there and sell them here?"
"That's right. Mad-san often goes to that place."
I see, that's why there were so many old things in the shop.
He probably brings usable things from that place and reuses them.
In any case, I decided to head to that abandoned factory.
"Shiona, if you don't mind, I'd like you to guide me to that place."
"I'm sorry, the Red Children are coming to my house today."
She must be talking about those kids who were talking to Shiona yesterday.
Come to think of it, she promised to treat them to soup.
"But Rei, you can't go alone, right? I'll go tell the children I can't make it,"
"No, it's okay, Shiona. You should keep your promise to them."
"But, how are you going to get there?"
"I'll try going to the library. I want to know more about this area, and I want to look at a map."
"The library..."
Shiona's expression seemed to cloud over slightly.
"Eh... no, it's nothing... Hey, Rei. Is Tippy-chan fond of Rei?"
"I wonder. I don't think I'm disliked, but why do you ask?"
"Oh, it's nothing. If it's the library, I'm sure there's a map. See you later."
"Yeah, I will. Well then, I'll see you later."
I turned on my heel and started to head towards the library.
The smile Shiona showed at that moment seemed to hold a hint of sadness, I thought.
But, I don't know the reason for it.
"Rei, you came."
Tippy was in the same place as yesterday, shedding tears in the same way.
"Yeah, I came. Hey Tippy, can I ask you something?"
"Does this library have a map of the town?"
"Yeah, it does. It has lots of them."
"That's great. Will you guide me to where the maps are?"
"I want to... but..."
Tippy was somehow hesitant.
"No, that's not it... that's not it, but..."
"Will you hold me?"
Tippy's face turned a little red.
Her sad expression hadn't changed, but her cheeks seemed to soften just a little.
"...Hold you? You mean hold you, like we did yesterday?"
"Yeah... is it no good?"
"It's not no good. Here, come here."
"Yeah... yeah..."
When I opened my arms, Tippy stood up and jumped into my chest, somewhat hesitantly.
Unlike yesterday, it's a position where I'm holding her.
But, what I'm thinking is the same.
The Tippy I held was still small, soft, and seemed like she would break.
"Tippy, is this okay?"
"Yeah, it's okay. Rei... you're warm."
Tippy rubbed her cheek against my chest.
That gesture warmed the depths of my heart.
Could this be the emotion called love?
I want to protect this girl.
I want to stop these tears.
For a while, I held Tippy close.
"Um, walk that way while holding me like this."
From within my arms, Tippy pointed her finger towards the aisle.
Still holding her, I headed in the direction she indicated.
"Why do you need a map?"
"Apparently, there's an abandoned factory near the town. I want to go there."
"Why, to the abandoned factory?"
"Because, the parts I'm looking for might be there."
"The music box you were looking at yesterday?"
"Yeah, that's right. I really want to fix Shiona's brother's music box."
"Shiona's... I see. I hope you find it."
Still being held by me, Tippy led me without hesitation to the bookshelf where the map books were kept.
"Could it be that you remember where each book is located?"
"Yeah, mostly."
"That's amazing... Did someone teach you?"
"Nope. While waiting for my mommy and daddy, all by myself."
Upon mentioning the words "mommy and daddy," Tippy's eyes became a little teary.
"Um... is it this one?"
To change the subject, I took out a map book.
I sat down on the spot and opened the book.
Like the music box book, this map was also handwritten.
Could it be that all the books in this library are handwritten?
If that's the case, that's a considerable amount.
Just who could have handwritten this many books?
The task, which would require an endless amount of time, made my head spin.
"It's pretty beat up... About how old is this book?"
"Um... I don't know. It's a really, really, reeeally old book."
It seemed like a map from decades ago.
The buildings themselves seem to be the same as the current townscape, though...
The pages were severely faded, as if tea had been spilled on them.
Some were stuck together, and looked like they would tear if I turned them.
I carefully turned the page.
"Ah, could this be it?"
I found a factory map symbol to the north of the town.
Considering the direction of Shiona's house, there's a high possibility that this is the place.
"Rei... are you going? Don't go..."
Tippy clung to my neck.
I stroked her small back with my hand, over and over.
"It's okay, I'll come again."
"Really? Will you really come again?"
"Yeah, of course. I promise."
"You promise? You absolutely, absolutely have to come again!"
"Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely."
Again and again, I made promises with Tippy.
I wonder why.
Even so, I hesitated to leave that place.
A feeling that I want to stay by Tippy's side forever is welling up inside me.
Hiding that feeling, I left the library.
Entering the abandoned factory that I reached with the map, the smell of oxidized oil stung my nose.
This factory must have originally made Philoid arms and legs as well.
All around, half-finished Philoid arm and leg parts were scattered everywhere.
All of them are from before being covered with artificial skin, with the machine parts exposed.
Looking closely, I can see that they are made the same way as my right arm.
Even knowing they are artificial, this sight was bizarre.
To move a rolling arm out of the way, I pushed it aside with my right hand.
The mournful sound of metal clashing against metal echoed throughout the factory.
If, by some chance, something on my body breaks, I'll come here.
If I come here, there are mountains of replacement parts.
In the back, there were many rolling drums filled with oxidized oil.
Most of it has oxidized, but some of the oil was still unopened.
Even if I run out of oil, I can perform maintenance here without being seen.
The further I went into the factory, the more the worries I had in the back of my mind were resolved.
This abandoned factory should become an important place for me.
But, the most important thing can't be found.
That is, of course, the watch that Mad discarded in this place.
But, inside this factory, there isn't anything that looks like trash, let alone a watch.
Could it be that the trash isn't inside the factory, but thrown outside?
I decided to leave the factory for now and go around its perimeter.
Then, on the back side of the factory, I was able to find an area piled high with machine parts.
There were machine parts, of course, but also a lot of trash was dumped there.
Surely this town's garbage dump must be here.
Besides Mad, there must be others who have taken things that could be used from here.
Looking up at the mountain that was several times my height, I thought about that.
"...Now then, where could it be?"
There's a considerable amount of trash.
It would be difficult to find it by searching steadily.
But, there's no other way.
I immediately decided to start searching from my feet.
I don't know how much time passed.
I had long since lost my sense of time.
Because I was moving muddy metal plates and containers covered in waste oil, my hands were filthy.
Oil was thickly stuck to my clothes, and before I knew it, there were a lot of stains.
Even after that, I crossed the carpet of trash, swam in the river of filth, and was pounded by the waterfall of scrap.
And then, I finally found it.
It was in Mad's shop.
The one I broke yesterday.
That watch.
I picked it up and stared intently at the hands on the face.
Naturally, it wasn't moving.
I put it to my ear, but it didn't make a sound.
It's only natural, since I broke it.
This watch will probably never tick again.
That fact pricked at the depths of my heart.
Gently, I hugged the watch and decided to start heading home.
Shiona will greet me kindly.
"I'm home. I found it."
When I held out the oil-stained trophy, Shiona smiled gently.
"Really, thank you. Here, get changed, get changed."
Shiona had prepared a towel and a change of clothes for me.
After wiping off the dirt and changing, I headed to the living room.
Shiona greeted me there as well.
"Rei, you're tired, aren't you? Eat and rest."
"No, I'm okay. I want to start working right away."
"Are you okay? I'm worried about your body, Rei."
"I'm fine. For some reason, I don't feel tired right now."
"But, you have to eat..."
"Yeah, I know. I'll eat later, so you go ahead and eat first."
"...Okay, I understand. Do your best."
Shiona left the living room.
I watched her go, and then I started working.
I opened the book I borrowed from the library beside me.
This music box has a mechanism where gears of various sizes inside intricately mesh together when the handle is turned, causing the disc to rotate at a constant speed.
Apparently, turning it faster doesn't necessarily make the song play faster.
I thought that was a really amazing technology.
Following the assembly instructions written in the book in reverse order, I disassembled the music box.
Then, as I compared the parts one by one to check if they were all there, I found that a gear in the power transmission section was broken.
So, even with something that moves with such precision, it only takes one small part to fail for it to stop working.
I couldn't help but look at my own right hand.
For now, I'll try to find something the same size as this broken gear from the watch.
I then started disassembling the watch.
I removed the lid and used a screwdriver to remove the screws.
When I removed the cover, the internal structure was exposed.
Gears much more precise than those in the music box meshed together in multiple layers.
One of them, a slightly larger gear, had a broken shaft. That's why the parts can't turn.
I guess this is the place I broke yesterday.
The fact that Mad threw this watch away probably means he didn't have anything the same size as this gear.
Fortunately, the broken gear wasn't the size needed for the music box.
Disassembling things is somehow unsettling.
Because I'm breaking this watch in order to fix the music box.
Perhaps it's because I understand for myself what kind of existence I am.
Hesitantly, but as a small offering, I disassembled the watch as carefully as possible.
I lined up the watch gears on the table, starting with the smallest, and compared them to the music box's.
"...Found it."
I was able to find a gear that seemed to be almost the same size.
All that's left is to transplant this into the music box according to the book.
"I think this should work..."
With this, the disc should move without any problems.
I put the lid back on and turned the handle, and there was a response.
But, the handle won't turn any further than that.
I wonder why.
I reread the book.
The parts and the positions they're assembled in are correct.
Tilting my head, I removed the lid again.
And then, I tried turning the handle as it was.
Certainly, the gears meshed together perfectly.
But, it seems the oil has completely dried up because it hasn't been used for a while.
That must be the reason why the handle won't turn.
What should I do?
Should I go ask Shiona to borrow some cooking oil?
...No, that's also a problem.
The type of oil used for cooking and the lubricant for gears are probably different.
It might move at first, but it could cause a breakdown.
If that's the case, what should I do...?
Suddenly, I looked at my right hand.
Although it's covered by a glove, there are bare mechanical parts underneath.
What about using the oil used in my hand?
I took off my glove and looked closely at my right hand.
Exposed mechanical parts.
Oil is built inside to smoothly move those parts.
I inserted a screwdriver into the palm near the base of my thumb.
When I removed the exterior, it was packed with mechanisms such as wiring, cylinders, and shafts to move my mechanical hand.
One of the cylinders inside contains oil.
And it was detachable so that the old oil could be easily replaced.
I removed the cylinder with my left hand and dripped the oil that filled it onto the gears of the music box.
I spread the oil with my fingertip so that it would blend into all the gears as much as possible.
Will it work?
I returned the cylinder to my right hand and reattached the exterior.
Hiding my mechanical arm with the glove, I tentatively turned the handle.
At first, it was awkward. But, as I turned the handle, the gears ran smoothly.
The oil must have circulated through all the gaps in the gears, and the handle continued to turn without any snag.
And then, that melody begins to play.
"Rei, that song...!"
Shiona suddenly came into the room.
"Yeah. I fixed it, Shiona."
"Thank you... thank you, Rei. Thank you... I'm so, so happy."
Shiona showed me a smile I had never seen before.
Just looking at that smile, the depths of my heart warmed gently.
And then, I realized.
Ah, so this is it.
This is the emotion called happiness.
I am happy now.
I am happy to see Shiona's smile.
And, for the first time, I was able to feel a sense of being useful.
"Thank you, Rei, thank you."
Shiona took my hand and thanked me many times.
As her face drew closer, I felt my face getting hot.
"The music box was fixed thanks to Rei's hard work. I, who had given up, can hear that song again. This orange-colored song that my brother made. This song that I love so much..."
"Hey, Shiona, sing it. Let me hear it, your brother's song."
"Yes... of course!"
I turned the handle of the music box.
Shiona clasped her hands in front of her chest and began to sing along with the melody.
The song she was singing when we met.
A song Shiona's brother made.
An orange-colored song.
I feel like I understand its meaning now.
The emotion dwelling in my heart is joy.
Shiona's song.
And Shiona, singing so happily.
Just watching her, I was overflowing with joy.
More than usual, Shiona seemed so happy as she sang the song.
That day, Shiona kept singing until she fell asleep.
I was also absorbed in her singing voice and the melody.
Over and over, Shiona asked me to play the song.
Until my arm could no longer move, Shiona kept singing.
Looking at her expression, I think.
I want to be with Shiona like this forever.
If Shiona wishes for it, I can be with her forever.
But for that to happen, my true identity must never be revealed.
Never, absolutely never...
That day, I strengthened my resolve to stay with Shiona forever.
Night. The room became dark.
On the two beds lined up next to each other, Shiona speaks to me.
"Will you listen to my request?"
"You see, I want many people to hear this song. And I want to make them smile. I want to make many people happy with this song that my brother made."
I only know the word.
But I didn't know what it was.
Is it a state?
Or is it an emotion?
I repeated the word 'happiness' over and over in my head.
"So, I want you to help me."
"Help? What should I do?"
"Tomorrow, I want you to go to the plaza with me. And I want you to turn the music box."
"And then, Shiona will sing, right?"
"Yes, that's right. And I want as many people as possible to hear it. That orange-colored song that my brother made..."
"Yeah, I want to do that too. Of course, I'll help."
I heard the sound of the sheets rubbing together.
"What's wrong, Shiona?"
"Hey, Rei... can I hold your hand?"
I can't see Shiona's expression in the darkness.
But I felt like Shiona's face was turning red.
"My hand? With me?"
"Yes, I want to hold hands with Rei... Is that... no good...?"
I searched through my knowledge banks.
I know the act of holding hands.
But what it means between a boy and girl of age...
"No, no, it's okay..."
If I'm being asked by a human... by Shiona, then I want to respond.
Fortunately, she's on my left side.
If it's the hand covered in artificial skin, then I don't think there's a problem.
I reach my hand over to the bed next to mine.
In the chilled room, my outstretched hand felt a little cold.
I search for Shiona's hand in the air.
Touching... warmth.
Shiona's hand overlapped mine.
"You're warm, Rei."
"Yeah... you're warm, Shiona."
We held hands.
Without either of us initiating, our fingers intertwined.
Not just warmth from our hands, but a different kind of warmth spread.
Is this the warmth of a human, different from my artificial warmth...?
"Rei... tighter, please."
"...Like this...?"
"Sorry, did it hurt?"
"No... it was just stronger than I expected."
"Is this strength okay?"
"Yes... thank you, Rei."
We held hands all night long.
Until the morning woke us up, our hands remained clasped.
The next day, the plaza was overflowing with sound.
The melody that Shiona and I began to play.
Shiona sang.
And I turned Shiona's brother's music box.
At first, there were no passersby.
But as if drawn in by Shiona's singing voice, their numbers increased.
One person, then two, stopped in their tracks, and soon a small circle formed.
That circle quickly grew larger, and the deserted plaza quickly became bustling with activity.
Everyone there was absorbed in Shiona's singing voice.
A young couple snuggled close, each holding the other's hand.
An old man closed his eyes with deep emotion.
A young man gazed at a woman a little distance away.
A young parent and child laughed joyfully together.
The children were moving their bodies to the rhythm of the song.
Each of them was listening to Shiona's song with their own thoughts.
But there was one thing they all had in common.
That was that everyone was 'smiling'.
Everyone was smiling as they listened to Shiona's song.
Right now, I felt warmth deep in my heart, feeling that I was helping to bring smiles to the faces of the people in this place.
This is the emotion called happiness.
The emotion I felt yesterday when I saw Shiona's smile.
This is what it was.
I am happy.
I felt my cheeks lift slightly.
Surely, I'm smiling too.
It might be a slightly awkward-looking smile.
But that's okay.
If I can get even a little closer to Shiona, I'm satisfied with just that.
The music box, which I had just repaired, continued to play the melody without a hitch.
The handle I'm turning is in good condition too.
The sound flowing from the disc reverberates and amplifies inside the wooden box, becoming a clear tone that goes outside.
According to Shiona, it's an orange-colored melody.
Shiona sings along to that melody.
