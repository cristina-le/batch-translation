──The air shifted.
The pale blue light that had been enveloping me receded.
What I saw then was a grimy ceiling.
My right arm, which I extended towards it, was slightly different from my left arm, which I also extended.
My right arm was made of exposed mechanical parts from the wrist down.
My fingers moved smoothly, but each time, a faint metallic scraping sound echoed.
Next, I slowly raised my upper body.
I realized then that the source of the pale blue light that had been in my field of vision was an oval-shaped lid with a gentle curve.
It seems I was asleep inside this capsule-like thing.
Where is this place?
Who am I?
Why am I here?
Even when I asked myself these questions, I couldn't find the answers.
Even when I tried to trace back my memories, all I had was the memory of the pale blue light.
In order to find a clue to my memories, I decided to get out of the capsule and walk around the room.
Although I knew the act of walking, perhaps it had been a long time since I had done it, as my footing was unsteady.
I paid attention not to fall over, and slowly moved forward.
The drifting air was lukewarm, and each time I took air into my lungs, dust clung to my throat.
Light streamed in from a hole in the ceiling, revealing dust particles in the air along its path.
Perhaps no one has entered this building for quite some time.
A thin layer of dust spreads across the floor.
What kind of place is this?
Countless oval capsules were scattered throughout the large room.
Most of them were open.
The insides were empty.
Even if some were closed, there was nothing inside.
It seems I'm the only one in this room.
…No, that's not quite accurate.
There are people who exist, leaning against the oval objects or lying on the floor.
But, no, that's not right.
Those aren't exactly people.
It would be more accurate to call them humanoid objects.
Those humanoid objects had mechanical parts peeking out from under their skin.
Some had mechanical parts from the neck up.
Some had exposed mechanical arms.
Some had their lower bodies torn off, revealing mechanical parts.
And then, I remembered what those humanoid objects were.
Philoids, created for humans, partners for humans.
Equipped with the five senses, and even emotions, they are the closest existence to humans.
I reach out my hand to a Philoid that has ceased functioning.
The hand with exposed parts, not covered with skin, looked very similar to my right hand.
This is a factory.
I was made here.
…It seems the facility was abandoned for some reason just before completion.
While staring at the mechanical right hand before it was covered with artificial skin, I concluded the most likely possibility.
Having understood my own existence, I started walking towards the wall.
There was an old automatic door there, and right next to it, a liquid crystal panel displaying 《CLOSE》 was covered in dust.
I touched it with my mechanical hand.
The moment I felt something cold like electricity at my bloodless fingertips, it displayed 《OPEN》 and the door opened.
Can I get outside from here?
Is there anyone left in this facility?
I wanted to meet someone.
I wanted to meet a human.
Let's go find them, my partner.
I pushed open the door leading outside.
In order to prove my own existence.
When I returned home, I headed straight for the living room.
There, was a broken music box.
I opened a book I borrowed from the library and began to learn about its structure.
As I thought, the gears inside were chipped.
So no matter how much I turn the handle, the disc won't spin and no sound will come out.
…But, what should I do about this gear?
Would it be possible to make one that matches the size written in the book? No, it's impossible.
With no answer in sight, I turned the page of the book.
At the end of the book, there was a list of products for each manufacturer and a list of parts used.
As I skimmed through it, my gaze caught on something.
What I understood there was that the manufacturer that made this music box also made clocks.
If that's the case, then the parts for the precise sections might be the same as those used in clocks.
Suddenly, I remembered what I broke at Mad's shop.
That clock... if they're going to throw it away because it's unusable...
If I use the gears and other parts from the clock, I might be able to fix the music box.
"Rei, what are you doing?"
At the same time as I saw the possibility of repair, Shiona came into the living room.
"Shiona, listen. I might be able to fix the music box with the parts from the clock that was at Mad's shop."
"Really? Really?"
Shiona was smiling more happily than usual.
From that expression, I could tell Shiona's joy.
"But, don't push yourself too hard. Even without the music box, we can still sing."
Shiona picked up the music box and started singing.
That song she sang in the chapel.
That song, somehow nostalgic.
That song, like a warmth deep in my heart.
Looking at Shiona, who gazes at the music box with affection, my resolve grows stronger.
I want to fix this music box for her.
And, I want Shiona to be happy.
That feeling swells up inside me.
"I'm going to Mad's shop again tomorrow."
I'll try to ask him to give me the clock somehow.
But there was one thing I was worried about.
That is, I was the one who broke that clock.
I apologized, but it's still hard to go there.
I'm terrified of Mad-san yelling at me again.
"You know, I want to make a lot of people smile with this song, Onii-chan."
Shiona's words reached me as I hesitated.
"This song is orange... I'm sure it can turn many people's hearts orange. Because it's a song made with the wish that it would be so. Because that's Onii-chan's wish. So, I want many people to hear this song. And I want to make many people smile. That's my wish."
Shiona said as if to herself.
Those words pushed me forward.
I'll go to Mad's shop again tomorrow.
And, I'll apologize again for breaking the clock.
With Shiona's singing and the music box, I strengthened my resolve.
The next day, I visited Mad's shop alone.
I can't count how many times I thought about turning back on the way.
Each time I thought that, Shiona's smile would flash through my mind.
I want to keep seeing that smile.
To do that, I want to fix the music box for her.
I recalled my resolve from yesterday many times.
What I can do for Shiona.
I steeled myself and stepped into Mad's shop.
"You, what kind of face do you have to show up here?"
Immediately after, Mad's voice, as low as distant thunder, rained down.
I immediately wanted to run away, but I didn't.
"I wanted to apologize more sincerely for yesterday."
"About the clock? You already apologized for that."
"Shiona was there at the time... I thought I should apologize properly, by myself."
"I don't need that. Get out of here."
"I can't do that. I'm truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday."
"No matter how much you apologize, the clock is still broken, leave."
"I'm sorry. I'm so very sorry."
With my head bowed, I continued to apologize.
I wonder how much time had passed.
Eventually, Mad's slightly softer voice reached me.
"...Raise your head."
Doing as I was told, Mad's face, looking somewhat exasperated, was there.
"Jeez... what a guy. You're persistent beyond belief."
"I'm sorry..."
"Don't apologize anymore, or I'll punch you!"
He says that, but there doesn't seem to be as much anger as yesterday.
I thought I heard a small sigh.
"You're done here, right? Get out of here."
"Um... there's just one thing I wanted to ask."
"A request? You've got some nerve asking me for a favor."
The pressure makes my legs tremble, but Shiona's words push me forward.
"That clock... could you let me have it?"
"...Say that again."
"Um... that clock from yesterday, could you let me have it--"
"ARE YOU KIDDING MEEEEEEEEEE!!"
The impact was like being struck by lightning, and I froze stiffly at attention.
"You broke it yourself and now you want me to give it to you? Don't get cocky!"
It's no use... .
I can't take any more than this... .
As I tried to run away, a voice called out from behind.
"Please wait, Mad. Rei only wants to fix my brother's music box."
Shiona, who should have been waiting at home, was there.
Shiona, without being intimidated by Mad, stepped between him and me.
"My brother's music box is broken, and Rei said he'd fix it for me. He just needs the parts for that. He's truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday. So, won't you please forgive him?"
Shiona conveyed this to Mad with an unwavering smile.
"Hmm... Hmmm..."
Mad's face was bright red, but his expression gradually softened.
"But, that clock is gone now. I threw that thing away. However..."
Mad turned his back to us, but continued to speak.
"I threw it away at the abandoned factory on the outskirts of town. I don't know what happened to it after that."
After saying only that, Mad sat down, facing the wall.
"Thank you, Mad."
Shiona bowed without losing her smile and left the store.
"Ah, thank you very much..."
I bowed in the same way and left the store.
"The abandoned factory is very close to where Rei was collapsed, you know."
As soon as we left the store, Shiona told me.
"So, Shiona goes to throw away trash there?"
"That's right. Trash from various places gathers there."
"Could it be that he fixes and sells things he picks up from there?"
"That's right. Mad often goes to that place."
I see, that's why there were so many old things in the store.
He probably brings usable things from that place and reuses them.
In any case, I decided to head to that abandoned factory.
"Shiona, if you don't mind, I'd like you to guide me to that place."
"I'm sorry, the Red Children are coming to my house today."
She must be talking about those kids who were talking to Shiona yesterday.
Come to think of it, I promised to treat them to soup.
"But Rei, you can't go alone, right? I'll go and cancel my promise with the children."
"No, it's okay, Shiona. You should keep your promise."
"But, how are you going to get there?"
"I'll try going to the library. I want to know more about this area, and I want to look at a map."
"The library..."
Shiona's expression seemed to cloud over a little.
"Eh... No, it's nothing... Hey, Rei. Is Tippy-chan fond of Rei?"
"I wonder. I don't think she hates me, but why do you ask?"
"No, it's nothing. If it's the library, I'm sure there's a map. Goodbye."
"Yeah, I will. Well then, see you later."
I turned on my heel and tried to head to the library.
The smile I saw on Shiona's face at that moment seemed to hold some sadness.
But I don't know the reason why.
"Rei, you came."
Tippy was in the same place as yesterday, shedding tears in the same way.
"Yeah, I came. Hey Tippy, can I ask you something?"
"Does this library have a map of the town?"
"Yeah, it does. It has lots of them."
"That's great. Will you guide me to where the maps are?"
"I don't mind... but..."
Tippy was somehow hesitant.
"No, that's not it... that's not it, but..."
"Will you... hold me?"
Tippy's face turned a little red.
Her sad expression hasn't changed, but her cheeks seem a little softer.
"...Hold you? You mean, like I did yesterday?"
"Yeah... is it no good?"
"It's not no good. Here, come here."
"Yeah... yeah..."
When I opened my arms, Tippy stood up and jumped into my chest, somewhat hesitantly.
Unlike yesterday, it's a position where I'm holding her.
But my thoughts are the same.
The Tippy I held was still small, soft, and seemed like she would break.
"Tippy, is this okay?"
"Yeah, it's okay. Rei... you're warm."
Tippy nuzzled my chest.
That gesture warmed the depths of my heart.
Could this be the feeling called love?
I want to protect this girl.
I want to stop these tears.
For a while, I held Tippy close.
"Um, can you walk over there like this?"
Tippy pointed her finger towards the aisle from within my arms.
Still holding her, I headed in the direction she indicated.
"Why do you need a map?"
"Apparently, there's an abandoned factory near the town. I want to go there."
"Why, to the abandoned factory?"
"Because, the parts I'm looking for might be there."
"The music box you were looking at yesterday?"
"Yeah, that's right. I really want to fix Shiona's brother's music box for her."
"Shiona's... I see. I hope you find it."
Still held in my arms, Tippy led me without hesitation to the bookshelf containing the map books.
"Could it be that you remember where each book is?"
"Yeah, mostly."
"That's amazing... Did someone teach you?"
"Nope. I learned by myself while waiting for Papa and Mama."
Upon uttering the words "Papa and Mama," Tippy's eyes became a little teary.
"Um... is it this one?"
To change the subject, I took out one of the map books.
I sat down on the spot and opened the book.
Like the music box book, this map was also handwritten.
Could it be that all the books in this library are handwritten?
If that's the case, that's a considerable amount.
Just who could have handwritten this many books?
The sheer amount of time required for that task makes my head spin.
"It's pretty beat up... About how old is this book?"
"Um... I don't know. It's a really, really, reeeeally old book."
It seemed like a map from decades ago.
The buildings themselves seem the same as the current townscape, though...
The pages are severely faded, as if tea had been spilled on them.
Some were stuck together, and looked like they would tear if I tried to turn them.
I carefully turned the page.
"Ah, could this be it?"
I found a factory map symbol to the north of the town.
Judging from the direction of Shiona's house, there's a high probability that this is the place.
"Ray... are you going? Don't go..."
Tippy clung to my neck.
I stroked her small back with my hand, over and over.
"It's okay, I'll come back."
"Really? Will you really come back again?"
"Yeah, of course. I promise."
"You absolutely will, okay? You absolutely, absolutely have to come back!"
"Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely for sure."
Again and again, I made promises with Tippy.
I wonder why.
Even so, I hesitated to leave the place.
The feeling that I wanted to stay by Tippy's side forever was welling up inside me.
Hiding that feeling, I left the library.
Entering the abandoned factory I reached with the map, the smell of oxidized oil stung my nose.
This factory, too, must have originally been making Philoid arms and legs.
All around, half-finished Philoid arm and leg parts were scattered everywhere.
All of them were before being covered with artificial skin, with the machine parts exposed.
Looking closely, I could see that they were made the same way as my right hand.
Even knowing they were artificial, the sight was bizarre.
To move the arm that was lying on the ground, I pushed it away with my right hand.
The mournful sound of metal clashing against metal echoed throughout the factory.
If something were to break on my body by some chance, I could come here.
Here, there are mountains of replacement parts.
In the back, there were many drums filled with oxidized oil rolling around.
Most of it had oxidized, but there was also some unopened oil inside.
Even if I ran out of oil, I could perform maintenance here without being seen.
The further I went into the factory, the more the worries I had in the back of my mind were resolved.
This abandoned factory should become an important place for me.
But, I can't find the most important thing.
That is, of course, the watch that Mad discarded in this place.
But, inside this factory, there isn't even a watch, or anything that looks like trash.
Could it be that the trash was thrown outside instead of inside the factory?
I left the factory for a while and decided to go around its perimeter.
Then, on the back side of the factory, I found an area where machine parts were piled up high.
There were machine parts, of course, but also a lot of trash thrown away.
Surely this town's garbage dump must be here.
Besides Mad, there must be others who have taken things that could be used from here.
Looking up at the mountain that was several times my height, I thought about that.
"...Now then, where could it be?"
There's a considerable amount of trash.
It would be difficult to find it by searching steadily.
But, there's no other way.
I decided to start searching from my feet immediately.
I don't know how long it took.
I had long since lost my sense of time.
Because I was moving muddy metal plates and containers covered in waste oil, my hands were covered in sludge.
Oil was stuck to my clothes, and before I knew it, there were a lot of stains.
Even after that, I crossed the carpet of trash, swam in the river of filth, and was hit by the waterfall of scrap.
And then, I finally found it.
It was in Mad's shop.
The one I broke yesterday.
That watch.
I picked it up and stared intently at the hands on the dial.
Of course, it wasn't moving.
I put it to my ear, but it didn't make any sound.
It's only natural since I broke it.
This clock will probably never tick again.
That fact pricked the depths of my heart slightly.
Gently, I hugged the clock and decided to head home.
Shiona will gently welcome me.
"I'm home. I found it."
When I held out the oil-stained trophy, Shiona smiled softly.
"Really, thank you. Here, change your clothes, change your clothes."
Shiona had prepared a towel and a change of clothes for me.
After wiping off the dirt and changing, I headed to the living room.
Shiona welcomed me there as well.
"Ray, you must be tired? Eat and rest."
"No, I'm okay. I want to start working right away."
"Are you okay? I'm worried about your body, Ray."
"I'm fine. Strangely, I don't feel tired right now."
"But, you have to eat..."
"Yeah, I know. I'll eat later, so you go ahead and eat first."
"...Okay, I understand. Good luck."
Shiona leaves the living room.
I watched her go, and then I started working.
I opened the book I borrowed from the library beside me.
This music box has a mechanism where gears of various sizes inside intricately mesh together when the handle is turned, keeping the disc rotating at a constant speed.
It seems that turning it faster doesn't necessarily make the song faster.
I thought that was an amazing technology.
Following the assembly instructions written in the book in reverse order, I disassembled the music box.
Then, as I compared the parts one by one, I found that a gear in the power transmission section was broken.
So, even with something that moves with such precision, it only takes one small part to fail for it to stop working.
I couldn't help but look at my right hand.
For now, I'll try to find a gear of the same size as this broken one from the clock.
I then started disassembling the clock.
I removed the lid and used a screwdriver to remove the screws.
When I removed the cover, the internal structure was revealed.
Gears much more precise than those in the music box meshed together in multiple layers.
One of them, a slightly larger gear, had a broken axle. That's why the parts wouldn't turn.
This must be the place I broke yesterday.
The fact that Mad threw this clock away means that he didn't have a gear of the same size.
Fortunately, the broken gear wasn't the size needed for the music box.
Disassembling things makes me feel somewhat hesitant.
Because I'm breaking this clock to fix the music box.
Perhaps it's because I understand what kind of existence I am myself.
Hesitantly, but as a small offering, I disassembled the clock as carefully as possible.
I lined up the clock gears on the table, from smallest to largest, and compared them to the ones from the music box.
"...Found it."
I was able to find a gear that was almost exactly the same size.
All that's left is to transplant this into the music box according to the book.
"I think this should work..."
The disc should move without any problems now.
I put the lid back on and turned the handle, and there was a response.
But the handle won't turn any further.
I wonder why.
I reread the book.
There are no problems with the parts or the positions they're installed in.
Tilting my head, I removed the lid again.
Then, I tried turning the handle as it was.
The gears were certainly meshing perfectly.
But it seems the oil has completely dried up because it hasn't been used for a while.
That must be the reason why the handle won't turn.
What should I do?
Should I go to Shiona and borrow some cooking oil?
...No, that's a problem too.
Cooking oil and gear lubricant are probably different types.
It might work at first, but it could cause a breakdown.
Then, what should I do...?
Suddenly, I looked at my right hand.
Although it's covered by a glove, there are bare mechanical parts underneath.
How about using the oil used in my hand?
I took off my glove and looked closely at my right hand.
Exposed mechanical parts.
Oil is built inside to smoothly move those parts.
I inserted a screwdriver into the palm near the base of my thumb.
When I removed the exterior, it was packed with mechanisms such as wiring, cylinders, and shafts to move the mechanical hand.
One of the cylinders inside contained oil.
And it was detachable so that the old oil could be easily replaced.
I removed the cylinder with my left hand and dripped the oil that filled it onto the gears of the music box.
I spread the oil with my fingertips so that it would blend into all the gears as much as possible.
Will it work?
I returned the cylinder to my right hand and reattached the exterior.
Hiding the mechanical arm with a glove, I cautiously turned the handle as it was.
Clumsily at first. But, as I turned the handle, the gears ran smoothly.
The oil must have circulated through all the gaps in the gears, and the handle continued to turn without any snag.
And that melody begins to flow.
"Rei, that song...!"
Shiona suddenly came into the room.
"Yeah. It's fixed, Shiona."
"Thank you... Thank you, Rei. Thank you... I'm so, so happy."
Shiona showed me a smile I had never seen before.
Just looking at that smile, the depths of my heart warmed up gently.
And then, I realized.
Ah, so this is it.
This is the emotion called happiness.
I am happy now.
I am happy to see Shiona's smile.
And, for the first time, I was able to get a sense of being useful.
"Thank you, Rei, thank you."
Shiona took my hand and thanked me many times.
As her face got closer, I felt my face getting hot.
"Thanks to Rei's hard work, the music box is fixed. I can listen to that song again, which I had given up on. This orange-colored song that my brother made. This song that I love so much..."
"Hey, Shiona, sing it. Let me hear your brother's song."
"Yes... Of course!"
I turn the handle of the music box.
Shiona clasped her hands in front of her chest and began to sing along with the melody.
The song she was singing when we met.
A song Shiona's brother made.
An orange-colored song.
Now I feel like I understand its meaning.
The emotion dwelling in my heart is joy.
Shiona's song.
And Shiona, singing so happily.
Just watching her like that, I was overflowing with joy.
More than usual, Shiona sang that song so happily.
That day, Shiona kept singing until she fell asleep.
I was also absorbed in her singing voice and the tone of the music box.
Over and over, Shiona asked me to play the song.
Until my arm could no longer move, Shiona kept singing.
Looking at that expression, I think.
I want to be with Shiona like this forever.
If Shiona wishes for it, I can be with her forever.
But for that to happen, my true identity must never be revealed.
Never, absolutely never...
That day, I strengthened my resolve to stay with Shiona forever.
Night, the room darkened.
On the two beds placed side by side, Shiona speaks to me.
"Will you listen to my request?"
"You see, I want many people to hear this song. And I want to make them smile. I want to make many people happy with this song that my brother made."
I only know the word itself.
But I didn't understand what it was.
Is it a state of being?
Or is it an emotion?
I repeated the word 'happiness' over and over in my head.
"So, I want you to help me."
"Help? What should I do?"
"Tomorrow, I want you to go to the plaza with me. And I want you to play the music box."
"And then, Shiona, you'll sing, right?"
"Yes, that's right. And I want as many people as possible to hear it. That orange-colored song that my brother made..."
"Yeah, I want to do that too. Of course, I'll help."
I heard the sound of the sheets rubbing together.
"What's wrong, Shiona?"
"Hey, Rei... can I hold your hand?"
I can't see Shiona's expression in the darkness.
But I felt like Shiona's face was turning red.
"Hand? With me?"
"Yeah, I want to hold your hand, Rei... Is that... not okay...?"
I search through my knowledge.
I know the act of holding hands.
But what it means for a boy and girl of our age...
"No, it's okay..."
If I am needed by a human... by Shiona, then I want to respond.
Fortunately, she is on my left side.
If it's the hand covered in artificial skin, I don't think there will be a problem.
I reach my hand out to the bed next to mine.
In the cold room, my outstretched hand felt a little chilly.
I search for Shiona's hand in the air.
Touching, warmth.
Shiona's hand overlapped with mine.
"You're warm, Rei."
"Yeah... you're warm, Shiona."
We held hands.
Without either of us initiating, our fingers intertwined.
Not just warmth from our hands, but a different kind of warmth spread.
Is this the warmth of a human, different from my artificial warmth...?
"Rei... tighter, please."
"...Like this...?"
"Sorry, was that too hard?"
"No... it was just stronger than I expected."
"Is this strength okay?"
"Yeah... thank you, Rei."
We held hands all night long.
Until the morning woke us, our hands remained clasped together.
The next day, the plaza was overflowing with sound.
The melody that Shiona and I began to play.
Shiona sang.
I turned Shiona's older brother's music box.
At first, there were no passersby.
But as if drawn by Shiona's singing voice, their numbers increased.
One, two people stopped, and soon a small circle formed.
That circle quickly grew larger, and the deserted plaza was soon bustling with activity.
Everyone there was listening intently to Shiona's singing.
A young couple snuggled close, holding each other's hands.
An old man closed his eyes with deep emotion.
A young man gazed at a woman a little distance away.
A young parent and child laughed happily together.
The children were moving their bodies to the rhythm of the song.
Each of them was listening to Shiona's song with their own thoughts.
But there was one thing they all had in common.
That was that everyone was 'smiling'.
Everyone was smiling as they listened to Shiona's song.
I felt a warmth deep in my chest, feeling that I was helping to bring smiles to the faces of the people in this place.
This is the emotion of happiness.
The feeling I felt yesterday when I saw Shiona's smile.
This is what it was.
I'm happy.
I felt my cheeks lift slightly.
Surely, I'm smiling too.
It might be a slightly awkward-looking smile.
But that's okay.
If I could get even a little closer to Shiona, I would be satisfied with just that.
The music box, which I had just repaired, continued to play the melody flawlessly.
The condition of the rotating handle is also good.
The sound flowing from the disc resonates and amplifies inside the wooden box, becoming a clear tone that goes outside.
According to Shiona, an orange-colored melody.
Shiona sings along to that melody.
I wished this time could last forever and ever.
This time where people can smile.
And I wanted to keep watching Shiona's happy face as she sang, forever and ever.
Suddenly, my gaze drifted towards the library on the edge of town.
I thought I saw the closed curtains sway slightly.
For a moment, I even saw a small figure.
I know who it is.
That blue-haired girl who's always crying.
It's Tipi.
She's probably still crying right now.
In that lonely library--.
Just thinking about it made my chest ache slightly.
It felt like a thorn had pricked me.
What kind of feelings was Tipi watching this circle with?
A circle of smiles that continues to expand.
Everyone there was smiling and sharing the same feelings.
I noticed that there was one person with a scowl on their face.
That person with the hunched shoulders and crossed arms is Mad.
He, out of place as he is, is the only one with the emotion of 'anger' on his face.
I suddenly met eyes with Mad, who harbored that emotion I didn't yet know.
It was a time shorter than a second.
Mad harrumphed immediately, turned on his heel, and disappeared into the crowd.
Watching him go, I was thinking.
I want to make everyone smile.
Those two expressing sadness and anger.
I want to make Tipi and Mad smile.
But, what should I do?
While turning the handle of the music box, I kept thinking about such things.
After the song ended, I headed to Mad's shop alone.
I couldn't help but be bothered by that scowl from before.
I cautiously stepped into the shop, which was as dim and eerie as ever.
There weren't any customers.
Only Mad was sitting in the chair at the register.
However, something was strange.
Unlike before, he wasn't leaning back in his chair.
He was just staring intently at what seemed to be a small, rectangular chip in his hand.
His expression was still stern, but there was also a hint of loneliness about him.
"Um... Mad-san?"
When I spoke to him, Mad looked flustered and hid the chip in his palm.
"O-oh, what do you want? Why did you come in here without permission?"
"It's not like I did it without permission, it's a shop so anyone can enter, right...?"
"Don't screw with me! You're an impudent brat for entering my shop without my permission!!"
I'm being told something very unreasonable.
"But, Mad-san, you were so focused on that chip that you didn't even notice me coming in."
"I'm talking about the chip you're hiding in your palm."
"I'm not hiding anything!!"
"But I saw it. If you say you're not hiding it, then open your palm and show me what's inside--"
"Shut up and get out! And don't ever come back again!!"
As if pushed out by his words, I was kicked out of Mad's shop.
I came here to make Mad-san smile, but I'm doing the exact opposite.
Shiona was waiting for me in front of the shop.
Her smile warmed the depths of my heart a little.
"Huh? Why is Shiona here?"
"I was worried about where Rei was going, so I followed you."
"I came here thinking I'd make Mad-san smile. But, I made him angry again..."
"Make Mad-san smile...? That's a very difficult thing to do. So don't worry about it. Mad-san getting angry is just a normal occurrence."
"But, today he seemed angrier than usual."
"More than usual? Did something happen?"
"I don't really know, but I asked him about the chip."
"...Chip?"
"Yeah, it was a rectangular chip, small enough to fit in his palm. Mad-san was staring intently at it..."
I used my fingers to show Shiona the size of the chip Mad-san was holding.
Shiona's eyes widened slightly, as if she knew something about the chip.
"Could it be that you asked him about that chip?"
"That's right. Then, he suddenly got angry--"
"Yeah, yeah, I see. Rei, it can't be helped."
"Can't be helped? What do you mean?"
"That chip is Mad-san's treasure."
"Mad-san's treasure? What's inside it?"
"It should contain a movie that Mad-san's son made."
"His son's movie? Is Mad-san's son a movie director?"
"Yes, that's right. Although, he left this town quite a while ago and hasn't come back since."
Shiona said, her eyes fixed on the shop.
A strange expression that mixed two emotions: one of being troubled, but not letting her smile fade...
"But, why is he just staring at the chip? He should just watch the movie."
"That's impossible. There's no equipment in this town that can play that chip."
"So, Mad-san is staring at it like that because he wants to see it but can't?"
"I'm sure that's it. He's shy, so he won't say it out loud."
At that moment, I had an idea.
A way to make Mad-san, who always has a scowl and is always angry, smile.
"No, it's nothing. Shiona, I have a place I want to stop by, so go on back."
"A place you want to stop by...?"
"Yeah, there's something I want to look into."
"...The library?"
I thought Shiona looked somewhat surprised.
I wonder if she's worried about me, since I'm still not used to the town.
"I promise I won't be late."
I said clearly, trying to ease Shiona's worries.
Shiona opened her mouth as if to say something, but closed it immediately.
And once. She bit her lip lightly for just a moment, then smiled.
"...Okay. Be careful, Rei."
I parted ways with Shiona in front of Mad-san's shop and started walking through town alone.
The inside of the library was as dim as ever, and the air was stagnant.
I headed straight through the maze-like interior without hesitation.
Towards the blue girl who is always crying--.
"Rei, you came."
Tipi stood up and ran over to me when she saw me.
I gently held her small body.
"Yeah, because I promised."
"Thank you, Rei. I'm so happy."
Tipi has her face buried in my stomach.
I could feel her tears flowing through my clothes.
"Tipi, what were you doing?"
"Drawing, come here Rei."
I took her hand, and walked as Tipi led me.
Where Tipi was sitting, there was drawing paper and crayons scattered around.
Inside the drawing paper, there was a picture that was being drawn.
"Did you draw this, Tipi?"
"Yeah. I draw one every day."
Tipi said that, and restarted her drawing.
I peeked into the picture.
There was a picture of a singing girl, and a boy turning a music box.
"Tipi, could this be..."
"It's Rei and Shiona. Singing in the plaza."
So Tipi was watching us through the curtains after all.
When I imagine Tipi watching us all alone, for some reason, the depths of my heart ached.
"Rei, what's wrong? Is something the matter?"
The eyes of the girl looking up at me were filled with sorrow.
As if to comfort that emotion, I placed my hand on Tipi's head.
"I'm okay, it's nothing. It's a very good picture."
"Yeah... Thank you, I'm happy."
When I stroked her head, Tipi snuggled up to me affectionately.
But that face was ephemeral, and sad--.
I sincerely wanted to see this child's smile.
"You said you draw one every day, but are there other pictures?"
"Yeah, there are. Rei, come here."
Tipi stood up, took my hand, and led me to the back of the library.
There, the pictures were.
Tipi must have put them up herself, as many pictures were pasted in a low position on the wall.
"This is the picture I drew yesterday, this is the day before that, this is the day before that..."
Tipi explained each one to me.
A picture of a girl holding hands with a young man, looking happy.
A young man and another girl visiting the girl.
And, a picture of a girl crying alone.
Ah, I see.
This is Tipi's picture diary.
From then on, there were pictures of a girl continuing to cry alone.
Since I came here, Tipi is no longer alone.
The expression of the girl in the picture seemed to be softening a little.
Surely that is Tipi's own emotion.
But it was nothing more than something still pregnant with sadness.
I wanted to make this girl smile too.
What can I do for that?
I can't think of an answer.
The only thing I can say is that I'll be by Tipi's side like this.
"Hey, Rei, what kind of book did you come to look for today?"
Tipi, still with a sad expression, tugged at my sleeve and looked up at me.
"I'm looking for a device that can project images... Do you know of any books that might have information about that?"
"Yeah, there is. It's a little far from here, though."
"Will you guide me?"
"Yeah, okay. Here!"
And then Tipi spread her arms wide.
The bear plushie in her right hand dangled in the air.
"Carry me."
I picked Tipi up in my arms.
Just like before, she snuggled her cheek against my chest.
"It's that way, Rei."
And so, I began to be guided to the book I was looking for.
The book was on the second floor of the library--.
A corner of the shelf where materials on images from all over the world, such as projectors and projection machines, are gathered.
"The book you want to read is definitely here."
The books lined up on the bookshelf were all handwritten, just like the music box books and maps.
However, there seem to be quite a few types of projectors, some using film and some using discs.
"What kind are you looking for?"
"I'm looking for something that can project a chip about this size, do you know of any?"
I used my fingers to show the size of the chip that Mad had.
"Hmm... a square? Or a square with one corner missing?"
"The corner was... like it was missing diagonally... I think."
I hadn't looked at it very closely, so I couldn't say for sure.
But Tipi nodded slightly.
"That shape, is it the chip that Mad has?"
"Yeah, it's the chip that Mad had."
I was surprised that Tipi knew about Mad, but he's the owner of the general store in this town, so there was nothing strange about it.
Shiona knew about Mad's chip too, and maybe everyone in town knows about it.
And the fact that Mad is stubborn and won't show the contents is probably common knowledge.
"Um, well... if that's the case... then... this."
Standing on her tiptoes, Tipi pointed to a book that was on the very edge of the shelf she could reach.
"That's amazing, Tipi. You really do remember the location of all the books."
"Ehehe. I got praised."
Tipi pressed her face against my stomach.
While patting her head, I picked up the book and checked its contents.
It was more like an instruction manual than a book.
『Mume Company Projector』──The types of playable media and chips are written in detail.
The internal structure and wiring are also carefully written down.
It seems to be a projection-type player that can project the contents recorded on a portable chip onto a screen or a white wall.
If I can find this device, I can show Mad the movie inside the chip.
"Thank you, Tipi, I found the information I wanted."
"...Are you leaving already?"
Tipi looked up at me with a sad expression.
"...Yeah, sorry."
"Nooo. Don't go."
Perhaps she intended to stop me from leaving.
Tipi hugged me.
That innocent warmth shook my resolve.
But, I have to go.
Because I want to make Mad happy right now.
Because I want to see Mad's smile.
"Tipi, I promise. I'll definitely come again tomorrow."
"Tomorrow...? Really...?"
"Yeah, really. I promise."
"...You won't disappear?"
"Yeah, I won't disappear. I'll come to see you every day, without fail."
"...Okay. I'll be waiting."
With lingering reluctance, I left the library, leaving behind the blue-haired girl──Tipi.
"You came again! What did you come here for!!!"
As soon as I visited the shop, Mad's angry roar greeted me.
I want to run away.
I want to cover my ears.
But, I didn't.
Because I wanted to make Mad's wish come true.
"Mad, I have a request. Please lend me your son's chip."
"That chip that contains your son's movie."
"Why should I lend it to you, don't be ridiculous!!"
"Please... please."
"Enough with your meddling! It's a nuisance!"
"I... I want to be helpful to Mad!!"
"Helpful, you say?"
The fear started to work on me as Mad's glare became even sharper, and my throat constricted.
I couldn't put strength into the movable parts of my knees, and I also felt a floating sensation.
I want to run away right now... but, I can't hesitate here.
"I heard about the chip from Shiona. That your son left town to become a film director. And that movie was sent from your son, right? But you couldn't watch it because you didn't have the playback device, am I wrong?"
In order to suppress my fear, I spoke rapidly.
Perhaps taken aback by my momentum, Mad looked at me with a slightly surprised expression.
"I just went to the library. To find out what kind of device is needed to play it."
"You... you went to the library...?"
Mad looked even more surprised at the word 'library'.
"Yes... I'll find a device that can play that chip. Even if the player is broken, I'll fix it. If I can't find one, I'll even try to make one by piecing together various parts."
"Why would you go so far? It's none of your business."
"It may be true that it's none of my business. But, I want to do it."
"I want to be helpful to Mad... that's all. So, please."
Silence follows.
Is this a silence of affirmation, or--.
"That guy was the worst idiot son."
Mad sat down in his chair and looked up at the ceiling.
And with a somewhat sad expression, he began to talk to me.
All we ever did was fight.
Whenever we met, a fight would always start.
So, at some point, he started avoiding me.
No, maybe I was the one who was avoiding him.
Anyway, we stopped seeing each other as often.
So when he told me he wanted to talk, I was surprised.
"I'm leaving this town."
"Leaving town? What are you talking about?"
"I'm leaving this town to become a movie director. I really do love movies."
"Stop talking about dreams and look at reality. Someone like you can't be a director. There's no way you can do it."
"Don't just assume it's impossible! You won't know unless you try!"
"I know, I'm your father. No one will watch a movie by a director without talent."
"There are people who recognize me! I've even had results! You're just the one who won't acknowledge it!"
"I can't even dream in a town like this!"
"A town like this? Say that again."
"I'll say it as many times as you want. I can't stand a life spent in a town like this, in a shop like this, for the rest of my life."
"You... that's enough..."
"I'll say it as many times as I want! You're just afraid of changing!"
"Ever since Mom died, you've been doing the same thing every day--"
Without thinking, I hit him.
"...You're always resorting to violence. I've had enough."
"...I see. Get out."
"Yeah, I will. Just keep doing the same thing here forever."
My son left home.
And since then, he hasn't even sent a single message.
The only thing he sent was this movie on a chip.
How am I supposed to watch it when I don't have a player?
I can't forgive him for being so selfish.
I don't want to watch a movie like this.
I especially don't want to see his face.
I was surprised at Mad-san's uncharacteristic loquacity.
The more I heard his feelings, the more my own feelings swelled.
If Mad-san really hated his son, he wouldn't need to keep a chip he couldn't play.
If his son hated Mad-san, he wouldn't have sent him the movie he made.
Surely, he wants Mad-san to see this movie.
I think he sent that chip to Mad-san with some kind of feeling.
That's why I want to show this movie to Mad-san.
I lowered my head again.
"Please! Lend me the chip!"
Mad-san came in front of me in silence.
I was prepared to be yelled at, but I no longer felt fear.
More than that, my desire to be helpful to Mad-san was stronger.
But Mad-san handed me the chip he was holding.
"Do as you please."
I stared again at the chip I received.
It was a metal core covered with organic glass, running iridescent electronic circuits.
It was something I knew. A general-purpose chip also used for Philoid's memory backup.
It had become a world standard, and most manufacturers had adopted this format.
If that's the case, it might be playable even without a Mume Corporation projector.
I clenched the chip and lowered my head towards Mad-san.
A deserted factory on the outskirts of town.
I had set foot in a pile of garbage behind it.
I thought that if there was a device to play Mad-san's chip, it would be in this abandoned factory.
If it were in the town, he would have played it long ago.
There is a lot of equipment mixed in with the garbage.
Things with broken wiring, things that have rusted.
As far as I can see, it's all unusable.
The possibility of finding the projector itself in this place is low. But I think I can find some parts, such as the board.
That's right, as I told Mad-san, I'll connect the parts and assemble them so that I can play the chip.
This is the only place I can rely on.
If I don't do something here, Mad-san will have that expression forever.
I won't let that happen.
I don't want that to happen.
With that one thought in mind, I tear down the scrap heap.
But no matter how much I search, I can't find the equipment I'm looking for.
I'm sure Mad-san must have searched for it before.
No... maybe Mad-san is still searching for it even now.
Shiona said that Mad-san fixes things he picks up at this garbage dump and sells them at the general store.
I wonder if his real purpose was to find a projector to play his son's chip.
If that's the case, I wonder how Mad-san feels, having been unable to find it until now...
Instead of a projector, he picks up something else... I wonder what he was thinking when he was repairing it...
I broke Mad-san's watch.
Ah... I see... so that's why Mad-san was angry.
That watch was something in the process of Mad-san trying to get back something important to him.
This is speculation. But I want to believe that's the case.
If so, I won't be able to easily find what Mad-san has been searching for all along.
Even so, I won't give up.
Finding the projector would be the greatest atonement for Mad-san for breaking the watch...
It was when I dragged a piece of equipment larger than my body.
I felt a strange sensation in my right hand.
A very small discomfort... I feel a stiffness in the movement of the joints in my fingers.
I wonder if the oil has run out, or if something has broken down.
It might not be a good idea to continue working like this.
I couldn't stop moving my hands.
Mad-san must have searched everywhere within my reach.
I look up at the mountain of scrap metal piled up far higher than my height.
If it's me, who weighs less than Mad-san, I might be able to climb it.
Thinking that, I immediately started climbing the unkempt, awkward stairs.
I could feel water hitting my back.
Large raindrops were pouring down from the sky I looked up at.
"Rei, let's stop now."
A voice came from a position lower than my feet.
When I turned around, Shiona was there.
She was looking up at me, getting wet in the rain.
"It's raining. You'll catch a cold if you stay like this."
"I'm okay, I'll look a little more, thank you."
"Even if you don't find it, Mad-san will be happy that you tried so hard."
"I'm okay, Shiona. Just a little more."
I continued working.
From behind me, Shiona spoke to me unilaterally.
"But you're already soaking wet. Let's stop. You're tired, aren't you? No one will blame Rei for giving up."
As if to soothe me.
"I'm worried about your body, let's stop, okay? I'll be sad if you get hurt, Rei... Giving up is also important."
"There might be other ways, so let's go home today. I'm preparing orange fluffy soup."
"Let's go home... Rei, let's go home... Hey, Rei... I'm worried about you, Rei..."
Even so, I continued.
Undaunted by the pouring rain, I kept searching.
I pulled out a rusted iron plate.
At that moment, a small avalanche of scrap metal occurred.
I retreated, dodging the scrap metal that pierced the ground with a roar.
"Look out, Rei!"
Turning around at Shiona's voice, I saw a mountain of scrap metal pouring down from behind.
The mountain piled up behind me was also avalanching in the same way.
While being swallowed up, I somehow ran up the collapsing scrap metal.
After a while, the avalanche subsided, and only the sound of rain remained around us again.
"Are you okay, Rei? Are you hurt?"
"Yeah, somehow... that was close."
"Really... I'm glad you're safe, so glad..."
Shiona let out a sigh of relief.
As if to prove I was safe, I stood up.
"Ah... Rei, that."
Shiona pointed at my feet with wide eyes.
The mountain of scrap metal that had collapsed earlier. Among it, there was a piece of equipment that I recognized.
It was the same equipment that was in the book Tipi had shown me.
I dug it out, and when I looked at the surface of the device, it was marked with the faded letters 'Mium'.
"I found it... Shiona, this is it! I found it!"
I lifted it up high so Shiona could see it.
The water that had accumulated inside flowed out as it tilted.
"I did it, I did it, Shiona! I finally found it! Now Mad will be able to watch the movie!"
"Yeah, but... I think that machine is broken...?"
"Huh?"
When Shiona said that, I brought the hand holding the device in front of my eyes.
Certainly, the device I found—'Mium Corporation's projector'—had obvious signs of damage.
The lens part needed for projection was missing.
Also, there was a large crack in the upper part, and when I peeked inside, the internal circuit board was covered in rust.
With this, it's impossible to project a movie.
"That's too bad... Rei, shall we go home now?"
Shiona offered her hand.
I placed my own hand on top of hers.
That warmth warmed my rain-chilled hand.
By the time we returned to town, the rain had stopped.
But the inside of my heart didn't clear up.
Can I really repair the projector that I'm holding in both hands?
In my heart, I was determined to fix it, but now that I've seen how tattered it is, that resolve is wavering.
"What's wrong, being so soaking wet?"
On the way back to the church, I was suddenly called out.
Standing there when I turned around was the director of the photo studio who had taken our picture before.
I was just looking for something.
Looking for something...? I see. So, did you find what you were looking for?
Yes... but...
Is something the matter?
We found it, but it's broken and unusable.
Shiona answered for me, as I was feeling down.
I see. That's too bad. By the way, what were you planning to use it for?
Actually... I was hoping to play the chip that Mad has.
Mad's? The chip that was sent from his son, right?
...Yes. I thought I could make Mad-san, who is always angry, happy...
Is that something you truly want to do from the bottom of your heart?
The director asked gently, yet as if testing me.
Yes, of course.
I answered without hesitation.
Mad-san... always has an angry face and looks very pained. I think if there's some kind of trigger, he'll smile. I think people can become happy if they can laugh. And I think other people who see that can also become happy.
Having said that much, I look at Shiona.
I... learned that from Shiona.
Shiona looked surprised at my words, but immediately smiled.
Yes, that's the expression. Someone's smile makes the people around them feel happy too.
The moment Shiona smiled at me, my heart also warmed.
I see... Can I see that?
The director pointed to the projector I was holding. I silently handed over the broken device.
The photo studio director looked over the device carefully.
I see, this is terrible. There are too many things missing to even try to fix it.
Hearing that from the director, who takes care of cameras on a regular basis, makes me feel discouraged.
Perhaps noticing my depressed mood, the director gave a wry smile and returned the projector.
Let's go home soon, Rei? You'll catch a cold.
That's right. It's bad for your body to stay wet in the rain. We should go home and change first.
Any more than this and we'll be troubling the director too much.
Even if I'm okay, the human Shiona will catch a cold.
Hugging the projector, I bowed to the director and we headed towards the church.
When we returned to the church, Shiona wiped my head with a fluffy towel.
Gently, softly, dabbing carefully so as not to rub.
That was too bad about the projector.
...Yeah, but that place was originally a garbage dump, so it's only natural that it's broken.
It's something I should have realized if I'd thought about it a little. But I was hoping for a convenient outcome.
That if I wished for it, something would happen. That if I worked hard, results would always follow.
Reality isn't that sweet, I'm made to realize.
It can't be helped. You did your best, Rei, no one will complain.
But... but, I wanted to show Mad the movie.
Yeah... Rei, you're so kind.
It's not kindness or anything like that. I just think it's my role.
But, just that feeling alone will make Mad happy. That's enough.
I hope so...
For now, let's warm up, okay? I'll make you a drink that'll warm your body and soul.
Folding the towel she used to wipe my head, Shiona smiled and headed towards the kitchen.
I sat down on a chair and sighed.
I look at the broken projector on the table.
...No, there's no point in being depressed.
Even though it's broken, if you think about it, we've made some progress from where we started with nothing.
If I fix this projector little by little, I should be able to play the chips someday.
The book I borrowed from Tipi had instructions on how to disassemble it for maintenance.
If I unravel it in order, I should be able to fix it.
I can look for the missing parts one by one at that factory.
I want to see Mad smile. I want to see a look of joy like Shiona's when the music box was fixed.
I renew my resolve to fix the projector.
Just then, I notice that the church's main hall is getting noisy.
Excuse me.
I opened the door and peeked out, and there was the director of the photo studio.
And behind him, even more townspeople.
What's going on?
When I asked, looking puzzled, the townspeople offered me something with smiles on their faces.
This is a part from our broken clock. Feel free to use it if you want.
I thought this wiring might fit.
Use my light.
No, use mine.
We have a lot of tools at home, so use as many as you need.
Various electrical components, wiring equipment, electronic circuits, gears, and screws were placed on the table one after another.
Unable to understand the scene, I was stunned, and the director smiled kindly.
Um... what is this?
You're going to fix that projector, right? When I told everyone about it, they brought things that they thought might be needed. There may be some unnecessary items, but it's better to have materials than not, right?
But why...?
Everyone was moved by your and Shiona's music and song. They really wanted to thank you. ...I'm one of those people too.
The director took out a lens and handed it to me.
This... It's a camera lens, but I wonder if it will fit?
I felt something warm deep inside my chest.
And that warmth gradually welled up and up.
Eventually, that warmth reached the back of my eyes, becoming hotter and hotter.
The words wouldn't come together in my head. I wanted to say something, but only my lips trembled.
Shiona, holding a steaming cup, was gently watching me like that.
Shiona... my chest feels warm. I wonder why.
Rei, that's an emotion called 'joy'.
Saying that, she approached me and handed me a cup filled with a drink with a heart-warming aroma.
Everyone is responding to your desire to make Mad smile, Rei. Everyone wants to make Mad happy, with you at the center.
I wonder if I'm being a nuisance... even though I started this on my own.
If they thought you were a nuisance, they wouldn't be smiling so warmly.
I looked at the townspeople who had brought the parts, one by one.
They held up their respective parts in their hands so I could see them, and smiled at me.
...Thank you, everyone.
Using the parts and tools I received, I started the repairs on the spot.
I proceeded with the help of various people in areas that I couldn't understand on my own.
I removed the moisture, carefully scraped off the rusted parts with a file, and repaired the broken electronic circuits with copper foil.
I corrected the solder that was about to come off using the tip of a screwdriver heated until it turned red.
No, no, it's not like that, it's like this.
No, no, it should be like this here.
You're both wrong! It's definitely like this here!
No, it's not like this, it's like that.
Noisily, but cheerfully, the repairs were carried out by everyone.
And then, finally...
The repairs were finished in a patchwork, awkward state.
Thank you, everyone.
It's nothing. In return, let us hear that song again.
The children love it. Please do it again.
Listening to it with him really sets the mood.
Listening to that song... it reminds me of the old days...
I love that song, it's so fun!
An awkward device made by everyone.
It looked nothing like what I had seen in books.
But it was a one-of-a-kind projector, made by everyone.
I felt more joy than I ever had before.
Everyone there was genuinely happy about its completion.
All that's left is to test it out.
Hearing the words 'test run', I looked around the room.
Come to think of it, I've never seen electricity in this town.
The photographer was using an analog camera, too.
Um... is it possible that this town doesn't have electricity...?
At my question, everyone in the room simultaneously gasped.
It was an awkwardness, like I had touched on something I shouldn't have.
