The air shifted. The pale blue light that had enveloped me began to recede. What came into view was a grimy ceiling. My right arm, extended towards it, was slightly different from my left. My right arm was made of exposed mechanical parts from the wrist down. My fingers moved smoothly, but each time, a faint metallic scraping sound echoed. Then, I slowly raised my upper body. I realized that the pale blue light I had seen was coming from an oval-shaped lid with a gentle curve. It seemed I had been asleep inside this capsule-like container. Where am I? Who am I? Why am I here? I asked myself, but found no answers. When I tried to trace back my memories, all I could find was the memory of the pale blue light. To find a clue to my memories, I decided to get out of the capsule and walk around the room. I knew the act of walking, but it had been a while, and my footing was unsteady. I paid attention not to fall, and slowly moved forward. The air was lukewarm, and each time I inhaled, dust clung to my throat. Light streamed in from a hole in the ceiling, revealing dust particles in the air along its path. It seemed that no one had entered this building for quite some time.
A thin layer of dust covered the floor. What was this place used for? Countless oval capsules were scattered throughout the large room. Most of them were open. Their contents were empty. Even the ones that were closed contained nothing inside. It seemed I was the only one in this room. …No, that wasn't quite right. There were figures leaning against the oval objects or lying on the floor. But, no. That's not quite right. Those aren't exactly people. It would be more accurate to call them humanoid objects. These humanoid objects had mechanical parts visible beneath their skin. Some had mechanical parts instead of heads. Others had exposed mechanical arms. Some had their lower bodies torn off, revealing the machinery inside. And then, I remembered what those humanoid objects were. Phiroids, created for humans, partners for humans. Equipped with five senses and even emotions, the closest existence to humans. I reached out my hand towards a Phiroid that had ceased functioning.
The exposed parts of the hand, not covered by skin, were strikingly similar to my right hand. This is a factory. I was created here. …But the facility was likely abandoned for some reason just before completion. I stared at my mechanical right hand, not yet covered with artificial skin, and concluded the most likely possibility. Having understood my own existence, I started walking towards the wall. There was an old automatic door, and right next to it, an LCD panel displaying "CLOSE" was covered in dust. I touched it with my mechanical hand. The moment my bloodless fingertips felt something cold like electricity, it displayed "OPEN" and the door opened. Could I get outside from here? Was there anyone left in this facility? I wanted to meet someone. I wanted to meet a human. Let's go find them, my partner. I pushed open the door leading outside. To prove my own existence. When I returned home, I headed straight for the living room. There, a broken music box sat. I opened a book I had borrowed from the library and studied its structure. Just as I thought, a gear inside was broken.
That's why no matter how much I turn the handle, the disc won't spin and no music plays. …But what should I do about this gear? Would it be possible to make one that matches the size described in the book? No, it's impossible. With no answer in sight, I continued turning the pages of the book. At the end of the book, there was a list of products from each manufacturer, and a list of the parts used. As I skimmed through it, my eyes caught on something. What I learned there was that the manufacturer of this music box also made clocks. If that's the case, then the precise parts might be the same as those used in clocks. Suddenly, I remembered something I broke at Madd's shop. That clock… if he's going to throw it away because it's unusable… If I use the gears and other parts from the clock, I might be able to fix the music box. "Rei, what are you doing?" Just as I saw a possibility of repair, Shiona came into the living room. "Shiona, listen. I might be able to fix the music box with parts from the clock that was at Madd's shop." "Really? Is that true?" Shiona wore an even more joyful smile than usual. From that expression, I could tell how happy Shiona was. "But don't push yourself too hard. We can still sing, even without the music box." Shiona picked up the music box and began to sing. That song she sang in the chapel.
That song, somehow nostalgic. That song, that warms the depths of my heart. Seeing Shiona gazing so lovingly at the music box, my resolve only strengthens. I want to fix this music box for her. And I want to make Shiona happy. That feeling swells within me. "I'm going to Madd's shop again tomorrow." I'll try asking him if he'll give me the clock somehow. But there's only one thing that worries me. And that's the fact that I broke that clock. I apologized, but it's still hard to go back there. The thought of Madd yelling at me again fills me with dread. "You know, I want to make a lot of people smile with my brother's song." Shiona's words reached me as I hesitated. "This song is orange... I'm sure it can paint a lot of people's hearts orange. It's a song created with the wish for that to happen. Because that's my brother's wish. So, I want a lot of people to hear this song. And I want to make a lot of people smile. That's my wish." Shiona said, as if talking to herself. Those words pushed me forward. I'll go to Madd's shop again tomorrow. And I'll apologize again for breaking the clock. With Shiona's singing and the music box, I strengthened my resolve.
The next day, I visited Madd's shop alone. I lost count of how many times I thought about turning back along the way. Each time, Shiona's smile flashed through my mind. I want to keep seeing that smile. To do that, I want to fix the music box for her. I recalled yesterday's resolution over and over again. What I can do for Shiona. I steeled myself and stepped into Madd's shop. "What kind of face do you think you can show around here?" Immediately, Madd's voice, as low as distant thunder, rained down on me. I wanted to run away immediately, but I didn't. "I wanted to apologize more sincerely for yesterday." "About the clock? You already apologized for that." "Shiona was there then… I thought I should apologize properly, by myself." "I don't need that. Get outta here." "I can't do that. I'm truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday." "No matter how much you apologize, the clock's still broken. Get out." "I'm sorry. I'm really sorry." With my head bowed, I continued to apologize. I wonder how much time had passed.
Eventually, Madd's voice, a little softer now, reached me. "... Raise your head." Doing as I was told, I saw Madd's face, looking somewhat exasperated. "Jeez... what a guy. You're persistent as hell." "I'm sorry..." "Don't apologize anymore, or I'll punch ya!" He said that, but there didn't seem to be as much anger as yesterday. I thought I heard a small sigh. "You're done here, right? Get outta here." "Um... there's just one thing I wanted to ask." "A favor? You've got some nerve asking me for a favor." The pressure made my legs tremble, but Shiona's words pushed me forward. "That clock... would you give it to me?" "... Say that again." "Um... that clock from yesterday, would you give it to--" "Are you kidding meeeeeeeeeee!" The impact was like being struck by lightning, and I froze at attention. "You broke it yourself and now you want me to give it to you? Don't get cocky!" This is no good... I can't take any more of this...
As I tried to run, a voice called out from behind. "Please wait, Madd. Rei just wants to fix my brother's music box." There stood Shiona, who should have been waiting at home. Shiona, without being intimidated by Madd, stepped between us. "My brother's music box is broken, and Rei said he'd fix it for me. He just needs the parts for that. He's truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday too. So, won't you please forgive him?" Shiona conveyed this to Madd with an unwavering smile. "Hmm... hmmm..." Madd's face was bright red, but his expression gradually softened. "But that clock's gone now. I threw that thing away. However..." Madd turned his back to us, but continued to speak. "I threw it away at the abandoned factory on the edge of town. I don't know what happened to it after that." After saying only that, Madd slumped down, facing the wall. "Thank you, Madd." Shiona bowed without losing her smile and left the shop. "Ah, thank you very much..." I bowed in the same way and left the shop. "The abandoned factory is very close to where Rei collapsed," Shiona told me as soon as we left the shop. "Is that the place Shiona goes to throw away trash?" "That's right. Trash from all sorts of places gathers there."
"Do you fix up things you find there and sell them here?" "That's right. Madd often goes to that place." I see, so that's why there were so many old things in the shop. He probably brings usable items from that place and reuses them. In any case, I decided to head to that abandoned factory. "Shiona, if you don't mind, I'd like you to guide me to that place." "I'm sorry, the Red Children are coming to my house today." Those must be the children who were talking to Shiona yesterday. Come to think of it, she promised to treat them to soup. "But Rei, you can't go alone. I'll go and cancel my promise with the children." "No, it's okay, Shiona. You should keep your promise." "But, how will you get there?" "I'll try going to the library. I want to know more about this area, and I'd like to look at a map." "The library..." Shiona's expression seemed to cloud over slightly. "Eh... oh, it's nothing... Hey, Rei. Is Tipi attached to you?" "I wonder. I don't think she dislikes me, but why do you ask?" "Oh, it's nothing. I'm sure there's a map at the library. Goodbye." "Yeah, I'll do that. Well then, see you later." I turned on my heel and started to head towards the library.
The smile Shiona showed at that moment seemed to hold a hint of sadness, or so I thought. But I don't know the reason why. "Rei, you came to see me." Tipi was in the same place as yesterday, crying in the same way. "Yeah, I came. Hey Tipi, can I ask you something?" "Does this library have a map of the town?" "Yeah, it does. Lots of them." "That's good. Will you guide me to where the maps are?" "I will... but..." Tipi seemed hesitant about something. "No, that's not it... that's not it, but..." "Will you hold me?" Tipi's face turned a little red. Her sad expression hadn't changed, but her cheeks seemed a little softer. "... Hold you? You mean like I did yesterday?" "Yeah... is that bad?" "It's not bad. Here, come here." "Okay... okay..." When I opened my arms, Tipi stood up and jumped into my chest, somewhat hesitantly. Unlike yesterday, I ended up holding her in my arms.
But my thoughts are the same as before. The Tipi I held was still small, soft, and seemed like she could break at any moment. "Tipi, is this okay?" "Yeah, it's okay. Rei... you're warm." Tipi nuzzled my chest. That gesture warmed the depths of my heart. Could this be the emotion called affection? I want to protect this girl. I want to stop these tears. For a while, I just held Tipi close. "Um, walk that way while holding me." Tipi pointed her finger towards the aisle from within my arms. Still holding her, I headed in the direction she indicated. "Why do you need a map?" "There seems to be an abandoned factory near the town. I want to go there." "Why to the abandoned factory?" "There might be a part I'm looking for there." "The music box you were looking at yesterday?" "Yeah, that's right. I really want to fix Shiona's brother's music box." "Shiona's... I see. I hope you find it."
Still holding me, Tipi led me without hesitation to the bookshelf containing the map books. "Do you remember where all the books are, by any chance?" "Yeah, mostly." "That's amazing... Did someone teach you?" "Nope. I learned by myself while waiting for my mom and dad." When she said the words "mom and dad," Tipi's eyes became a little teary. "Um... is this it?" To change the subject, I took out one of the map books. I sat down on the spot and opened the book. Like the music box book, this map was also handwritten. Could it be that all the books in this library are handwritten? If so, that's a considerable amount. Just who could have handwritten this many books? The sheer amount of time required for that task makes my head spin. "It's pretty beat up... How old is this book?" "Um... I don't know. It's a really, really, reeeeally old book." It seemed like a map from decades ago. The buildings themselves seem to be the same as the current townscape, though... The pages are badly faded, like someone spilled tea on them. Some of them are stuck together and look like they'll tear if I turn them.
I carefully turned the page. "Ah, could this be it?" I found a factory symbol to the north of town. Considering the direction of Shiona's house, there's a high probability this is the place. "Rei... are you going? Don't go..." Tipi clung to my neck. I gently stroked her small back with my hand, again and again. "It's okay, I'll come back." "Really? Will you really come back?" "Yeah, of course. I promise." "You promise? You absolutely, absolutely have to come back!" "Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely." Again and again, I made promises with Tipi. I wonder why. Even so, I hesitated to leave. A feeling of wanting to stay by Tipi's side forever welled up inside me. Hiding that feeling, I left the library. Relying on the map, I entered the abandoned factory and was immediately hit by the smell of oxidized oil. This factory probably used to make Phiroid arms and legs as well. All around me, unfinished Phiroid arm and leg parts were scattered everywhere.
These were all before the artificial skin was applied, with the mechanical parts exposed. Looking closely, I could see that they were made the same way as my right hand. Even knowing they were artificial, the sight was bizarre. To move one of the arms that was lying around, I pushed it aside with my right hand. The mournful sound of metal clashing against metal echoed through the factory. If, by some chance, any part of my body were to break, I could come here. There are mountains of replacement parts here. Deeper inside, there were several drums filled with oxidized oil. Most of it was oxidized, but some of the oil was still unopened. If I ever ran out of oil, I could perform maintenance here without being seen. The further I went into the factory, the more the worries I had in the back of my mind were resolved. This abandoned factory should become an important place for me. But I can't find the thing I need most. That is, of course, the watch that Madd threw away in this place. But inside this factory, there isn't a single thing that even resembles garbage, let alone a watch. Could it be that the garbage was thrown outside instead of inside the factory? I decided to leave the factory for now and walk around its perimeter. Then, on the back side of the factory, I found an area piled high with machine parts. There were machine parts, of course, but also a lot of garbage. This must be the town's garbage dump.
Besides Madd, there must be others who have taken usable things home from here. Looking up at the mountain of garbage many times my height, I thought about that. …Now then, where could it be? There's a considerable amount of garbage. It would be difficult to find it by searching diligently. But there's no other way. I immediately started searching from my feet. I don't know how much time passed. I had long since lost my sense of time. My hands were covered in grime from moving muddy metal plates and containers full of waste oil. My clothes were covered in oil, and before I knew it, there were a lot of stains on them. Even after that, I crossed carpets of garbage, swam through rivers of filth, and was battered by waterfalls of scrap. And then, I finally found it. It was in Madd's shop. The one I broke yesterday. That watch. I picked it up and stared intently at the hands on the face. Of course, it wasn't moving. I put it to my ear, but it didn't make a sound. It's only natural, since I broke it.
This watch will probably never tick again. That fact pricked something deep inside my chest. Gently, I hugged the watch and decided to head home. Shiona greeted me with a gentle smile. "I'm home. I found it." As I held out the oil-stained trophy, Shiona smiled softly. "Really? Thank you. Here, go change, go change." Shiona had prepared a towel and a change of clothes for me. After wiping off the dirt and changing, I headed to the living room. Shiona greeted me there as well. "Rei, you look tired. Eat something and rest." "No, I'm okay. I want to get to work right away." "Are you okay? I'm worried about you." "I'm fine. Strangely, I don't feel tired right now." "But, you have to eat..." "Yeah, I know. I'll eat later, so you go ahead." "... Okay, I understand. Good luck." Shiona left the living room. I watched her go, and then I started working. I opened the book I borrowed from the library beside me.
This music box works by turning a handle, which causes various gears of different sizes inside to intricately mesh together, rotating the disc at a constant speed. Apparently, turning it faster doesn't make the song play faster. I thought that was a pretty amazing piece of technology. Following the assembly instructions written in the book in reverse order, I began to disassemble the music box. Then, as I compared each part to the diagrams, I found that a gear in the power transmission section was cracked. So, even with something that moves with such precision, it only takes one small part to fail for the whole thing to stop working. I couldn't help but look at my own right hand. For now, I'll try to find a gear of the same size as this broken one from the watch. I then started to disassemble the watch. I removed the lid and used a screwdriver to remove the screws. When I removed the cover, the internal structure was revealed. Gears much more precise than those in the music box meshed together in multiple layers. One of them, a slightly larger gear, had a broken axle. That's why the parts weren't turning. This must be the part I broke yesterday. The fact that Madd threw this watch away probably means he didn't have a gear of the same size. Fortunately, the broken gear wasn't the size needed for the music box. Taking things apart is somehow unsettling. I'm destroying this watch to fix the music box, after all. Perhaps it's because I understand what kind of existence I am myself. Hesitantly, but as a small offering, I disassembled the watch as carefully as possible.
I lined up the gears from the watch on the table, from smallest to largest, and compared them to those of the music box. …Found it. I managed to find a gear that seems to be almost the same size. Now, all that's left is to transplant this into the music box according to the book. I think this should work… With this, the disc should move without any problems. I put the lid back on and turned the handle, and I felt some resistance. But the handle won't turn any further. I wonder why. I reread the book. The parts and the positions where they are installed are correct. Tilting my head, I removed the lid again. And then, I tried turning the handle as it was. Certainly, the gears meshed together perfectly. But it seems the oil has completely dried up because it hasn't been used for a while. That must be the reason why the handle won't turn. What should I do? Should I go ask Shiona to borrow some cooking oil? …No, that's a problem too. Cooking oil and gear lubricant are probably different types.
It might work at first, but it could cause a breakdown. If that's the case, what should I do…? Suddenly, I looked at my right hand. Although it's covered by a glove, there are exposed mechanical parts underneath. What about using the oil used in my hand? I removed the glove and carefully examined my right hand. Exposed mechanical components. Oil is incorporated inside to smoothly move those parts. I inserted a screwdriver into the palm near the base of my thumb. When I removed the outer casing, it was packed with mechanisms like wiring, cylinders, and shafts to move the mechanical hand. One of the cylinders inside contained oil. And it was detachable so that the old oil could be easily replaced. I removed the cylinder with my left hand and dripped the oil that filled it onto the gears of the music box. I spread the oil with my fingertip so that it would blend into all the gears as much as possible. I wonder if this will work? I returned the cylinder to my right hand and reattached the outer casing. Hiding the mechanical arm with the glove, I tentatively turned the handle. At first, it was stiff. But as I turned the handle, the gears ran more smoothly. The oil must have circulated through all the gaps in the gears, because the handle continued to turn without any snagging. And then, that melody began to play.
"Rei, that song...!" Shiona suddenly came into the room. "Yeah. I fixed it, Shiona." "Thank you... thank you, Rei. Thank you... I'm so, so happy." Shiona showed me a smile I had never seen before. Just looking at that smile, my heart warms from the bottom up. And then, I realized. Ah, so this is it. This is the emotion called happiness. I am happy now. I am happy to see Shiona's smile. And, for the first time, I was able to feel a sense of being useful. "Thank you, Rei, thank you." Shiona took my hand and thanked me many times. As her face drew closer, I felt my face getting hot. "Thanks to your hard work, Rei, the music box is fixed. I can listen to that song again, the one I had given up on. The orange-colored song that my brother made. My favorite song..." "Hey, Shiona, sing it. Let me hear your brother's song." "Yes... of course!" I turn the handle of the music box. Shiona clasped her hands in front of her chest and began to sing along with the melody.
The song she was singing when we first met. A song Shiona's brother made. An orange-colored song. Now, I feel like I understand its meaning. The emotion dwelling in my heart is joy. Shiona's song. And Shiona, singing so happily. Just watching her, I was filled with joy. More than ever, Shiona seemed so happy as she sang that song. That day, Shiona kept singing until she fell asleep. I was also captivated by her singing voice and the melody. Again and again, Shiona asked me to play the song. Shiona kept singing until my arm could no longer move. Looking at her expression, I think. I want to be with Shiona like this forever. If Shiona wishes it, I can be with her forever. But for that to happen, my true identity must never be revealed. Never, absolutely never… That day, I solidified my resolve to stay with Shiona forever. Night. The room darkened.
On the two beds placed side by side, Shiona speaks to me. "Will you listen to my request?" "You see, I want many people to hear this song. And I want to make them smile. I want to make many people happy with this song that my brother made." I only know the word. But I didn't know what it was. Is it a state? Or is it an emotion? I repeated the word 'happiness' over and over in my head. "So, I want you to help me." "Help? What should I do?" "Tomorrow, I want you to go to the plaza with me. And I want you to turn the music box." "And then, Shiona will sing, right?" "Yes, that's right. And I want as many people as possible to hear it. That orange-colored song that my brother made..." "Yeah, I want to do that too. Of course, I'll help." I heard the rustling of sheets. "What's wrong, Shiona?" "Hey, Rei... can I hold your hand?" I can't see Shiona's expression in the darkness. But I felt like Shiona's face was turning red. "Hand? With me?"
"Yes, I want to hold hands with you, Rei... Is that... not okay...?" I search through my knowledge banks. I know the act of holding hands. But what it means for a boy and girl of her age... I don't know. "No, it's okay..." If a human... if Shiona is asking me, then I want to respond. Fortunately, she's on my left side. If it's the hand covered in artificial skin, I think it'll be alright. I reach my hand over to the bed next to mine. In the cold room, my outstretched hand felt a little chilly. I search for Shiona's hand in the air. Touching... warmth. Shiona's hand overlapped with mine. "You're warm, Rei." "Yes... I'm warm, Shiona." We held hands. Without either of us saying anything, our fingers intertwined. It wasn't just the warmth coming from our hands, a different kind of warmth spread through me. Is this the warmth of a human, different from my artificial warmth...? "Rei... tighter."
"... Like this...?" "Sorry, was that too tight?" "No... it was just stronger than I expected." "Is this strength okay?" "Yeah... thank you, Rei." We held hands all night long. Until the morning awakened us, our hands remained clasped together. The next day, the plaza was filled with sounds. The melody that Shiona and I began to play. Shiona sang. And I turned the music box that Shiona's brother made. At first, there were no passersby. But as if drawn by Shiona's singing voice, their numbers increased. One person, then two, stopped, and soon a small circle formed. That circle quickly grew larger, and the deserted plaza was soon bustling with activity. Everyone there was captivated by Shiona's singing. A young couple snuggled close, each holding the other's hand. An old man closed his eyes with deep emotion. A young man gazed at a woman standing a little distance away. A young parent and child laughed joyfully together.
The children were moving their bodies to the rhythm of the song. Each person listened to Shiona's song with their own thoughts and feelings. But there was one thing they all had in common. And that was that everyone was smiling. Listening to Shiona's song, everyone was beaming. Feeling that I was helping to bring smiles to the faces of the people here, I felt a warmth deep inside my chest. This is the emotion of happiness. The feeling I felt yesterday when I saw Shiona's smile. This is what it was. I am happy. I felt my cheeks lift slightly. Surely, I must be smiling too. It might be a slightly awkward-looking smile. But that's okay. If I could get even a little closer to Shiona, I would be satisfied. The music box, which I had just repaired, continued to play the melody flawlessly. The handle turns smoothly. The sound flowing from the disc reverberates inside the wooden box, amplifying and transforming into a clear tone that goes out into the world. According to Shiona, it's an orange-colored melody. And Shiona sings along to that melody.
