──The air stirred.
The pale blue light that had been surrounding me began to recede.
What came into view was a grimy ceiling.
My right arm, extended towards it, was slightly different from my left arm, also extended.
From the wrist down, my right arm was made of exposed mechanical parts.
My fingers moved smoothly, but each movement produced a faint metallic scraping sound.
Next, I slowly sat up.
That's when I realized the pale blue light I had been seeing was an oval-shaped lid with a gentle curve.
It seems I had been sleeping inside this capsule-like object.
Where is this place?
Who am I?
Why am I here?
I asked myself, but found no answers.
Even trying to recall my memories, all I had was the memory of the pale blue light.
To search for clues to my memory, I decided to get out of the capsule and walk around the room.
Although I knew how to walk, perhaps it had been a long time since I had, as my steps were unsteady.
Paying attention not to fall, I slowly moved forward.
The air hanging in the room was lukewarm, and each breath I took filled my throat with dust.
Light streamed in from a hole in the ceiling, revealing dust particles in the air along its path.
It's likely no one has entered this building for a very long time.
A thin layer of dust spread across the floor.
What is this place used for, I wonder?
Innumerable oval capsules were scattered throughout the large room.
Most of them were open.
The insides were empty.
Even if some were closed, there was nothing inside.
It seems I'm the only one in this room.
...No, to be precise, that's not quite right.
There are people present, leaning against the oval objects or lying on the floor.
But, no, that's wrong.
Those aren't exactly people, if I'm being precise.
It would be more accurate to call them humanoid objects.
Those humanoid objects had mechanical parts peeking out from under their skin.
Some had mechanical parts from the neck up.
Some had exposed mechanical arms.
Some had their lower bodies torn off, revealing mechanical parts.
And then, I remembered what those humanoid objects were.
Partners for humans, created for the sake of humans.
The closest existence to humans, equipped with not only the five senses but also emotions.
I reached out my hand to a Philoid that had ceased functioning.
The hand, with its exposed parts not covered by skin, bore a striking resemblance to my own right hand.
This is a factory.
I was created here.
...It's just that the facility was likely abandoned for some reason just before completion.
Gazing at the mechanical right hand before it was covered with artificial skin, I arrived at the most probable conclusion.
Having grasped the nature of my own existence, I began to walk towards the wall.
There stood an old automatic door, and right beside it, an LCD panel displaying "CLOSE" lay covered in dust.
I reached out and touched it with my mechanical hand.
The moment I felt something cold, like electricity, at my bloodless fingertips, it displayed "OPEN" and the door slid open.
Could I get outside from here, I wonder?
Is there anyone left in this facility?
I wanted to meet someone.
I wanted to meet a human.
Let's go find them, my partner.
I pushed open the door that led outside.
In order to prove my own existence.
Upon returning home, I headed straight for the living room.
There, I found the broken music box.
I opened a book I had borrowed from the library and began to study its structure.
Just as I suspected, the gears inside were chipped.
That's why no matter how much I turn the handle, the disc won't spin and no sound will play.
...But what should I do about this gear?
Would it be possible to make it to match the size written in the book? No, it's impossible.
With no answer coming to mind, I continued turning the pages of the book.
At the end of the book, there was a list of products for each manufacturer and a list of parts used.
As I skimmed through it, my gaze caught on something.
What I learned there was that the manufacturer that made this music box also made clocks.
If that's the case, the precise parts might be the same as those used in clocks.
Suddenly, I remembered what I broke at Mr. Mad's shop.
That clock... if they're going to throw it away because it's unusable...
If I use the gears and other parts from the clock, I might be able to fix the music box.
"Rei, what are you doing?"
Just as I saw the possibility of a repair, Shiona came into the living room.
"Shiona, listen. I might be able to fix the music box with the parts from the clock that was at Mr. Mad's shop."
"Really? Is that true?"
Shiona had an even more joyful smile than usual.
From that expression, I could tell how happy Shiona was.
"But don't push yourself, okay? We can still sing even without the music box."
Shiona picked up the music box and started singing.
That song she sang in the chapel.
That song, somehow nostalgic.
That song, that warms the depths of my heart.
As Shiona gazes lovingly at the music box, my resolve grows even stronger.
I want to fix this music box for her.
And I want to make Shiona happy.
That feeling swells up inside me.
"I'll go to Mad's shop again tomorrow."
I'll try to ask him if he can somehow let me have the clock.
But there was just one thing that bothered me.
That was the fact that I was the one who broke that clock.
I did apologize, but it's still hard to go there.
The thought of Mad yelling at me again is terrifying.
"You know, Onii-chan, I want to make lots of people smile with this song."
Shiona's words reached me as I hesitated.
"This song is orange... I'm sure it can turn many people's hearts orange. Because it's a song that was created with the wish that it would. Because that's Onii-chan's wish. That's why I want many people to hear this song. And I want to make many people smile. That's my wish."
Shiona said, as if talking to herself.
Those words gave me the push I needed.
I'll go to Mad's shop again tomorrow.
And I'll apologize again for breaking the clock.
Shiona's singing voice and the music box solidified my resolve.
The next day, I visited Mr. Mad's shop alone.
I can't count how many times I thought about turning back on the way.
Each time I thought that, Shiona's smile would come to mind.
I want to keep seeing that smile.
To do that, I want to fix the music box for her.
I recalled yesterday's resolve many times.
What I can do for Shiona.
I steeled myself and stepped into Mr. Mad's shop.
"You, what nerve do you have showing your face here?"
Immediately after, Mr. Mad's voice, as low as distant thunder, rained down.
I immediately wanted to run away, but I didn't.
"I wanted to apologize more properly for yesterday."
"About the clock? You already apologized for that."
"Shiona was there at the time... I thought I should apologize properly, by myself."
"I don't need that. Get lost."
"I can't do that. I'm truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday."
"No matter how much you apologize, the clock is still broken. Leave."
"I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry."
With my head bowed, I continued to apologize.
I wonder how much time had passed.
Eventually, Mr. Mad's slightly gentler voice reached me.
...Raise your head.
Doing as I was told, Mr. Mad's face, looking somewhat exasperated, was there.
Good grief... what a guy. You're unbelievably persistent.
I'm sorry...
Don't apologize again, or I'll knock you out!
He said that, but he didn't seem as angry as he was yesterday.
I thought I heard the sound of a small sigh.
You're done with your business, right? Get out of here quickly.
Um... there's just one thing I wanted to ask.
A request? You've got some nerve asking me for a favor.
My legs trembled from the pressure, but Shiona's words pushed me forward.
That clock... could you let me have it?
...Say that again.
Um... that clock from yesterday, could you let me have--
ARE YOU KIDDING MEEEEEEEEEE!!!
The impact was like being struck by lightning, and I froze stiffly at attention.
You broke it yourself and now you want me to give it to you? Don't get ahead of yourself!
It's no good...
I can't take any more than this...
As I tried to run away, a voice called out from behind me.
"Please wait, Mr. Mad. Rei just wants to fix my brother's music box."
There stood Shiona, who should have been waiting at home.
Shiona, without being intimidated by Mr. Mad, stepped between him and me.
"My brother's music box is broken, and Rei said he would fix it for me. He just needs parts for that. He's truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday. So, won't you please forgive him?"
Shiona conveyed this to Mr. Mad with an unwavering smile.
"Hmm... Hmmm..."
Mr. Mad's face was bright red, but his expression gradually softened.
"But, that clock is gone now. I threw that kind of thing away. However..."
Mr. Mad turned his back to us, but continued to speak.
"I threw it away at the abandoned factory on the outskirts of town. I don't know what happened after that."
After saying just that, Mr. Mad sat down facing the wall.
"Thank you, Mr. Mad."
Shiona bowed without losing her smile and left the store.
"Ah, thank you very much..."
I bowed in the same way and left the store.
"The abandoned factory is very close to where Rei collapsed."
As soon as we left the store, Shiona told me.
"So, Shiona, you're saying you go there to throw away trash?"
"That's right. Trash from various places gathers there."
"Could it be that you fix things you pick up from there and sell them here?"
"That's right. Mad often goes to that place."
I see, that's why there were so many old things in the store.
He must be bringing usable things from that place and reusing them.
In any case, I decided to head to that abandoned factory.
"Shiona, if you don't mind, I'd like you to guide me to that place."
"I'm sorry, the Red Children are coming to my house today."
She must be talking about those kids who were talking to Shiona yesterday.
Come to think of it, I promised to treat them to soup.
"But Rei, you can't go alone, right? I'll go and cancel my promise with the children."
"No, it's okay, Shiona. You should keep your promise."
"But, how are you going to get there?"
"I'll try going to the library. I want to know more about this area, and I want to look at a map."
"The library..."
Shiona's expression seemed to cloud over slightly.
"Eh... No, it's nothing... Hey, Rei. Is Tippy-chan attached to Rei?"
"I wonder. I don't think she dislikes me, but why do you ask?"
"No, it's nothing. If it's the library, I'm sure there's a map. Have a good trip."
"Yeah, I'll do that. Well then, see you later."
I turned on my heel and headed towards the library.
The smile I saw on Shiona's face at that moment seemed to me to hold a hint of sadness.
But I don't know the reason why.
"Rei, you came."
Tippy was in the same spot as yesterday, shedding tears just like before.
"Yeah, I came. Hey Tippy, can I ask you something?"
"Does this library have a map of the town?"
"Yeah, it does. It has lots."
"That's good. Will you show me where the maps are?"
"I don't mind... but..."
Tippy seemed somehow hesitant.
"No, that's not it... that's not it, but..."
"Will you hold me?"
Tippy's face turned slightly red.
Her sad expression hadn't changed, but her cheeks seemed a little softer.
"...Hold you? Hold you, like we did yesterday?"
"Yeah... is that okay?"
"It's okay. Here, come here."
"Yeah... yeah..."
When I opened my arms, Tippy stood up and, somewhat hesitantly, jumped into my chest.
Unlike yesterday, this time I was holding her.
But my feelings are the same.
The Tippy I held was still small, soft, and felt like she might break.
"Tippy, is this okay?"
"Yeah, it's okay. Rei... you're warm."
Tippy nuzzled against my chest.
That gesture warmed the depths of my heart.
Could this be the feeling of endearment?
I want to protect this girl.
I want to stop these tears.
For a while, I held Tippy close.
"Um, can you walk over there just like this?"
Tippy pointed her finger towards the aisle from within my embrace.
Still holding her, I headed in the direction she indicated with her finger.
"Why do you need a map?"
"Apparently, there's an abandoned factory near the town. I want to go there."
"Why, to the abandoned factory?"
"Because, the parts I'm looking for might be there."
"For the music box you were looking at yesterday?"
"Yeah, that's right. I really want to fix Shiona's brother's music box for her."
"Shiona's... I see. I hope you find it."
Still held in my arms, Tippy unerringly led me to the bookshelf where the map books were kept.
"Do you perhaps remember where each book is?"
"Yeah, pretty much."
"That's amazing... Did someone teach you?"
"Uh-uh. I learned by myself while waiting for Papa and Mama."
Upon mentioning "Papa and Mama," Tippy became a little teary-eyed.
"Um... is it this one?"
To change the subject, I took out a map book.
I sat down right there and opened the book.
Like the music box book, this map was also handwritten.
Could it be that all the books in this library are handwritten?
If so, that's a considerable amount.
Just who could have handwritten this many books?
The task, requiring an endless amount of time, made me feel faint.
"It's pretty beat up... How old is this book?"
"Um... I don't know. It's a really, really, reeeeally old book."
It seemed like a map from decades ago.
The buildings themselves seem the same as the current townscape, though...
The pages were severely faded, as if tea had been spilled on them.
Some were stuck together, and looked like they would tear if I tried to turn them.
I carefully turned the pages.
"Ah, could this be it?"
I found a factory symbol on the map to the north of town.
Considering the direction of Shiona's house, it's highly likely this is the place.
"Rei... are you leaving? Don't go..."
Tippy clung to my neck.
I stroked her small back with my hand, over and over.
"It's okay, I'll come back."
"Really? Will you really come back?"
"Yeah, of course. I promise."
"You promise? You absolutely, absolutely have to come back!"
"Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely."
Again and again, I exchanged promises with Tippy.
Why is that?
Even so, I felt reluctant to leave the place.
A feeling of wanting to stay by Tippy's side forever was welling up inside me.
Hiding that feeling, I left the library.
Entering the abandoned factory I reached using the map, the smell of oxidized oil stung my nose.
This factory, too, must have originally been making Philoid arms and legs.
All around, unfinished Philoid arm and leg parts were scattered everywhere.
All of them are before being covered with artificial skin, with the machine parts exposed.
Looking closely, I can see that they are made the same way as my right hand.
Even knowing they are artificial, this sight was bizarre.
To move a rolling arm out of the way, I pushed it aside with my right hand.
The lonely sound of metal colliding echoed through the factory.
If some part of my body breaks by chance, I'll come here.
Here, there are mountains of replacement parts.
In the back, there were many drums filled with oxidized oil rolling around.
Most of it has oxidized, but some of it was unopened.
Even if I run out of oil, I can perform maintenance here without being seen.
The further I went into the factory, the more the worries I had in the back of my mind were resolved.
This abandoned factory should become an important place for me.
But, I can't find the most important thing.
That is, of course, the watch that Mad discarded in this place.
But, inside this factory, there isn't even anything that looks like trash, let alone a watch.
Could it be that the garbage was thrown outside, not inside the factory?
I left the factory for a while and decided to go around its perimeter.
Then, on the back side of the factory, I was able to find an area where machine parts were piled high.
There are machine parts, of course, but also a lot of garbage is thrown away.
Surely this town's garbage dump is here.
Besides Mad, there must be others who take things that might be useful from here.
Looking up at the mountain that was many times my height, I thought about that.
"......Now, where could it be?"
There's a considerable amount of garbage.
It would be a lot of work to search diligently and find it.
But, there's no other way.
I immediately decided to start searching from my feet.
I don't know how much time had passed.
I lost my sense of time a long time ago.
Because I was moving muddy metal plates and containers covered in waste oil, my hands were filthy.
Oil was stuck all over my clothes, and before I knew it, there were a lot of stains.
Even after that, I crossed a carpet of garbage, swam in a river of filth, and was hit by a waterfall of scrap.
And then, I finally found it.
It was in Mad's shop.
The one I broke yesterday.
That watch.
I picked it up and stared intently at the hands on the dial.
Of course, it wasn't moving.
I put it to my ear, but it didn't make any sound.
It's only natural, since I broke it.
This clock will probably never tick again.
That fact pricked slightly at the depths of my chest.
Gently, I hugged the clock and decided to head home.
Shiona greeted me kindly.
"I'm home. I found it."
When I held out the oil-stained prize, Shiona smiled gently.
"Really, thank you. Here, go change, go change."
Shiona had prepared a towel and a change of clothes for me.
After wiping off the dirt and finishing changing, I headed to the living room.
Shiona greeted me there as well.
"Ray, you must be tired, right? Eat and rest."
"No, I'm okay. I want to get to work right away."
"Are you okay? I'm worried about your body, Ray."
"I'm fine. Strangely, I don't feel tired right now."
"But, you have to eat..."
"Yeah, I know. I'll eat later, so go ahead and eat first."
"...Okay, I understand. Good luck."
Shiona left the living room.
After watching her go, I started working.
I opened the book I borrowed from the library beside me.
This music box has a mechanism inside where gears of various sizes intricately mesh together when the handle is turned, causing the disc to rotate at a constant speed.
Apparently, turning it faster doesn't make the song play faster.
I thought that was truly amazing technology.
Following the assembly instructions written in the book in reverse order, I disassembled the music box.
Then, as I checked the parts one by one in order, I found that a gear in the power transmission section was broken.
So, even with something that moves with such precision, it only takes one small part to fail for it to stop working.
I couldn't help but look at my own right hand.
For now, I'll try to find a gear the same size as this broken one from the watch.
I then started disassembling the watch.
I removed the lid and used a screwdriver to remove the screws.
When I removed the cover, the internal structure was revealed.
Gears much more precise than those in the music box were meshed together in multiple layers.
One of them, a slightly larger gear, had a broken axle. That's why the parts weren't turning.
I guess this is the place I broke yesterday.
The fact that Mad discarded this watch probably means he didn't have a gear of the same size.
Fortunately, the broken gear wasn't the size needed for the music box.
Disassembling things makes me feel somewhat hesitant.
Because I'm breaking this watch to fix the music box.
Perhaps it's because I understand for myself what kind of existence I am.
Hesitantly, but as a small offering, I disassembled the watch as carefully as possible.
I lined up the watch gears on the table, starting with the smallest, and compared them to the music box gears.
...Found it.
I was able to find a gear that seemed to be almost exactly the same size.
Now, all that's left is to transplant this into the music box according to the book.
"I think this should be okay..."
With this, the disc should move without any issues.
I put the lid back on and turned the handle, and I felt some resistance.
But the handle wouldn't turn any further.
Why is that?
I reread the book.
There are no problems with the parts or where they're installed.
Tilting my head, I removed the lid again.
Then, I tried turning the handle just as it was.
The gears were certainly meshing perfectly.
But it seems the oil has completely dried up because it hasn't been used for a while.
That must be the reason the handle won't turn.
What should I do?
Should I go to Shiona's place and borrow some cooking oil?
...No, that's also a problem.
Cooking oil and gear lubricant are probably different types of oil.
It might work at first, but it could cause a malfunction.
If that's the case, what should I do...?
Suddenly, I looked at my right hand.
Although covered by a glove, underneath were exposed mechanical parts.
How about using the oil used in my hand?
I took off my glove and looked closely at my right hand.
The exposed mechanical parts.
Oil is built inside to make those parts move smoothly.
I inserted a screwdriver into the palm of my hand near the base of my thumb.
When I removed the exterior, I saw that the inside was densely packed with mechanisms like wiring, cylinders, and shafts to move the mechanical hand.
One of the cylinders inside contained oil.
And it was detachable so that the old oil could be easily replaced.
I removed the cylinder with my left hand and dripped the oil that filled it onto the music box's gears.
I spread the oil with my fingertip to help it blend into all the gears as much as possible.
I wonder if it will work?
I returned the cylinder to my right hand and reattached the exterior.
I hid the mechanical arm with a glove, and then cautiously tried turning the handle.
At first, it was stiff. But as I turned the handle, the gears ran smoothly.
The oil must have circulated through the gaps of all the gears, as the handle continued to turn without any resistance.
And then, that melody began to play.
"Rei, that song...!"
Shiona suddenly burst into the room.
"Yeah. It's fixed, Shiona."
"Thank you... thank you, Rei. Thank you... I'm so, so happy."
Shiona showed me a smile I had never seen before.
Just looking at that smile made the depths of my chest feel gently warm.
And then, I realized.
Ah, so this is it.
This is the emotion called happiness.
I am happy now.
I am happy seeing Shiona's smile.
And, for the first time, I was able to feel truly useful.
"Thank you, Rei, thank you."
Shiona took my hand and thanked me over and over.
As her face drew closer, I felt my face grow hot.
"Thanks to Rei's hard work, the music box is fixed. I can listen to that song again, which I had given up on. This orange-colored song that my brother made. This song that I love so much..."
"Hey, Shiona, sing it. Let me hear your brother's song."
"Yes... of course!"
I turn the handle of the music box.
Shiona clasped her hands in front of her chest and began to sing along with the melody.
The song she was singing when we first met.
The song Shiona's brother made.
An orange-colored song.
I felt like I finally understood its meaning now.
The emotion residing in my chest is joy.
Shiona's song.
And Shiona, singing so happily.
Just watching her, joy overflowed from within me.
More than usual, Shiona sang that song with such happiness.
That day, Shiona kept singing until she fell asleep.
I, too, was captivated by her singing voice and the melody.
Over and over, Shiona asked me to play the song.
Shiona kept singing until my arm could no longer move.
Looking at her expression, I thought.
I want to stay with Shiona like this forever.
If Shiona wishes for it, I can stay with her forever.
But for that to happen, my true identity must never be exposed.
Never, absolutely never...
That day, I solidified my resolve to always be with Shiona.
Night fell, and the room grew dark.
Lying on the two beds side-by-side, Shiona speaks to me.
"Will you grant my wish?"
"You see, I want lots of people to hear this song. And I want to make them smile. I want to make lots of people happy with this song you made, big brother."
I only know the word.
But I didn't understand what it was.
Is it a state?
Or is it an emotion?
I repeat the word 'happiness' over and over in my head.
"And so, I want you to help me."
"Help? How can I help?"
"Tomorrow, I want you to go to the plaza with me. And I want you to wind the music box."
"And then, Shiona will sing, right?"
"Yes, that's right. And I want as many people as possible to hear it. That orange-colored song that you made, big brother..."
"Yeah, I want to do that too. Of course, I'll help."
I heard the sound of the sheets rustling.
"What's wrong, Shiona?"
"Hey, Rei... can we hold hands?"
I can't see Shiona's expression in the darkness.
But I felt like Shiona's face was turning red.
"Hands? With me?"
"Yeah, I want to hold yours, Rei... Is that... not okay...?"
I search through my knowledge.
I know the act of holding hands.
But what it means for a boy and girl of a certain age...
"No, it's fine..."
If a human... if Shiona needs me, then I want to respond.
Fortunately, she's on my left.
If it's the hand covered in artificial skin, I don't think there'll be a problem.
I reach my hand out to the bed next to me.
In the cold room, my outstretched hand felt a little chilly.
I search for Shiona's hand in the air.
Touching, warmth.
Shiona's hand overlapped with mine.
"You're warm, Rei."
"Yeah... you're warm, Shiona."
We held hands.
Without either of us saying anything, we intertwined our fingers.
Not just warmth emitted from our hands, but warmth spread.
Is this the warmth of a human, different from my artificial warmth...?
"Rei... tighter."
"...Like this...?"
"Sorry, did that hurt?"
"No... it was just stronger than I expected."
"Is this pressure okay?"
"Yeah... thank you, Rei."
We held hands all night long.
Our hands remained clasped until the morning woke us.
The next day, the plaza was filled with sound.
The melody that Shiona and I began to play.
Shiona sang.
And I turned the crank of Shiona's older brother's music box.
At first, there were no passersby.
But as if drawn in by Shiona's singing voice, their numbers grew.
One by one, people stopped, and soon a small circle formed.
That circle quickly grew larger, and the deserted plaza was soon bustling with activity.
Everyone there was listening intently to Shiona's singing voice.
A young couple snuggled close, holding each other's hands.
An old man closed his eyes, deeply moved.
A young man gazed at a woman a little distance away.
A young parent and child laughed happily together.
The children were moving their bodies to the song.
Each of them was listening to Shiona's song with their own thoughts.
But there was one thing they all had in common.
That was that everyone was 'smiling'.
Listening to Shiona's song, everyone was beaming.
Feeling that I was now helping to bring smiles to the faces of the people here, I felt a warmth deep in my chest.
This is the feeling of happiness.
The feeling I felt yesterday when I saw Shiona's smile.
This is what it was.
I am happy.
I felt my cheeks lift slightly.
Surely, I must be smiling too.
It might be a slightly awkward-looking smile.
But that's okay.
If I can get even a little closer to Shiona, I'll be satisfied with just that.
The music box, which I had just repaired, continued to play the melody without a hitch.
The turning handle was also in good condition.
The sound flowing from the disc resonates and amplifies inside the wooden box, becoming a clear tone that goes outside.
According to Shiona, an orange-colored melody.
Shiona sings along with that melody.
