These feelings... how are they necessary for living?
Bitter... painful..., heavy, aching, and cold...
I look at Shiona's expression reflected in the mirror.
But she wore a somewhat sad, ephemeral smile.
I'm sure she's putting on a brave face.
Just thinking about that makes the depths of my chest ache.
"You care about Tippy-chan, too. But you know, I want you to value yourself first."
"Me... value myself?"
"Yes, that's right. I want Rei to value Rei himself."
"Value myself... I've never thought about that before."
"Rei, you're so kind. That's why I'm sure you prioritize others over yourself."
"But that's what I want to do."
"I'm a little sad about that. I don't want you to push yourself too hard."
"I'm not pushing myself."
"Is that so? I can't think that way."
Shiona's arms entwined with mine.
"...I'm worried, you know."
I could feel my heart rate increasing.
I don't know what it is.
But it was certainly stirring my emotions.
In that warmth, I felt kindness.
...No, more than kindness... I feel a different kind of warmth, different from what I feel on my skin.
Hey Rei, how about we have some tea?
......Tea? Why?
When you drink something warm and fuzzy, your heart feels fuzzy too. It relaxes your mind and body, and it feels really good.
But Tippy...
Tippy-chan is probably shaken by the death of that person. But you know, I'm sure she can overcome it. So let's just leave her alone for a little while. Being alone is very important, you know?
Is that so?
Yes, I'm sure it is. Because if you don't, you can't become strong.
People can become stronger by overcoming walls and sorrows. But if they are helped by someone every time, they cannot grow easily. To help Tippy-chan grow, let's leave her alone today, okay?
Tippy is a weak being.
She's always crying.
But, if you're saying it's a chance for her to grow...
I'll accept it.
Shiona, will you make some tea for me?
Of course. Will you sit in a chair and wait?
I sat on the sofa and waited for Shiona's tea.
After waiting for a while, a nice scent filled the room.
Sorry to keep you waiting. Here's a special, heartwarming tea. Enjoy.
The offered teacup was filled with an orange-colored drink.
A faint sourness and a subtle sweetness waft through the air.
Like this. It's been a while since I've had a chance to talk with you slowly, Rei.
Yeah, it has. A lot's happened...
Rei, how's your memory?
No, it doesn't seem like it's coming back yet.
I see... But, there's no need to rush. You might just suddenly remember something one of these days.
Yeah, thanks... But, you know, I feel bad.
Feel bad? About what?
I'm staying here as a freeloader, but I haven't been able to repay Shiona for her kindness at all.
That's not true. I'm just happy to have you by my side, Rei.
But that's not repaying you at all.
It's not just that. You fixed the music box too... Thanks to that, I can sing now.
You were singing even before that, Shiona.
But you know, it's very different with and without a melody. Remember when we performed together in the plaza? Actually, I sang in that place many times before.
In that place... alone?
Yeah. But you know, no one would listen to me back then.
Even with such a wonderful singing voice? That's strange.
Hehe, thank you. But you know, that's just how it is. So you know, I was so happy when you brought the music box with you, Rei.
That... I was just turning the music box.
That's what makes me happy. Being next to you, being with you, is what makes me happiest of all.
I feel the same way. I'm happy to be with you, Shiona.
......Hehe. Thank you. Rei, you've become so much more expressive.
Expressive? Me?
Yes. Your expressions are so much richer than when we first met.
That was what I sought, what I desired.
It was what I had been longing for ever since I woke up.
Being told that by Shiona fills my heart.
The incomplete me is getting closer to being human... closer to Shiona, or so she tells me.
I'm sure it's because you're always smiling next to me, Shiona.
Is that so? I haven't done anything.
No, it's because you're here, Shiona. Thank you, I'm grateful.
If you're going to say that, then so am I. Thank you, Rei.
I'm the one who should be thanking you.
I'm the one who... Hehe, this is funny. Us thanking each other over and over.
You're right. What are we even doing?
......But you know, it's strange.
What's strange?
I'm thinking that I wish this time could last forever... That's strange, isn't it?
......No, not at all. I was thinking the same thing...
......Can I come over there?
Shiona sits next to me.
A distance where I can feel her warmth.
We are closer than we've ever been before.
Huh...? What is this...?
What's wrong?
Something feels strange in my body. My chest... it's pounding.
Could it be that I've broken down? I'd be troubled if it's a major malfunction requiring maintenance.
It's okay. I feel the same way. My chest has been pounding the whole time.
Eh? A-Are you okay? Does it hurt?
Yeah. This is a wonderful thing.
Shiona gently smiles shyly as she places her hand on mine.
Softly, as if enveloping it.
Responding to that, I turn my wrist. As if to align our palms... as if to intertwine our fingers.
I feel Shiona's warmth even more strongly.
And that warmth warms the depths of my heart.
The depths of my heart are warm, like, gently...
Your heart...? Here...?
Shiona's hand reaches for my chest.
The place she touched instantly became hot.
Shiona's hand feels so hot... I wonder why. Could it be a disease?
No, that's not it.
Do you know the cause, Shiona?
Yes, probably.
Tell me.
Hehe, what should I do?
Don't be mean. I'm curious.
Hmm... but you know, it's not just you, Rei.
The getting hot part?
Yes, that's right. My heart is also very hot right now.
You feel the same, Shiona?
Yes, the same. Maybe I'm in even worse shape than you, Rei.
That's terrible! How can we fix it?
No, we can't fix it... we don't need to fix it.
My heart is hot, it's tight, it's painful, it's sad, but it's warm... and that's okay. That's good, Rei.
Shiona's hand, which is on top of mine, got a little hotter.
I squeeze her hand back.
Rei, please.
I want you to stay with me forever.
Yeah... will you stay with me forever and ever?
Yeah... I promise.
Thank you, Rei. I'm so happy... so, so...
Shiona rested her head on my chest.
I felt like my heart was being filled.
It's similar to the feeling of joy I felt before, but it's a much stronger emotion.
What do humans call this?
I wanted to ask Shiona, but I thought it would be impolite to break this atmosphere.
So, just like this... I'll entrust myself and Shiona to time.
The sweet-smelling tea prepared on the table. We stayed like that until the steam disappeared.
The next day, I was getting ready to go out after finishing breakfast.
Shiona, who was washing the dishes, called out to me.
I was thinking of going to the library.
The library... are you going to see Tippy-chan?
Yes, that's the plan.
I'm sure Tippy-chan is still in the process of overcoming it. So, shouldn't we leave her be?
Yeah... but if she can't overcome it and is feeling lonely all by herself, I can't just leave her alone.
Just like Shiona was by my side yesterday and made me feel warm, I think I can support her just by being near her.
It's okay. Tippy-chan isn't that weak.
Do you think so...?
Yeah, I'm sure of it. More importantly, Rei, I have a favor to ask. Won't you go to the plaza today?
To the plaza? Why?
I want to bring the music box... and sing again.
Yeah, something sad happened, right? So, it's important to rest your heart.
Rest my heart...?
We had a funeral, and I'm sure everyone in town is feeling down. So, don't you want to brighten everyone's spirits?
...Everyone in town? Of course, I do.
It's painful to see sad faces.
If I can, I want to heal that sadness.
That's what our melody can do. I'm sure it will help the town regain its energy.
I see... Do you think so?
Yeah, I'm sure of it. Come on, let's get ready.
Urged by Shiona, I reach for the music box.
The music box, which I maintain every day, is always ready to play music.
We set off for the plaza.
It was a cloudy afternoon.
There were hardly any people there.
There's no one here, Shiona.
It's always like this at this time. Before you came, Rei.
Before I came...?
I told you, didn't I? Ever since you started playing music, everyone has started listening to my songs. The people in town are slowly changing. They're going out more, and interacting more. I feel like the connections between people are gradually getting stronger.
Is it... because I came?
Yes, I think so. Ever since you came, Rei, the people in town have been changing. In a good way, of course.
That was a very welcome thing to hear.
I'm being useful to someone.
That fact fills me with joy.
You look happy, Rei.
Yeah. Your cheeks are all loose.
My cheeks?
Yeah, look --
Shiona's fingertip touches my cheek.
Just that alone makes me feel a warmth deep inside my chest again.
My face feels kind of hot.
Rei, are you blushing? Ahaha.
My face gets even hotter.
It seems like what Shiona is saying is right on the mark.
Well then, Rei, shall we begin?
Yeah, is your preparation okay?
Whenever you're ready.
Shiona slowly closes her eyes.
I felt like I could look at that beautiful profile forever.
But just as much, I also want to hear Shiona's singing voice.
And so, I slowly began to turn the music box's handle.
Shiona's singing voice joined the melody.
The two melodies intertwined, filling the area with a beautiful timbre.
Soon, people began to gather.
At first, the people had slightly gloomy faces, but gradually they began to smile again.
And before anyone knew it, a large circle of smiles had spread across the plaza.
Town Child A
Town Person A
Town Person B
Town Person C
Town Person D
The smiles and words of various people are flying around.
Ah, this is it.
This is what I was looking for.
People with happy smiles.
Each time I see those smiles, my joy intensifies.
I was saddened that that girl wasn't in the circle.
The blue-haired girl in the back of the library.
The girl who never comes here.
The girl who remains shut up in that library.
I couldn't stop thinking about that girl.
Shiona's voice snapped me back to reality.
"Sorry, I was just lost in thought."
"I see... everyone's already gone home, you know."
Looking around, the people who had been in such a large circle were now scattered.
It seemed I had been lost in thought for a very long time.
"What were you thinking about?"
"Hmm... no... it's nothing..."
"Shall I guess? It's about Tippy, isn't it?"
She saw right through me so easily. So I nodded honestly.
"...Yeah, it is."
"I knew it... are you really that worried about her?"
"Yeah, I'm worried. She's still such a little kid, after all."
"A little kid, huh... I guess so."
"And she's always all alone. There's no way she isn't lonely."
"But she's always been like that. She's used to it by now."
"That's not true."
"After all, you said it yourself, Shiona. That the townspeople have changed since I came."
"Yeah, that's true..."
"Then I want Tippy to change too. It's not right for her to stay lonely."
I repeated what Shiona had taught me, as if returning the favor.
Hearing those words, Shiona's smile clouded over slightly.
She looked towards the library, pursed her lips for a moment, and then turned back to me with a smile.
"Let's go home, Rei?"
"It's going to rain from noon today. Come on, let's go... okay? I'll make that fluffy white soup."
Taking Shiona's hand, I was more or less forcibly pulled away from the plaza.
Then, a few hours later.
Shiona called out to me again as I was about to leave the house.
"Um, I was thinking I'd like to read a book..."
"If it's books you want, my brother has a few he used to read."
"Not those... well, it's a genre of book that I'm sure isn't here."
"What kind of genre is it?"
"Books about machines. I've been interested ever since I fixed Mad's the other day."
"I see. I'm glad you're taking an interest in something, Rei."
"Yeah, thanks. So, I'm going to go to the library."
"Does it have to be today?"
"Yeah, sooner is better. I want to read it as soon as possible."
"But it's going to rain soon, you know?"
"The weather doesn't matter. I'll go even if it rains."
"But the books might get wet, you know?"
"It's okay, I'll take a bag with me."
"Hmm... then I'll go and borrow it for you."
"Huh? No, it's fine, I'll go myself."
"No, it's okay. I have some shopping to do anyway, so I'll go while I'm at it."
Saying that, Shiona returned to her room.
Why is that?
I feel like Shiona is trying to keep me away from the library.
No, that's not it.
It would probably be more accurate to say she's keeping me away from Tippy.
I don't know what that means, but it seems like she really doesn't want us to meet.
Shiona says it calmly, but I can feel her feelings.
But, why on earth?
"I'm ready, Rei. What kind of book should I borrow?"
"You probably wouldn't understand even if I told you, so I'll go with you."
"No, it's okay. You just relax, Rei."
"Then... I want you to borrow a book with electronic circuits in it."
"Electronic circuits, got it. Well then, I'm off."
Shiona went out.
I waited for several minutes.
It's probably about time Shiona is out of sight.
I reached for the door leading outside.
...That's strange.
It's not locked.
But the door wouldn't open no matter what I did.
It's as if it's bolted from the outside.
--Could it be, that's what's happening?
When Shiona left, she locked a lock that can only be locked from the outside, without me noticing.
That's why I can't get out of this door.
--But, why?
--For what purpose?
I returned to the living room, holding my head.
When I glanced at the table, there was a piece of paper that hadn't been there before.
It's a note from Shiona.
To Rei,
I think you were surprised that it was locked.
Do you remember me telling you that a nearby town was attacked?
So, I'm locking the door as a precaution.
Please stay put, okay?
I've prepared soup and bread for your meal.
Please heat it up and eat it.
Make sure you never go outside.
I've heard stories about humans who repeat plunder from that dead young man too.
Perhaps those humans are coming near here.
If that's the case, going outside is dangerous.
I see. Shiona was worried about me.
But, if that's the case, then it's dangerous for Shiona to go outside too.
Shouldn't I, as a man, have gone shopping instead?
--I can't deceive myself....
It's certainly true that there are humans who plunder.
Even so, is it necessary to lock the door from the outside?
Rather, if it's locked from the outside, then the key to open it can also be used from the outside.
Entry into the house becomes easier.
--That's strange.
If she was really wary of humans who plunder, she wouldn't have sung in the plaza yesterday.
She wouldn't do something that would intentionally gather people.
If that's the case, then why?
--There's only one thing I can think of.
She locked me in.
To keep me away from Tipi.
There's no way Shiona would do something like this without thinking.
There's definitely a reason.
And I'm sure it's something she's doing for my sake.
...Could something have happened to Tipi?
Is she trying to keep it from me?
Something that's not good for me... so I won't be sad knowing about it...
I couldn't sit still anymore.
I want to see Tipi. I want to make sure she's okay.
A blue-haired girl, crying alone in the library.
I wanted to wipe away that girl's tears.
I look around inside the church.
There was a window quite high up.
Even if I could climb up, there's no guarantee I could get outside and down safely.
But that's the only way to get out of here.
Suddenly, a white cloth caught my eye.
A curtain swaying in the wind.
There are several of them in the room, long, large, and sturdy-looking to cover the large windows.
I start taking down the curtains from all the windows.
There's no sign of sunlight pouring down from the sky, which is covered in dark clouds.
Tying the five curtains together on the table made them quite long.
It's long enough to reach down to the first floor.
I tie the end of the curtain to the window lattice.
I wrapped it around several times, checking the strength repeatedly.
It's okay.
It should be able to support my weight alone.
I tie the other end of the curtain to myself.
And with resolve, I leaned my body out of the window.
The ground visible from there looks very far away.
I feel a little faint, but I can't back down now.
Gripping the curtain tightly, I slowly lower my body.
Partway down, a strong gust of wind shook me.
As my body swung like a pendulum, I could barely manage to cling to the curtain.
I waited several minutes for the wind to die down.
I took one big, deep breath and resumed lowering my body.
It probably took a good ten minutes before my feet finally reached the ground.
My body was so exhausted that I almost collapsed onto my backside.
But I don't have time to rest here.
I started walking towards the library where the blue-haired girl is waiting.
As if to obstruct my feelings, rain quietly begins to fall.
As if to moisten the parched town, its intensity gradually increases.
Not caring about getting wet, I, without an umbrella, continue to walk forward.
The wet clothes clung to my skin, bringing me an unpleasant sensation.
I sheltered my right hand, covered by a glove, from the rain.
Puddles began to form at my feet, and distant thunder could be heard.
My rough breaths occasionally carried rainwater into my mouth.
In contrast to my hot body, cold rain lashed at me from the outside.
Spitting the rusty-tasting rain from my mouth, I finally arrived.
At the library where the blue-haired girl waits alone.
The inside is dimly lit, and no light leaks out at all.
Is she buried alone again in that dark sea of books?
Just thinking about it, my chest ached terribly.
I entered the entrance and proceeded deep inside, where the blue-haired girl was waiting.
"You came after all..."
A voice reached me from the depths.
It wasn't Tipi's.
It was the very person who kept me away from here--.
"I wrote in the note that it's dangerous outside, so you shouldn't go out, right? Or perhaps, you didn't see it?"
"No, I saw it."
"I see... So you knew and came anyway. Rei is a bad boy."
Fufu, Shiona's laughter could be heard.
But her expression wasn't clearly visible in the dimly lit hall.
"Why did you lock me up?"
"Lock you up...? Well, I guess that's how it turned out. I'm sorry."
"There's a reason, isn't there? Would you mind telling me if you're okay with it?"
"...Reason? The reason is simple. I don't want you to see her."
"You don't want me to see her...?"
"The blue-haired girl up ahead."
"Tipi? Why?"
"I can't tell you that. It's top secret."
"Wait, I don't understand what you're saying. Why can't I see Tipi?"
"That's... because it's not allowed."
"That's not a reason! Tell me properly."
"I can't tell you the reason."
I couldn't help but raise my voice.
At the same time, I realized that my chest was burning red and hot.
Is this "anger?"
Am I feeling anger towards Shiona...?
I don't mean to. I just want her to tell me the truth.
But my words just now seemed to have upset Shiona.
I can't see her expression clearly in the darkness, but the atmosphere coming from her has changed.
An air of hesitation, as if she's struggling to say something.
Shiona opened her mouth slightly, as if to say something... but then closed it again.
Then, tilting her chin down as if to look down, she whispered the words.
"...Because it will lead to unhappiness."
"Unhappiness? Who?"
"...Ray, me... and everyone living in this town, I guess."
"The people in town? Because we meet? I don't know what you're talking about."
"Certainly, you may not understand now. But I'm sure you'll regret it later."
"Why would I regret it? Hey, Shiona, tell me clearly. I'm not very smart, so I don't understand. Unless you tell me clearly..."
"In other words, it's like this..."
The sound of boots.
In the dimly lit entrance, Shiona approaches me.
The next moment, I felt warmth.
And, softness.
Shiona was hugging me.
"Shiona... eh? W-what..."
"Please, Ray... won't you just go home with me like this?"
"Like this...? What do you mean?"
"It's really not good for Ray and Tipi to meet. To be precise, if you meet, a chain of bad things will happen. So..."
"Could it be that I made Tipi angry? Is that why she doesn't want to see me, or something like that?"
"No, it's the opposite. Tipi loves Ray very much."
"Then--"
"That's why, we can't meet. Please, understand."
The arms Shiona had wrapped around my waist tightened.
A sweet fragrance enveloped my entire body, making my head spin.
"...Is that, Shiona's wish?"
"Yes, it is. It's my heartfelt wish."
"If I were to meet Tipi, what would Shiona think?"
"I would be very, very sad. I think I would feel blue and prickly."
"Why? Why does Shiona feel that way?"
Shiona pulled her face away from me and looked up at me with upturned eyes...
She said, as if she had made up her mind.
"Ray... because I love you."
"L-love...?"
Those words nearly made my mind grind to a halt.
Sweet breath.
Lips that seemed about to touch.
Hands around my waist.
The warmth of our bodies touching.
We were as close as we could possibly be.
And, those words just now.
It was just a word formed by connecting two simple characters, yet it was filled with such deep emotion.
These words were filling my heart with incredible force.
I was feeling an unprecedented level of 'joy'.
To be needed by someone. To have a certain someone pour a certain amount of affection into you.
I know no greater joy than this.
And now, I am about to obtain that joy.
I put my limp arms around Shiona's back.
Shiona accepts it.
A warmth grows deep within my chest.
"Shiona, I..."
"Yes, Ray. I understand. That's why, let's go home..."
Shiona's hand is linked with mine.
I turned on my heel and started walking towards the library exit.
"...Thank you, Ray. But you know, this is for the best. Because this is for your sake."
I felt a sense of unease at Shiona's words.
Shiona called out to me, looking puzzled, as I suddenly stopped walking.
"Shiona, you just said, 'for my sake,' right?"
"Yes, I certainly did say that."
"No, Shiona, that's not right."
"Not right? What's not right, Ray?"
"If you're saying it's for my sake, then this isn't right."
"It's not wrong. Doing this is for your sake, Ray."
"It is wrong. Because, I'm happy when I can be of use to someone. I'm here to be of use to someone. But now, I'm trying to disappear from the person I can be of use to. That's not my joy, and it's not for my sake. So, who is this for, then?"
"Shiona, I'm going to Tipi's place. It's for no one else, it's for myself. If someone ends up unhappy because of this, then it's my fault. But, even if that's how it turns out, I won't stop. Because that's the result I wanted."
I released Shiona's hand, and once again pushed forward through the entrance.
Shiona's voice didn't reach my back.
Shiona just stared silently, without saying a word, with a sad expression as she watched me.
I passed through the rain-scented entrance and moved deeper into the library.
I could feel the moisture on the soles of my shoes being absorbed into the carpet with each step.
The dry library air clung to my wet skin.
I continued to feel inexplicably unwell.
That might be related to what happened with Shiona just now.
The depths of my chest ached, as if I had swallowed something heavy.
Shiona's face flashed through my mind again and again.
Every one of them, wearing a sad smile.
Why did things turn out this way?
Why did I do such a thing?
A wave of regret washed over me.
But, I couldn't stop walking.
--That girl is further in.
A girl who is always alone.
A girl who is always blue.
A girl who is always shedding tears.
I couldn't bring myself to leave that girl alone.
That's why I'm walking down this hallway.
Paintings were hung on the walls of the hallway.
These were the paintings that Tipi apparently drew, one each day.
In the paintings drawn on brand new paper, a single girl was depicted.
I immediately knew who that girl was.
A girl drawn small and alone within the large paper.
Tears streamed down her cheeks.
All of the recent paintings had the same composition.
A painting of a solitary girl crying.
Seeing those paintings, my chest ached terribly.
The girl had always been alone.
I felt like I understood that sadness.
I wanted to quickly wipe away that sadness.
I wanted to tell her that she wasn't alone.
I wanted to tell her that I was by her side.
Dragging my wet soles, I proceeded down the long hallway.
As I gazed at the paintings hung at a height Tipi could reach, I continued forward.
At that moment, I suddenly felt a sense of incongruity.
It wasn't because of the content of the paintings.
The problem was the number of paintings.
No matter how you looked at it, Tipi was a very young girl.
Even if that child drew a picture every day, could she really have drawn this many?
...Perhaps there were days when she drew several pictures in a single day.
Even so, the number of these paintings was impossible.
Was the girl that lonely?
Did she have nothing else to do but draw?
Ah, why did I leave the girl alone?
How many tears did I make her shed because of that?
The amount of tears in the paintings increased with each passing day.
It seemed to represent how the girl's sadness was deepening.
I hurried.
To the girl who was probably crying alone in the depths of this place.
In order to heal that sadness.
And to wipe away those tears.
The girl...to embrace her body in these two hands.
I walked as quickly as I could, to the deepest part of the library, until I was out of breath.
