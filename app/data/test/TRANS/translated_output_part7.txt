This was the library.
I must have fallen asleep yesterday and woken up here this morning.
I hurriedly took off my gloves and checked my right hand.
The thing that should have crumbled just now was still there, unchanged.
But, just like in the dream, it's made of machine.
On my lap, Tipi was already fast asleep, snoring softly.
His innocent sleeping face doesn't betray any of yesterday's sadness.
It seems I was experiencing what humans call a dream.
During sleep mode, the memory banks are reorganized, so I sometimes catch glimpses of past records.
But what I just saw was probably a prediction based on experience and memory.
Does that mean this kind of possibility is hidden in the future... that's what was calculated?
Even so, how sad.
I still couldn't calm the unrest deep within my chest.
Why do Shiona's tears shake me up this much?
And why am I so powerless?
I am not real.
I knew that.
I thought I knew that.
But even so, I want to make them laugh.
I want to make Shiona, Tipi, and everyone in town laugh.
But, I can't do it.
I have an idea why, but I don't want to admit it.
--It's because I'm artificial.
The one truth I can't resist, no matter what.
But even so, I wished for it.
I want to make everyone around me smile.
And yet, I can't make it happen.
When I try to make Tipi smile, Shiona won't smile.
When I try to make Shiona smile, I can't wipe away Tipi's tears.
How difficult it is.
Isn't there a better way to make everyone smile?
While looking at Tipi's sad sleeping face, I repeated it over and over in my heart.
I stroke Tipi's head with my fingertip.
His smooth hair lets my fingertip pass through to the ends without tangling.
A sweet scent spreads.
"Unn... unnn..."
Is he dreaming? Tipi let out a small voice.
Looking at his innocent sleeping face, my desire to protect him grows stronger.
But, how?
Alternating my gaze between my mechanical right hand and Tipi's face, I was at a loss.
I wished that this gentle time could last forever.
--But, it couldn't be.
A strange sound echoed from afar.
Footsteps echoed, as if many people were walking at the exact same time.
And, faintly, the sound of screams and something being destroyed.
Those two sounds crushed even my small hope.
I hurriedly put on my glove on my right hand.
"W-What... Rei, what is it...?"
Tipi woke up to the abnormality.
An anxious expression that wasn't there until just now spread across Tipi's face.
"I don't know... but it seems like something happened."
"Something? What something?"
"I have no idea. But I'm sure it's not good."
I stood up and pointed my toes towards the library aisle.
"...Rei? Where are you going?"
"I'm just going to check things out."
"No... don't go, Rei."
"It's okay, I'm not going anywhere. I'm just going to check things out on the roof for a little while."
"No... I don't want you to go..."
Tipi hugged me and shed tears.
She must be superimposing my disappeared parents' image onto me.
"It's okay. It's okay, Tipi."
"N-No... no..."
"Have I ever broken a promise with you, Tipi?"
"That's, that's right. Whenever you said you'd go see me, you always did, right?"
"So it's okay. I'll take a look from the roof and come right back."
"...Okay. But, come back quickly, okay?"
"Yeah, of course."
After making that promise with Tipi, I headed to the library roof.
I climbed the long spiral staircase and arrived in front of an old, rusted door.
There was no sign it had been used for a long time.
When I opened it, a grating, unpleasant sound echoed in my ears.
Without minding, I pushed the door open.
...At that very moment.
An anomaly jumped into my eyes.
Black smoke was rising from all over town.
The scream-like sounds weren't my imagination; they were coming from the mouths of townspeople fleeing from something.
And chasing after those townspeople were multiple figures clad in soiled cloaks.
Silently, they simply walked while holding firearms--yet, with efficient coordination, they were surely cornering the fleeing people.
It was as if everything was calculated, that kind of movement.
The townspeople cornered against the wall and the attackers are exchanging words.
The attackers exchange glances and nod to each other, then point the muzzle of their guns at the townspeople's heads.
And without showing a shred of hesitation, they pull the finger they had on the trigger.
With a dry sound, their head shook violently as if exploding, and the townspeople collapsed on the spot......
The sound snapped me back to reality, and I understood the situation.
It's hard to believe... but it seems this town is under attack.
What Shiona was saying was true after all...
I hurried back to the lobby.
Seeing me like that, Tipi asked anxiously.
"Rei... did something happen? You have a really scary look on your face."
"...I don't really know... but... something bad is happening..."
Unable to tell Tipi directly what I saw, I spoke vaguely.
"Something bad? What do you mean?"
"I think... this town is being attacked."
"No... Tipi's scared..."
"It's okay, it's far away in the town. It should still be safe here, so calm down."
"...Okay... but, what are we going to do?"
"I'm going to go and see what's happening."
I was worried about the town, but I was even more worried about Shiona.
Even though what happened yesterday, she's still a person who helped me.
I haven't even asked why Shiona, who is kind to everyone, is so harsh only to Tipi.
I still don't understand the meaning of her words that it was for my sake.
"No, don't go... please... Rei..."
"It's okay, Tipi. I'll definitely come back."
"Really? Really, really?"
"Yeah, of course. So, can you wait for me a little bit?"
"If you come back, Tipi will wait."
Tipi hugged her bear tightly.
Even so, the anxiety couldn't be erased from her expression.
Is there nothing I can do for this girl's sadness and anxiety?
Leaving the library with such a guilty feeling in my heart, I left the library.
I decided to use back streets as much as possible on the way to town.
What's happening in town is clearly not good.
There's a risk that I might suffer some damage if I'm found.
I headed to the plaza, trying to keep my footsteps as quiet as possible.
I wanted to arrive before the squad if possible, but it seemed impossible because I kept taking detours.
The closer I got to the center of town, the more broken buildings I noticed.
But those were all buildings that didn't seem like they would break until yesterday.
Were they destroyed by those strangers who were chasing the townspeople yesterday?
Dusty smoke drifts through the town that was beautiful until yesterday.
Why would they need to destroy the buildings in this peaceful town?
I just can't understand it.
Amidst the screams and the noise of buildings being destroyed, I arrived at the truth.
–The tragedy unfolding in the plaza.
Many men were chasing and capturing the townspeople.
Pointing guns and using unreasonable violence as a shield, they were driving men, women, and even children without discrimination.
The captured townspeople are being made to sit in the center of the plaza.
Children crying out. Inarticulate shouts of anger.
The armed men, not caring about those voices, have cool faces.
No, perhaps the expression 'cool faces' is wrong.
They had faces that showed no interest, like glancing at a stone lying on the roadside.
I can't see Shiona anywhere within my field of vision. I should assume she hasn't been captured yet...?
"--What's the situation?"
"--We've captured the majority of the residents. It's only a matter of time for the rest."
Nearby, I overheard two men talking.
Making sure they don't notice me, I slowly approached the two and eavesdropped.
"How are the water and food supplies?"
"They were sufficiently stocked. We even found an underground water source for the water."
"I see, so it's become a bigger harvest than expected."
"Yes, it's possible to settle here permanently."
I was certain.
These men are the humans who raided the town and stole water and food.
I just couldn't forgive their senselessness.
To hurt innocent people for the sake of mere plunder...
But, I couldn't do anything more than that.
I couldn't even jump out from that spot.
I knew better than anyone that I was powerless.
"Still, how did you find such a small town?"
"--There was that slave who escaped the other day, right?"
"If I remember correctly, he was advocating for coexistence with the Phloids..."
"Yes. A foolish man trapped in old-fashioned ideas. Coexistence and harmony with the Phloids... such useless thinking in this world."
--Coexistence and harmony...
That phrase brings to mind a certain young man.
The one I helped, brought to this town... and whose last words those were before he passed.
Does that mean these humans are the ones who inflicted those injuries on him?
"That's right, we treated him like a Phloid and kept him alive as labor."
"Indeed. Chasing after him to bring him back unexpectedly proved useful."
One of the men continued in a monotonous voice.
"After all, a human appeared to help that man and guided us to the town."
Hearing those words, I felt a chill run down my spine.
Why didn't I consider the cause of that young man's injuries back then?
I should have known from Shiona that there was a group carrying out looting...
Even when returning to town, if I had paid more attention to my surroundings, I might have avoided being followed.
I regret taking such rash actions on a momentary impulse.
I'm the one who created the cause of this raid──……it's me.
"We've finished gathering the town's leaders in one place. Zero resisters."
"I see. Then, select from among them those who are oral intake types and lack production or management abilities. Factors that reduce productivity are──"
As he said that, the man receiving the report pulled a pistol from his pocket.
"Dispose of them."
"--Stop!"
At the same moment I understood the meaning of those words, I shouted.
However, I couldn't help but shout at these humans who so casually said 'dispose' of the townspeople who had taken care of me.
With that, the men who were there turned around.
And, our eyes met.
"Secure him."
With that voice, the men rushed towards me.
In a panic, I started running.
But, my body isn't keeping up with my feelings.
My feet aren't moving properly, and I ended up running away while losing my balance.
The men are quickly closing in behind me.
Their movements are mechanically precise.
Damn, at this rate, I'll be caught.
It's now or never, I dashed into the back alley.
The back alley had several muddy spots due to the rain.
Even as my feet were getting caught, I kept running.
Occasionally, I knocked over lumber leaning against the wall, trying to slow the men down.
But, that wasn't enough to stop them.
I could tell the men were right behind me.
Can I really escape like this...?
The place I was aiming for was the library.
Even if I could make it to the library, Tippy's existence would be revealed to them.
If Tippy were to be attacked--.
I changed the direction of my toes.
I dashed into what seemed to be a back door of the nearest building.
Coincidentally, it was Mad's general store.
I searched for a place to hide--.
!?"
I found a figure sitting in a chair.
Mad didn't answer. Just like that day after he ran the projector, he sat shallowly in the chair with his arms crossed.
"Mad, you can hear me, right!? Stop joking around at a time like this, Mad-- Mad?"
I barely managed to swallow my scream.
The moment I touched Mad's shoulder, Mad--quietly collapsed from the chair. As if he were already dead.
Wh-Why--!
Did those men 'dispose' of him? But, there don't seem to be any external wounds.
Target acquired.
What snapped me out of my near panic was, ironically, the voices of the men who had been chasing me.
However, it was far too late.
We have enough manpower as it is, eliminate.
Unable to do anything, I just frantically jumped back from Mad, the men stepped in, and the lead man aimed his gun at me──
Rei!
Immediately after, several things happened at once.
A dry sound rang out, the sound of a gunshot.
And, a figure slid in front of me as if to protect me--.
Shio--
It took me a moment to grasp the situation.
That person was standing there, as if to shield me.
That person turned only their face to look at me.
With the same unchanging smile, that person looked at me.
And, a few seconds later--.
Shionaaaaaa!
With a completely blank mind, I scream.
Seeing that figure, my body began to move unconsciously.
With the mechanical arm hidden beneath my glove, I punched down one of the shelves. That caused a chain reaction, toppling shelves throughout the store--scattering fine fragments and even finer dust everywhere.
At the same time, I picked up a can that had fallen on the floor and threw it with all my might at the window.
The men reacted to the sound of the window glass shattering.
Did he escape through the window?
Chase him!
The men jumped out through the still-open door.
They're gone--
And as for me, I was crouching motionlessly right next to the fallen shelf, half of my body sunk into the floor that had been knocked out by the impact.
Hugging Shiona close to my chest so that the shelves and fragments wouldn't hit her.
Shiona, Shiona, stay with me!
I desperately shake Shiona, whose eyes are closed.
It seems she's lost consciousness.
I run my eyes over Shiona's body, but I can't find any wounds.
Could it be that the bullet didn't hit her? But, since she's unconscious, I can't say she's unharmed.
In any case, I have to evacuate immediately.
…Near here, a place where I can do that is…
I take a deep breath and remember.
The girl I left waiting at the library.
I took the back streets, careful to avoid being seen by the humans, and headed back to the library.
Carrying Shiona on my back was a considerable handicap, but I weaved through the ruined buildings again and again.
During that time, Shiona didn't move at all. That made it easier to carry her, but at the same time, my anxiety grew.
If something were to happen to Shiona--I was almost crushed by that fear, but I arrived at the library.
The clouds covering the sky had darkened even further.
Having finally reached the library, I began searching for Tippy.
Is Tippy alright?
For now, there were no signs of the library having been ransacked.
No signs of anyone having entered.
After passing through the entrance, the interior of the library was silent.
Feeling relieved, I weaved between the shelves, searching for Tippy.
But no matter how much I searched, I couldn't find Tippy.
Could it be--.
Trying to shake off the unpleasant thought, I desperately searched the area.
Could it be--.
Clinging to hope, I headed to the lobby.
I went around to the back.
There, I found Tippy, covering her ears and eyes, trembling slightly.
I reached out my hand to that small body.
Tippy, I'm back.
Tippy's shoulders twitched slightly.
But when she recognized me, she hugged me with the force of a leap.
"Welcome back. I believed in you, Rei."
She pressed large tears against my chest.
Her body was trembling slightly.
Ah, I had made this child anxious again.
I put my hand on her back and stroked it.
"It's okay... I'll never leave you again."
Perhaps relieved by those words, Tippy's trembling lessened and eventually stopped.
"What happened? What's wrong with Shiona?"
Tippy stared at Shiona, who still had her eyes closed, and asked anxiously.
I told her the truth without hiding anything.
"She was shot. To protect me... She doesn't seem to be injured, but she's unconscious..."
"Show me right away!"
With unprecedented agility, Tippy scooped up Shiona and laid her on the floor.
"Rei, turn around, I'm going to check Shiona's injuries."
"Ah, okay... Wait, is Shiona injured!?"
"I don't know. But I'm going to check."
Seeing Tippy's hand on Shiona's clothes, I hurriedly turned around.
Shortly after--
"...I'm okay, there were no problems...Rei."
Tippy's tone had returned to normal.
I quietly turned around.
Shiona was breathing peacefully on the lobby floor where she was laid down.
I thought she had been shot protecting me, but it seems she just lost consciousness from the close-range gunshot.
"I'm glad..."
I sighed with heartfelt relief.
"Rei, why was Shiona shot?"
"Humans came. And they're starting to loot in this town. Destroying buildings--"
I didn't mention that they were trying to 'dispose' of the townspeople, or that Mad-san might have already been 'taken care of'.
"And when I was found and about to be shot, Shiona protected me--"
I clenched my fist tightly without thinking. Tippy looked at me sadly,
"--I see. But if that's the case... this place might be dangerous too."
She replied with a solemn face.
"Can't we just hide and wait it out... until the humans leave somehow...?"
As if to stop my words, Tippy sadly shook her head.
"The humans have found this town. A town for them to live in. So, they'll come here too."
"No way... are they going to settle down here...?"
"Because this is a 'town'."
A town... That's right.
I walked across barren lands before I reached this place.
With no food or water, I was constantly facing death.
Those humans must have traveled through such a world too.
If that's the case, this "town" is a paradise they couldn't have wished for more.
"But... even so, why do they have to steal? The people of this town would have accepted them."
"It's for them to live."
"Just because it's for that, doesn't mean they can do anything... it's wrong to sacrifice someone else!"
"...Rei, scary..."
"Ah, sorry, I didn't mean to scare you, Tippy..."
I released the fist I had clenched in anger and stroked Tippy's head to reassure her.
Let's think about Tippy and Shiona for now.
If we stay in town like this, these two will be in danger too.
I really want to help everyone in town. But, I can't right now. I don't have the power or wisdom.
I'll freeze the emotions that Shiona and the townspeople taught me for now, and mechanically... make the most efficient choice.
Let's go somewhere we can settle down for a while.
"Tippy, let's leave town for now. And let's think about how to help the townspeople."
As I said that, my chest tightened.
It's because I put a rank on lives.
I chose the lives in front of me, within reach.
That must be a shameful thing. The weight of life is equal, yet... I'm still trying to choose...
"Yeah, I think that's a good idea."
The little girl's nod lightens my sense of guilt.
"Let's hide out in that abandoned factory for now. There shouldn't be anything there that the humans would want."
"Then, I have to prepare food for Rei and Shiona..."
"That's right. I wish we could somehow get to the church."
The library and the church where we are now are on opposite sides of the square, at opposite ends of town.
Even if we leave the town and make a big detour, we won't last long if we're targeted in a place with no cover. On top of that, I'll be carrying Shiona on my back.
So, does that mean we have to go through the rubble again? It'll be even more difficult this time since Tippy's with us...
I explained that to Tippy as clearly as possible.
"Is it hard to go to the church?"
"Yeah... for now, it is."
"Then, you should go under!"
"...Under?"
"Yeah, under. Go under the ground to the church."
"Yeah, underground. If it's underground, no one will find you."
"Underground... underground, huh... but how?"
"Go inside through the manhole, and then just go under the town."
...I see.
Certainly, if we did that, we could get to the church without being seen by anyone.
"That's a great idea, Tippy! You're amazing, Tippy!"
"Ehehe... Rei praised me."
"But, where are the manholes located in town?"
"Hmm... Rei, come here."
Tippy takes my hand and leads me to a bookshelf.
Without the slightest hesitation, she came to a certain bookshelf.
"That book."
I take the book Tippy is pointing at and open it.
Inside was a map of the town's manhole locations and its underground waterways.
"You're amazing, Tippy! With this, we can get to the church without any problems."
"Thank you... Rei."
I pat her head, and Tippy narrows her eyes in delight.
"Alright, Tippy. Let's get going right away."
"Okay... but wait. I'll get ready, so just a little bit--wait?"
"Yeah, sure."
"Thank you, Rei."
She bows quickly and disappears into the back room.
Tippy said she was okay, but I'm still worried that she hasn't regained consciousness.
Maybe the humans didn't shoot her with a gun that fires bullets, but with a weapon that robs you of your freedom.
If I know the cause, I can figure out how to deal with it.
Is this how terrifying an unknown situation can be?
"Rei, sorry to keep you waiting. --What's wrong?"
Tippy came back from the back room.
"No, it's nothing. I was just a little worried about Shiona."
I answered, trying to appear as calm as possible.
"So, what are you taking with you?"
Tippy, who said she was getting ready, was carrying a large bag.
"A stuffed animal and... a picture book and... crayons."
"I see. They're important to you, aren't they?"
"And... pictures of Papa and Mama."
Tippy said sadly.
Pictures of her parents, who will probably never return.
I don't know how Tippy feels as she stares at those photos.
"Um, then what's this?"
Apart from the large bag, Tippy was carrying a thin but sturdy metal bag. It seemed a little too rugged for little Tippy to carry.
"This is... I'll tell you about it later. More importantly, Rei, let's go."
"Ah, okay..."
With Tippy's help, I carry Shiona, who is lying on the floor, on my back. Strangely, I couldn't feel her weight.
"I'm ready, Tippy."
"Okay, then... goodbye."
Tippy said goodbye to the countless bookshelves.
Her voice sounded somewhat sad.
I still haven't been able to heal this girl's sadness at all.
But I haven't given up.
We'll be together from now on.
Even if it's just little by little, as we spend time together...
I want to heal Tippy's sadness.
And someday, I want to see Tippy with a genuine smile on her face.
That was my secret wish right now.
"Alright, let's go."
"--Okay."
Even so, Tippy followed me without uttering a single complaint.
By the time we reached the church, we were quite exhausted.
There were no signs of humans around.
We cautiously looked around and stepped into the church.
The chapel was silent.
It was a silence that made the town's commotion seem like a lie.
I found a music box on the altar at the back of the chapel.
Was this where Shiona listened to its melody?
The sound of my footsteps as I walked towards the music box echoed loudly in the chapel.
I approached the altar and reached for the music box.
As I turned the handle, a melody poured out from inside.
That melody warmed the depths of my heart somehow.
--Suddenly, I heard a singing voice.
It came from behind me.
"Welcome back,"
Shiona said, and got off my back.
"That's not important. Are you hurt anywhere? Tippy said you were okay, but..."
"Yeah, I seem to be fine."
Shiona smiled to reassure me. Then, she looked at Tippy, who was next to her.
"Tippy-chan... you came too, huh?"
"Yeah--"
Tippy nodded, looking as sad as ever--yet with a look of resolve on her face.
"Shiona..."
Tippy held her palm out towards Shiona, stopping her words.
"I understand... I understand, but!"
Shiona looked down, as if enduring something.
"--Shiona."
In response, Tippy was gentle as ever...
Those were such unexpected words. Shiona gasped and stared into Tippy's small eyes.
"While I was with Rei, I realized what Shiona is trying to do."
"But, if that's the case--"
"That's another reason why I came here. The library is impossible now... Probably this town too."
"Tippy-chan, I'm sorry..."
"It's okay. Shiona doesn't need to cry."
Kneeling down, Shiona jumped into Tippy's arms, and Tippy gently embraced her, saying that.
It was as if Tippy was the older sister, giving one that illusion.
"Rei, what are you going to do now?"
Tippy's words snapped me back to reality.
"If Shiona seems okay, I want to help the people of the town. Especially those who were said to be disposed of--"
"Disposed of?"
"Yeah..."
It was a terrible way of putting it... Speaking as if they didn't see other humans as humans.
"Can you do it, Rei?"
"I don't know, but... even so, I can't just stand by and watch someone get killed right in front of me."
"But, Rei, you'll be in danger."
"Yeah, I know that, but..."
They're the kind of guys who would point a gun at you without a second thought. There's nothing I can do by confronting them head-on.
I'm sure even having a discussion would be impossible.
"I promise. If it gets even a little dangerous, I'll definitely turn back."
"Absolutely. If Rei gets hurt--everything will be irreversible."
"Yeah. I can't just leave Shiona behind either."
"Rei..."
"Shiona--"
With that one word, we separated as if magnets repelled each other.
"S-Sorry! It's not like I forgot about Tippy-chan!"
"Only Shiona... that's not fair..."
Tippy pouted slightly, saying that.
"I'm sorry, Tippy. I didn't mean for it to happen..."
I apologized while gently stroking Tippy's head.
"Muu... That's not what I meant..."
Even so, Tippy's expression wasn't entirely displeased.
Shiona was the first to laugh at that, followed by me and then Tippy, all smiling.
And so, we laughed together.
Without a word, the three of us held hands.
As if never to be separated again, we gripped each other's hands tightly.
And before that resolve could waver, I declared.
"From now on, let's always be together, the three of us. Always--"
But, as if to mock me...
In the distance, the sound of footsteps echoed.
Shiona's smile, Tippy's smile, stiffened.
I'm sure I'm stiffening up too.
Everyone in town has been captured.
Then, the one heading towards this church now is--
Without a doubt, it's a human.
I was the first to move. I looked out the window, careful not to make a sound.
There's only one figure. However, I don't know how many more are coming behind.
Shiona, Tippy, head to the back of the chapel. Crouch down as much as possible, so you can't be seen from outside.
That's fine, but shouldn't we lock the door first?
No way. If we do that, they'll definitely call for backup. If that happens, we won't stand a chance.
I want to neutralize the human outside without making any noise if possible.
If it's just one person, I think I can manage. If there are two, we can somehow manage with a surprise attack.
But, if there are three or more... I haven't told Shiona or Tippy, but I was prepared to be captured alone.
I muffled my footsteps and stood in the shadow of the door. In the meantime, the footsteps are getting closer and closer.
The number is one. For now, there's no one following behind.
…Haaah…
I quietly took a deep breath and steeled myself.
I held my breath. The footsteps are--right nearby.
The door slowly opened.
Following that, a man holding a pistol slowly entered.
--Now!
In that instant, I swung my arm down with all my might from his blind spot.
Immediately, I kicked away the pistol that fell to the floor.
At the same time, I tried to sweep his legs, but he dodged it, as expected.
We're still close enough to be almost touching.
It's safe to assume he has weapons other than a gun.
If so, I can catch him off guard by pouncing on him the moment he reaches for one.
But the man quietly tilted his head and looked at me.
What do you think you're doing?
He asked in a monotone voice.
Why are you hostile to us? Are you the owner of this town?
Owner? I just want to do what's best for the people of this town.
That's just like something a Phloid would say.
...So what if it is...? That's my reason for existing.
As I said that, I removed the glove from my right hand, showing off my mechanical hand.
It's not a good idea to fight me head-on with my mechanical body.
If I can make him think that, maybe he'll back off.
Right now, I just need to ensure Shiona and Tippy's safety. Even if my true identity is exposed to them, I'll protect what I want to protect.
That's my role as a Phloid.
The man tilted his head again at my actions.
What are you talking about? Phloids can't take any combat actions. They're made to obey orders, so they can't go against humans.
