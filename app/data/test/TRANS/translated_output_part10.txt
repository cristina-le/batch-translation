Tears streamed hotly from my eyes.
"Emotional function runaway confirmed. Maintenance may be required."
"No, that won't be necessary. It would be good to cherish that emotion... Only the knowledge was left behind, but it took a great deal of time to recover the technology to utilize it. I'm sorry."
The man spoke to me gently.
I felt a nostalgic shadow in his expression.
It's not in the records... my memories...
"Anyway, shall we go home after finishing all the maintenance?"
"Where to?"
"To town."
Outside the facility was dazzling.
The sky was blue and endlessly high. White clouds flowed slowly, drawing various shapes.
Warm air filled my artificial lungs. A gentle breeze softly stroked my hair.
It was a natural sight.
For some reason, I felt nostalgic for this ordinary world.
And... for some reason, I felt very sad.
We drove along the paved road.
Every scene visible from the window was beautiful.
Lush greenery thrived.
Small fish leaped on the surface of a clear stream.
In the sky, small birds chirped and flew together in harmony.
"Alright, we're here."
Passing through the gate, we arrived at a town surrounded by white walls.
It was overflowing with many people.
Humans and Phylloids alike, holding hands and living ordinary lives.
That sight made my eyes grow hot again.
"Excuse me, there is still a risk of emotional function runaway. The rhythm pattern in my chest is also not at a normal value."
"It's alright. I'm sure it's the right thing."
"Is that so? In that case, am I a defective product?"
"No, you're perfectly normal. You're closer to a human than any other Phylloid."
Those words were very pleasing to me as a Phylloid.
But I don't understand why I'm told that.
I gazed intently at the town that I felt nostalgic for.
In a corner of the plaza, a human child and a child-type Phylloid were playing happily.
That's a photo studio. The Phylloid owner was smiling as he took pictures of a human family.
At a general store some distance away, a human was shopping, and the Phylloid owner was dealing with them curtly.
"Sensei, welcome back!"
A very cute Phylloid girl came running towards me.
"Hello, I'm back. Have you been a good girl, Dorothy?"
"Yes! I drew lots of pictures while Sensei was gone. Look!"
The little girl showed me the picture she had probably drawn, with a beaming smile.
The townspeople are in a circle, laughing.
The picture drawn with crayons is very warm, and just looking at it makes my heart feel warm.
It was a picture that made everyone who saw it feel happy.
"Huh? You are..."
The girl looks up at me.
"Nice to meet you. I'm Alice, nice to meet you."
"Ali...ce? Hello, Alice. Dorothy isn't registered, so she's Dorothy."
"Yeah, me too."
An unregistered Phylloid. If I don't have a primary partner, what should I do?
Perhaps sensing my anxiety, the man next to me patted me on the shoulder.
"What do you want to do?"
"...What am I capable of...?"
"Alice, can you sing a song?"
"Yes, a song. Like this."
Dorothy closes her eyes and begins to sing.
It was a little clumsy, but it was a song I recognized.
"It's a song that's been sung since long, long ago. There's no one in the world who doesn't know it."
The man said, taking a music box out of the car.
He opened the lid and turned the handle protruding from the side of the box.
A clear sound was emitted, and a gentle melody began to flow.
Drawn in by the melody, the townspeople begin to gather.
Everyone listens to the sound, their expressions softening.
I know this scene.
In the deepest part of my memory, which should be completely blank, a small, breathing memory gently taps at my heart.
My mouth moved naturally.
The song, which should be the first time I've sung it, was familiar to my throat, my lips... my heart.
The music box melody that fills the square is very nostalgic.
Wow, that's so beautiful! You're so good!
Yes, this song... it's a very important song.
