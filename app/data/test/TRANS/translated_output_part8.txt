"Huh?"
"In any case, you're an incompatible element trapped in old-fashioned thinking. I'll eliminate you before you become a source of trouble."
The blade is thrust straight towards my throat.
I grab the knife's blade with my mechanical right hand. Then, I put all my strength into it and twist it sharply.
With just that, the knife blade snapped clean off at the base.
I put my entire body weight into pushing him down. I press my left elbow against his throat and pin his legs with my knees--
"Rei!"
Shiona burst out from the back of the room.
I pressed down on the man's throat with my left hand and said, raising my bare metal right hand.
This is a metal arm that can break knives. If I swing it down on his head with all my might, he won't come out of it unscathed.
"Rei, stop!"
Shiona pleaded in a trembling voice.
--But.
Gritting my teeth, I put all my strength into--swinging my right hand down.
My right hand was half-buried.
Not in the man's head, but in the floor right next to it.
"Why spare me? Considering your own safety, killing me is the correct choice."
The man said, remaining expressionless as ever.
"That's not true. Killing someone is the wrong choice, no matter the reason."
"Incorrigible. Such an inefficient way of thinking."
"I'll take you hostage. And make them release the townspeople."
I grab the man by the collar and pull him up.
"That's pointless. My life has no such value. If my death now opens the way for my comrades' future, there's no reason to regret it."
Without changing his tone in the slightest, the man took something out of his pocket.
It was an old-fashioned bomb. He pulled out the safety pin and grabbed my arm at the same time.
"What!"
I instantly pull my arm back, but it doesn't budge.
I shudder.
Why doesn't this human show any emotion on his face, even at this moment when he's about to throw his life away?
I felt like I was being bound by the color of his eyes, which seemed devoid of any will.
--No good! If I let my thoughts stop, it's over!
I instantly switch gears and start analyzing the situation.
What the man is holding is a really small bomb, about the size of a small fruit.
But, since it's a bomb, it will have lethal force, and more importantly, the blast could alert the humans staying in the town.
When? When will it explode?
The other guy intends to blow himself up. It's certain that there isn't much time.
But, what should I do? If the scale of the explosion is large, Shiona and the others hiding will also be affected.
It's impossible to neutralize this bomb, so what's the best way to minimize its effect?
I reflexively hug the man. In a way that sandwiches the bomb.
This way, I might at least be able to protect Shiona and the others from the blast. It might be imperfect, but it's the best choice I can think of.
If only I can save at least these two──
The next moment, the impact came.
From the side. Like being shoved away... no, I was shoved!
While rolling on the floor, I look at the place I was just in.
There, holding the bomb, was Shiona.
"Shiona!"
"Get down!"
The bomb she was clutching burst with a strong light and sound.
Perhaps the scale of the explosion wasn't that large because it was a type of bomb not intended for killing.
Even so, I, who was at point-blank range, was hit directly by the blast and sound, and felt dizzy.
The human who was also at point-blank range has also lost consciousness.
"Shiona!"
In my swaying vision, I shouted.
Please, please be safe.
"Shiona!?"
"...Rei..."
"Shio...na..."
"Shiona, we need to treat you immediately!"
The distance of a few steps felt incredibly long.
Slapping my faltering legs, I approach Shiona.
There, I saw it.
What... is this...
Seeing Shiona's figure, I was speechless.
Her right arm was thrown onto the floor... from the wrist onward... a metallic... frame?
Not bone. Absolutely not. It's clearly different from a human's.
And... it's gone.
That's strange.
Something that should be there, isn't.
Red.
That is the proof of a human.
Wh-wh-why...
B-but...
I clench my mechanical right hand, covered by a glove.
Yes, if we were the same... if only we were the same...
Shiona, are you... alright?
Yeah, I'm fine with this much.
There's no way that's true.
There's no way that could be true.
She took the explosion at such close range.
There's no way she could be alright.
It must be so painful that she can't help but shed tears from the intense pain.
And yet.
And yet, why?
"Rather than me... Rei, your head."
I followed Shiona's gaze and touched my head.
--Ah, I wonder why.
Why is it that something Shiona needs is with me?
I don't need this.
I don't need this, so I wish Shiona had it.
No, she should have had it.
Shiona touches my head and says.
"You're bleeding, are you okay?"
Blood was flowing from my head.
Red.
Red blood.
Something that doesn't flow in a Philoid...
In contrast, not even a drop of blood flowed from Shiona's arm.
Instead, exposed mechanical parts are visible.
What this means is only one thing.
That is--
"...Rei? There was a loud noise, are you okay--Shiona!? Rei!?"
Tipi, who came out from the back, screamed.
Her expression was anxious, and her eyes were filled with tears.
"You both need to heal your injuries...!".
"It's okay... I'm okay, so...".
I gently embraced Tipi, who was on the verge of panicking, as if to envelop her.
Embraced, Tipi's face showed a slight expression of relief in my chest.
But it was unstable.
It looked like it was about to collapse at any moment, and it made my chest ache.
"Rei... let's move, we can't stay here anymore..."
Tipi said in a trembling voice. Shiona also nodded in agreement.
Certainly, with that explosion just now, other humans will definitely come.
There were many things I wanted to ask.
There were many things I wanted to confirm.
But, I swallow it all for now.
"...Let's go, let's leave town."
We left the church with only the bare minimum of luggage.
Then, following Tipi's instructions, we used the back streets of the town to escape to the outside, and headed for the abandoned factory.
Even there, I was made to realize...
That the fatigue made my steps heavy... was only me.
Led by Tipi and with Shiona pulling my hand, we continued walking.
Reaching the abandoned factory, I finally lowered myself to the ground.
Next to Shiona, who had a cool face, I tried to catch my ragged breath.
"Tipi, going to get water."
The little girl glanced at Shiona and then disappeared into the depths of the abandoned factory.
She probably entrusted all the explanations to Shiona.
"...Shiona."
Shiona returned a slightly troubled smile to my voice.
"I think you've already noticed, but I am... no. Everyone living in this town is a Filoid."
That was... what I was trying to avoid facing.
I had a premonition... I felt something was off... but it was something I didn't want to admit...
"So... I'm a 'human'?"
When my head was damaged, a red liquid leaked from the damaged area.
It closely resembled the 'blood' that flows inside a human body.
Filoids don't have such a liquid, so it shouldn't flow.
"You've been misunderstanding because of the mechanical arm... that's an artificial medical part to replace limbs lost in an accident or something."
"That means... I really am..."
"Yes, you are a human. Our creators and partners, the Filoids. That's who you are. Everyone in town is a Filoid. Only you were human."
"I see..."
I stared at my mechanical right hand covered in a glove and weakly clenched it.
The existence I thought I had was the complete opposite... .
Shiona is a Filoid... and I'm a human... .
In other words, I, myself, am a human, the very existence I should hate.
I felt something deep inside my chest.
That feeling was painful.
Sad.
And infuriating.
I was the same as those cold-blooded, merciless beings I could only see as evil.
My chest ached unbearably.
I felt anger at this unchangeable truth.
What the man I was dealing with earlier said was right.
I wasn't a Filoid, but a human.
And those humans, the rulers, are trying to do terrible things to the townspeople, the Filoids, who are the ruled--no, they probably already are.
How did things end up like this?
I just wanted to live together with Shiona and the townspeople.
I just wanted to make everyone happy.
But, but, but--.
I can't do that.
Because I'm a human.
Because I'm one of those hopeless creatures.
I felt warmth in my fist, which I had unconsciously clenched.
When I lowered my gaze, I saw Shiona's hand placed over mine.
That temperature is artificial.
But, it didn't matter to me.
...It's warm.
Just that alone made the emotions weighing on my heart fade away.
But at the same time, it highlighted my own inadequacy.
Do I even deserve her kindness?
"Do you want to know more? About you guys?"
Shiona said to me with a smile.
"By 'you guys,' do you mean humans?"
"Yes, humans. Do you want to know about our partners?"
If I can learn about it, I want to know.
So I nodded.
"I want to know... I want to know why we ended up like this."
"Ray, do you remember the picture of Tippy-chan in the library?"
"Ah, I remember..."
"That picture, Tippy-chan draws it every day. Every single day, no matter what, one picture a day."
I closed my eyelids and recalled that scene.
There were dozens, hundreds of those pictures drawn with crayons.
"How many do you think there are?"
"I don't know... If Tippy is also a Philoid, she's probably been drawing for years... Maybe there are about a thousand."
"Eighty-six thousand six hundred and seventy-one."
"Eighty-six thou--"
Once again, a strong dizziness attacked me. But it wasn't from the earlier explosion or the subsequent bleeding.
For so long, Tippy had been all alone in that dark library?
Hardly anyone ever came to that library.
It must have been a lonely existence.
Just thinking about the time Tippy spent there, I felt a terror as if I were losing my footing.
And Tippy endured it.
With that small body.
"From there, decades before that, we Philoids were born. Desired by humans--"
Shiona told me the history of the Philoids as if singing a song.
First, Philoids were androids that had reached the practical stage, equipped with human emotions.
Basic emotional information was installed from the beginning, and a system was adopted that allowed them to learn new emotions through self-sufficient thinking circuits.
Including that, it can be said that they are as close to humans as possible.
Therefore, they were able to become as close to humans as possible, not only in work but also in life.
Eventually, companies appeared that installed custom-made emotions and memories, and an unprecedented Philoid boom arrived.
Families who could not have children purchased child Philoids, and those who had lost parents or children ordered Philoids with their memories, ushering in such an era.
In the blink of an eye, the number of Philoids increased, and in just over a decade, the number produced was comparable to the human population.
Among them, the most revolutionary was the Philoid equipped with 'love,' the most complex of human emotions.
It had the ability to serve as a companion for life.
It became possible to obtain a loved one without going through the process of romance, and that love was guaranteed semi-permanently.
In a society where late marriage was progressing and more humans were prioritizing work over romance, the demand was great and it was received with applause.
However, children were not born into families who married Philoids, which accelerated the declining birthrate.
And the declining birthrate created a shortage of marriage partners, creating a loop in which more and more people married Philoids.
And then, before they knew it, humans forgot how to nurture love.
Shiona smiled sadly.
Human children began to be created artificially using science. But humans who had lost love could not teach love to the children who were born.
Love was the origin of all emotions.
Because there is love, you feel the joy of connecting with someone.
Because there is love, you know what you want to protect and feel anger when it is hurt.
Because there is love, you feel sadness when you lose something important.
Because there is love... you share, divide, and know the joy of sharing the same emotions.
But... they forgot it.
The humans who came to town are probably those kinds of "humans."
Humans who have forgotten "emotion" along with love have even lost the ability to care for others.
Humans no longer needed love, and the existence of Philoids with emotions became unpleasant to them.
When they thought about streamlining their actions, they felt it was too wasteful...
Humans eventually came to believe that Philoids should be machines.
To deliberately place them in harsh environments... to have them perform dangerous tasks... to abuse them beyond their specifications...
But there were humans who wouldn't allow it.
Humans who retained the emotion of love appealed, saying that Philoids were partners.
The world was divided in two.
Humans with love, and humans without.
And the humans without love concluded:
That the ideas of the old generation were foolish, that they should be annihilated...
They didn't even hesitate to press the button for a weapon that would scorch the earth.
After that, everything happened quickly.
It didn't even take five days for retaliation to call for retaliation, and for the world to be enveloped in flames and ash.
A polluted, toxic earth, black clouds blocking the sunlight, a sea that could not sustain life.
Human history would come to an end by its own hand...
It was such a foolish choice.
"We, who were born for the sake of humans, ended up stealing the most important thing from them."
"That's not true... we humans are to blame for everything..."
"But you know, there were many humans who survived. No matter how tattered the world becomes, life never stops moving forward."
I can't find the words to respond to Shiona, who speaks to me so gently.
"...Ahem, ah, aah, aah."
Suddenly, Shiona started vocalizing.
And then, she turned to face my puzzled self head-on──
"Nice to meet you. I am Alice mk-17, MODA-117 manufactured by Asou International. Have you completed your user registration? If you have, please decide on my individual name. It's the first name I'll be given. Please choose carefully!"
I was caught off guard.
It's easy enough to say I'd never seen this before... but it was the first time I'd seen Shiona so utterly cheerful and innocent.
"Surprised?"
Shiona asked, back to her usual self.
"Y-yeah..."
"That was the oldest memory I have."
I wonder when that was. I can't even imagine.
"Back then, every day was like a festival... it was so lively."
So saying, Shiona showed me a piece of paper that looked like a newspaper clipping.
"World-renowned Musician Passes Away"
The photo in it was the same one that was in the photo frame in Shiona's room.
He had a face similar to mine.
"Is this... your older brother?"
"Yes, this story is also from a long time ago... You know, I'm the latest model of Philoid that was manufactured. Fifth generation, I think."
I wonder how Shiona feels about describing herself as 'manufactured'.
Philoids have emotions just like humans.
In other words, they're the same as humans.
Can she really be so detached about it?
"My generation was the first model to be equipped with the concept of human 'death'. It was to get as close to humans as possible. But the models before me aren't equipped with it... That's Mad-san and Tippy-chan. Neither of them can understand 'death'. It's useless to explain it. The day they understand it will never come."
To continue waiting, without knowing death.
It's a hope that exists, but a hope that will never be rewarded.
Despair in the guise of hope.
To be confronted with that unconditionally.
If I'm going to be confronted with something like that, wouldn't it be better to just teach me despair from the start?
I thought it would be better that way.
"Tippy-chan is an even earlier model... I think she was a second-generation Philoid. Up to the second generation, they couldn't extract energy from food. That's why she runs on electricity. But there's a limit to how long the battery lasts. She carries that bear plushie as an auxiliary battery for that."
Come to think of it, Tippy always had that plushie in her hands whenever she moved somewhere.
I had no idea it was a battery.
But that explains some things.
Like why Tippy was always in that library.
That library has the only power generation system in town.
Tippy was staying in that place to continue functioning.
"Tippy-chan's parents also died a long time ago. Probably more than 200 years ago. But Tippy-chan, who has no concept of death, is waiting. Always, always, all alone."
What a cruel story.
I don't know the lifespan of a Philoid, but Tippy has spent hundreds of years like that.
Every day, shedding tears.
Trapped by a future that will never come—...held captive by an impossible hope.
All alone in that library.
It feels like there's a lead ball in the depths of my chest.
It's painful and agonizing.
But the more I think about it, the deeper it sinks into my core.
"But, even knowing that, it's still painful."
And Shiona is aware of death. In other words, she can't even hold onto the hope that we might meet again.
"Rei, you saw Mad collapse at the general store, right?"
"Yeah... it was strange. It was like only his soul had been extracted, even though he had no external injuries—"
I understand now. Mad was already broken at that time.
"But, we have to keep living like this. Until the day we die—the day we break. For us who don't get sick, that's a time equal to eternity. That's why we try to be human. Wouldn't it be too sad otherwise? We take over the work that our partners were doing, or we take over the work of positions that have disappeared... We keep the world turning, just like humans used to. So that this world that humans used to run never stops."
Mad ran the general store.
There were various shops in town, like a photo shop and a bar.
All of that was the work of the Philoids.
It was the effort of the Philoids to protect the human world.
It was the last hope of the Philoids who had been left behind.
"So that when humans return someday, we can tell them about the world from those fun times, so that we can give it back to them, we spend every day like this."
Shiona showed a smile.
An emotion that definitely doesn't fit the current situation.
With that smile, Shiona was protecting herself.
That smile looked sad to me.
"...But, we Philoids also have flaws. That is, if something unbearably painful happens, only some kind of emotion comes to the forefront. I'm like this, Mad is always angry, and Tippy-chan is always sad."
But, Shiona continued.
"It's our last fortress. If even that emotion disappears, we'll break... we'll die."
"Then, when Shiona was shot, Mad was—"
"That's right. He didn't just go on a trip. After Rei finished showing him that movie, Mad stopped mov—no, he stopped moving."
"Then, closing the store was—Shiona?"
"Yeah. I thought that if I didn't, Rei would start to wonder, even if the townspeople didn't. And I was right, wasn't I?"
"Well, yeah, but..."
If the store had stayed open there, I definitely would have gone inside and found Mad, unmoving.
If the humans hadn't come, I probably never would have noticed.
In the end, it was confirmed that I wasn't just seeing things.
I didn't want to believe it, but it was the truth.
"My brother used to say, 'Emotions are pieces of the puzzle of life.' The pieces called emotions are what connect life. If emotions are missing, all the pieces will crumble. That's the same for both humans and Philoids. Mad broke because the emotion of anger towards his son dissipated."
If that's the case, then I'm the one who killed Mad.
I went and found the playback device on my own, and I showed Mad his son's movie on my own.
If I hadn't done that, Mad wouldn't have broken and would still be moving now.
As if sensing my feelings, Shiona moved to my left side and placed her hand on mine.
"It's okay, it's not Rei's fault. Sooner or later, we're all destined to end up like that. It's the same as humans not being able to escape death. Mad was surely happy. He was able to know his son's true feelings in the end."
"Maybe so. But—"
An unbearable feeling swells up.
If I had known that back then—I would have stopped him, even by force.
"You're so kind, Rei—"
"That's not true..."
Shiona stood next to me.
I couldn't see Shiona's expression.
Anxiety pounded against my chest from the inside.
"Because even knowing, I still wish for it. I wonder if I'll ever see that smile again."
Shiona smiled sadly as she looked down at her brother's photo.
"That's why, when I first met Rei, I was so happy. Ah, so it was a dream after all, I thought. My brother was alive."
The matter of dying.
Whether you know it or not, it was painful either way.
Created to be convenient for humans, forced to have a family, and then left with only the pain of death.
Selfish and awful.
That's what we, humans, were.
"Tipi is feeling the loneliness of losing her family. That's why, if we act like family, she'll 'die.' But that doesn't mean I don't want you to say those things to Rei. We Philoids have a rule that we can't do or say anything that 'makes us realize we're Philoids.' Because it would shatter the humans' dreams. But, I went too far... I'm sorry."
As Shiona lowered her head, a sweet scent wafted around.
Certainly, what Shiona did wasn't something that could be forgiven.
But, considering Shiona's feelings, it was clear that that method was the most reasonable.
"It can't be helped. Shiona was just following the rules, it's not your fault."
Forgiving someone like this, and someone being forgiven.
Apologizing, and being apologized to.
Crying, getting angry, and laughing.
That's what humans are.
They, the Philoids, knew that better than anyone.
"Thank you for telling me, Shiona. For being so kind to me, a human..."
I felt ashamed as a human.
To think that I was repaying the kindness of these Philoids who were doing so much for me with evil.
Even as we speak, humans in the town might be 'disposing' of Philoids.
And the Philoids probably can't offer much resistance to it.
Thinking that, I couldn't hide the pain deep in my chest.
Shiona gently reached out and embraced me.
A warm warmth enveloped me.
"Of course. Humans and Philoids are partners, both in the past and now. It's decided that it will be that way far into the future, too."
I felt like the emotion I couldn't understand until the very end was there.
It was warm, vast, deep, strong, gentle, soft, large, and precious.
Humans had lost something significant.
But, they remembered what the humans had forgotten.
For many years, many decades, many centuries.
Even while enduring loneliness, they continued to protect it.
I felt like I had to inherit that and protect it in the same way.
It wasn't a duty or an order.
It was something I myself desired.
"I'm back, I found some pretty water," she said.
As I was sharing body heat with Shiona, Tippy called out to us from behind.
For some reason, I felt embarrassed and instinctively distanced myself from Shiona.
The warmth that had been touching my skin was snatched away by the air.
But, that gap was immediately filled with a new warmth.
I looked and saw Tippy had slipped in between Shiona and me.
"Tippy too... hug," she said.
Shiona and I exchanged glances.
Shiona seemed to be entrusting the decision to me.
Tippy has lived in solitude for two hundred years.
If things continue as they are, Tippy will be able to live semi-permanently without breaking.
But, is that happiness?
Does an empty life have any value?
I embraced Shiona.
Including Tippy, who was standing between us.
Shiona, in turn, embraced me as well.
Tippy hugged both of us close, and muttered softly.
"Warm..."
It was warmth after two hundred years.
Tippy had been waiting for something so trivial for two whole centuries.
That was a very sad time...
If I could give her two hundred years' worth of warmth, I would definitely give it to Tippy.
Because if I did, I feel like I could say that the time Tippy waited wasn't wasted.
"What are we going to do now, Rei?"
Shiona asked me, still holding Tippy from behind.
"If I could... I still want to help everyone in town... but I don't think I can right now."
I feel bad for the people in town, but I don't have the power to do so.
First, I want to ensure the safety of Shiona and Tippy.
"It's a little far, but let's go to the factory where I woke up."
No, that place probably wasn't a factory.
A facility where people who could no longer live in the world due to war continued to sleep until the polluted land was somewhat better.
My... awakening was a little late.
"There was still electricity there. Shiona and I can ingest food, so we'll be fine if we have the food we brought from town. But in Tippy's case, she needs to be charged."
"Shiona..."
She must have realized it just from those words. Tippy spoke up.
"Yeah, that's right... I'm sorry."
"No. I thought I had to say it soon."
Somewhat sadly, yet with a slightly stiff expression, Tippy continued.
"Tippy too, has to do what Tippy can do... while I still can."
"...Tippy-chan?"
Something must have caught her, Shiona questioned Tippy.
"The three of us, we'll survive."
It was a baseless statement.
There was no guarantee, nothing.
Even so, I could only continue those words.
"We will, always, always survive together, the three of us."
It was just an ideal.
I know the world isn't sweet enough to live on ideals alone.
Of course, Shiona probably does too.
Even so, Shiona doesn't express any doubts to me.
Anxiety or dissatisfaction.
She sealed all those words away.
Surely her heart must be filled with them.
In fact, my heart was being trampled by those feelings.
Even so, it's necessary.
Words of hope.
"...Yeah."
Shiona nodded and hugged me and Tippy even tighter.
And so, we began our journey towards the facility.
"This is... outside the town..."
Facing the wilderness, Tippy clutches her bear plush to her chest.
"Is this different from the scenery Tippy knows?"
"Yeah. When I saw it before, there was a road, and a forest, and then—and then—"
The scenery Tippy described was like a larger-scale version of the festival-like days Shiona had told me about.
It seems that in those days, humans freely controlled not only towns, but also nature, the Phylloids, and even the weather.
"So... by the time I started operating, humans were already beginning to decline..."
Shiona seems a little lonely. The hem of her clothes is blown wildly by the dust-filled wind.
"Alright, let's go!"
With a little food and a spare battery for Tippy, we started walking through the wilderness to survive.
And more than anything, to survive.
Struggling, struggling, to survive.
Floundering, floundering, to stay alive.
Just being alive is enough.
Just being alive had value.
I truly thought so from the bottom of my heart.
Using the position of the sun, faintly discernible through the dim clouds, as a guide, I walk while searching my memory.
As the sun sets and the temperature drops, the three of us huddle together and fall asleep.
Sometimes singing songs, sometimes encouraging each other, sometimes joking around...
We continue on a journey that is not always just painful.
We crossed the reddish-brown earth and reached our destination three full days later, just as the sun was beginning to set.
"The building is half-buried in sand... No wonder we couldn't find it. I can't believe this kind of facility was still around..."
As we entered, faint lights flickered on, and the air conditioning hummed to life somewhere.
The room was exactly as it had been when I woke up. For now, I gathered up all the Phylloid parts that would be unpleasant for Shiona and Tippy.
I'm sure these Phylloids were protecting us humans while we were in cold sleep.
"Yay, I can sit down!"
Tippy ran ahead and was the first to sit on the sofa that was there.
As soon as she sat down, the strength seemed to drain from her body.
It seems I was pushing her pretty hard.
"...It's kind of cold here."
"It was originally a facility for cold sleep, after all."
Even though we're indoors, it's a little colder than outside.
Now that the air conditioning is working, I'd like to think there's still a function to raise the temperature inside the facility.
But I don't know where it is.
"I wish we had some kind of heater..."
"I know what to do. Rei, sit next to Tippy."
"Like this?"
"Closer!"
"L-Like this?"
When I asked, almost pressed against Tippy, Shiona looked satisfied and said,
"Yeah, that should do it!"
And then she sat on the opposite side of me and Tippy, where we were pressed together.
--Pressed together tightly, just like me and Tippy.
"See? Isn't that warmer?"
"Y-Yeah... I guess so."
It's certainly warm. Warm, but...
"How is it, Tippy? Still cold?"
"Mmm... warm."
Tippy narrowed her eyes and snuggled against my arm.
"Warm? Good, I'm glad."
"Yeah, warm... so, so warm, Rei. It's like..."
"Like what?"
"When we're like this, it's like we're a family."
"............"
"Tippy's Papa and Mama used to hug Tippy like this a lot."
"Yeah. It's like that time, it's warm."
"...Yeah, it's warm, isn't it."
"...Hey, can you hug me again? Can you squeeze Tippy tight?"
I almost hugged her without thinking, but I stopped when I felt Shiona's sad gaze.
"Tippy, I can't do that."
"Why? Won't you squeeze me tight?"
"Yes, that's right. Because Tippy, we're not family or anything."
"Not family... is Tippy all alone?"
"Yes. No matter how long we're together, you're alone. That's something that can't be changed."
If you only picked up the words, they were cold, as if she hated Tippy.
But now I understand.
That those words are filled with kindness.
The only emotion remaining within Tippy.
--Sadness.
To fill Tippy's heart would mean to release her from sadness...
In other words, it's the same as dying.
Until now, I had been hugging Tippy without thinking.
But perhaps that was a kindness that was far too cruel.
No, perhaps it wasn't even kindness at all.
It was nothing more than a self-satisfying act that only shortened Tippy's lifespan.
Shiona had been enduring it all this time.
To protect Tippy's feeling of sadness... more than anything, to protect Tippy.
She must have really wanted to hug her.
She must have wanted to pat her head and say kind words to her.
She must have wanted to give her a smile that turned her heart orange.
Without reaching out to this blue girl, she had been enduring it all this time.
