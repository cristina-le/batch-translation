I can't rely on anyone.
That's why I made thorough preparations.
As I was concentrating on the preparations, I heard a knock on the door.
Immediately after, Shiona came into the room.
"Rei, if you're free, want to go shopping...? Are you going somewhere?"
Shiona asked, looking back and forth between my bag and me.
"Yeah. I'm just looking for something."
"Where are you going? Is it close? Far? When will you be back?"
"I'm going to the abandoned factory. I'm planning to come back as soon as possible."
"Abandoned factory? What are you going there for?"
"Well... actually, the photography studio manager asked me for some parts, and I'm going to look for them."
It was a lie.
It was a clumsy lie, but Shiona smiled at me.
"I see... Okay. Please be really careful, okay? Your right hand isn't in good shape as it is, right?"
"Yeah, thanks. I'll try to get back as soon as possible."
I was seen off by Shiona and left the church.
My destination is the abandoned factory--.
But, there was a place I had to stop by before that.
I need to cover up the lie I blurted out on the spur of the moment.
If, by any chance, Shiona meets the manager and tells him about me, the lie will be exposed.
If that happens, I'll end up hurting Shiona.
I don't want to hurt Shiona.
That's why my feet were taking me to the photography studio.
Oh, a rare customer indeed.
When I opened the door, the manager, who was polishing a camera, greeted me.
I'm sorry for intruding so suddenly.
No, it's fine... I was just about to head home myself.
Home... to the church? Did you have some business there?
Ah, just wait a moment.
The manager disappeared into the back.
While waiting, I decided to look around at the photos on display.
There were various photos on display, from old ones to recent ones.
The years they were taken, the places, and the people were all different.
But there was one thing they all had in common.
That was that everyone was smiling.
I couldn't help but envy the people in those smiling photos.
Well now, sorry to keep you waiting. Here, this is it.
The manager handed me a photo.
In it were a smiling Shiona and a expressionless me.
It's a photo I took a while ago. It took a while to develop. I apologize for the delay.
That's not true at all. Thank you very much. But, I don't have any money...
It's fine. It was delayed, and I took it because I wanted to. I'll make it a service.
Thank you very much. I'll give it to Shiona.
Please do. Even so, looking at it like this, you and Shiona's brother really do look alike.
You know about Shiona's brother?
Ah, of course. Have you ever seen a picture of Shiona and her brother together?
Yes, I have. The one where they're holding a music box, right?
Ah, that's the one. Actually, I'm the one who took that picture.
Is that so...? When did her brother leave on his journey?
It was right after I took that picture, I think. He said he was going to spread music all over the world. Shiona was so sad. She's always smiling like that, but she was crying the whole time then.
Shiona was? I can't believe it...
...But, you know, she's been smiling a lot more lately. As much as when her brother was around... No, maybe even more.
Is that so? I think she's been smiling the whole time, for sure.
I'm sure it's because you're here.
I think it's partly because you resemble her brother, but I don't think that's all there is to it.
But I haven't been able to do anything for Shiona.
Making someone smile isn't just about doing something for them. You can also make them smile just by being near them, by being by their side.
Being by her side... If that's the case, I'm confident that I can be by Shiona's side more than anyone else.
I can see that too. When Shiona is with you, she seems to be showing a smile from the bottom of her heart.
Those words warmed my heart.
I'm connected to Shiona's smile.
Because I'm here, Shiona is--
It's strange for me to ask, but will you stay near Shiona forever?
Of course. Always and forever, I'll stay by Shiona's side and keep her smiling. That's my greatest wish.
Hahaha, it's like a proposal. It's a shame Shiona isn't here to see this.
A pro...posal...?
Hearing those words, I felt my face getting hot.
I know the meaning of the word.
It's a promise between a man and a woman to spend their lives together.
Was what I just said the same as that?
Thinking about it that way, my face gets even hotter.
I turn my back to the shop owner so he won't notice my agitation.
Um, well, I have somewhere to be, so...
Is that so? Don't lose that picture, now.
Yes, thank you very much.
I thanked him over my shoulder and left the photo shop.
The road to the abandoned factory.
I push forward through the reddish-black earth.
The bag full of tools is a heavy burden.
I could hear the tools rubbing against each other in the bag slung over my shoulder.
The wind is strong, and it looks like it's about to rain.
If I go to fix it and end up making more things broken, that would defeat the purpose.
Hoping it wouldn't rain, I hurried to the abandoned factory.
On the way.
In the distance, I spotted something white flickering.
But the location was too far away, and there was no way to confirm what that object was.
I still couldn't tell how big it was, but that white object seemed to be slowly approaching me.
I strained my eyes and tried to get a better look.
At that moment, a gust of wind blew.
I reflexively closed my eyes.
When I opened my eyes again, the white object had disappeared from sight.
What on earth was that just now...?
For a while, I stood there, frozen in place.
But I can't stay like this.
The clouds are getting more and more ominous.
I have to get to the abandoned factory quickly.
Just as the dark clouds threatened to unleash rain, I arrived at the abandoned factory.
The inside was as dusty as ever, filled with the smell of oxidized oil.
Immediately finding a nearby workbench, I decided to remove the glove from my right hand.
I'm already used to the exposed parts.
First, I'll try slowly opening and closing my fingers.
The malfunction wasn't fixed, and the movement stopped halfway.
What could be the cause?
I took out a light from my bag and shined it on my arm, peering inside.
It doesn't seem like there's any foreign object stuck in there.
…In that case, it must be a problem with the internal parts themselves.
I took out my tools and began disassembling my right hand.
I felt a sense of unease at disassembling my own hand.
I am now destroying myself.
If I were to disassemble all of this, would I break down?
Is that my "death?"
I wonder, what kind of feeling would that be?
If I die, where will this consciousness disappear to?
And if it were reassembled once more, would this consciousness return?
Could that be called being alive?
While thinking about such things in the back of my mind, I arrived at the cause of the malfunction.
The piston rod of the cylinder that supplies oil to the fingers was bent, and oil was seeping out.
It's a part I removed once when I fixed Shiona's music box.
At that time, I used the oil inside the cylinder to lubricate the gears of the music box.
It was only a small amount of oil, but it must have been a necessary amount for the intricately moving prosthetic finger.
So even small tears, when accumulated, can become a large wound, huh?
However, with the rod bent this far, even if I fix it halfway, the oil leak might recur.
The most reliable thing to do would be to replace this part entirely with a new one.
I stood up and decided to search around.
Phyloid parts in the middle of being made were scattered on the floor.
If it's here at the Phyloid factory, there's bound to be a part that fits my model lying around.
With my right arm disassembled, I searched the factory.
There were many arm, leg, and torso parts scattered around the factory.
The head parts are so elaborate that, if you're not careful, you might think they're real for a moment.
I searched among them for something that would fit me.
Looking at my exposed right arm, I confirmed the model number of the part I needed.
That seems to be the model number of the necessary part.
I searched for the same model number from the arm parts scattered around.
Am I using something that's really that rare?
Even after examining all the parts scattered around the factory, there wasn't one with the same model number.
The state of decay of this factory is much more advanced compared to the place where I woke up.
I can tell it's a facility that was abandoned a long, long time ago.
In that case, it's understandable that the manufacturing dates are different and there aren't any parts with the same model number.
While searching for parts in a panic, I discovered something marked 'AR115'.
Its appearance is an almost identical shape to the part that was embedded in my arm.
However, the piston rod and shaft are a little long.
With this, it looks like I can replace it with just a little modification.
I placed the arm with 'AR115' attached on the workbench and began disassembling it.
After successfully removing the part, I compared it with the part that was originally embedded in me—'HR114'.
It seems that 'AR115' has an output terminal added that didn't exist in 'HR114'.
There are no other changes.
I immediately tried attaching the part to my arm.
Unlike when disassembling, the installation work was a little difficult.
After dropping the screws many times, I somehow managed to finish the installation.
When I moved my fingers, I was able to open and close them as before.
However, each time, a dissonant sound of machines rubbing against each other echoed around me.
It seems the lubricant has run out.
Seeking oil, I proceeded deeper into the factory.
As the smell of oxidized oil intensified, I came across a dark black drum.
When I opened them, they were all oxidized and unusable.
But in the very back, I found a relatively new drum.
When I opened it, there was a small amount of oil inside with little oxidation.
I scooped up the oil with the oil storage tank installed inside my arm.
Then, I returned the tank to its original location.
After a while, the oil was automatically extracted, improving the smoothness of the mechanical parts.
When I moved them, I could open and close my fingers without any dissonant sounds.
I was able to fix it.
Looking at my smoothly moving fingertips, I felt a sense of clarity spreading deep within my chest.
I put my gloves back on, returned the tools to my bag, and left the factory.
Outside, the wind had gotten quite strong.
I hope it doesn't rain...
I hurried back to town.
—On the way.
A white object had fallen to the ground.
It fluttered as if being toyed with by the raging wind.
After staring at it for a while, I realized it was a cloak.
With the nth flutter, I could see something wrapped inside.
It had the shape of a person.
Thinking it couldn't be, I rushed over to it, knelt down on one knee, and gently lifted the cloak.
There lay a young man with severe injuries.
The blood flowing from his wounded arm—I immediately knew he was human.
"A-Are you alright!?"
"Ugh... ugh..."
The young man groaned, as if reacting to my voice.
His body was painfully injured, and he didn't seem to be in a condition to stand up.
At the young man's feet were traces as if he had crawled there.
The traces were stained with blood, telling a story of hardship.
—I have to help him.
Something akin to a sense of mission seeped from within my chest into my entire body.
"Please hang in there, are you alright!"
I threw the bag I had slung over my shoulder onto the ground and helped the young man up.
Perhaps the movement caused him pain, as the young man grimaced and groaned even more intensely.
And then, as if clinging to something, he reached out his hand.
Without thinking, I offered my open right hand.
My mechanical hand was grasped through the glove.
I messed up—I inwardly cursed myself.
But the strength in his hand was so weak that, conversely, I couldn't shake him off.
The young man slowly opened his eyes and looked at me.
"Y...you... you..."
"A-Are you alright? There's a town nearby. I'll carry you there right away."
"T...town..."
He muttered, as if echoing my words with vacant eyes.
And then, as if confirming the hand he was holding, he traced the glove with his powerless fingers.
I'm sure he's realized it.
He must have noticed the hard texture, different from that of a human, through the glove.
But it doesn't matter.
This isn't a situation where I can worry about that.
"...D-Do you... l-live... in... th-that town...?"
"T...town... live...?"
The young man repeats "town" like a mantra.
The words are weak, as if they might disappear at any moment.
I decided to take this young man back with me.
Maybe, just maybe, I can save this person now.
I put his arm over my shoulder and half-dragged, half-carried the young man.
His steps were heavy, and it took a considerable amount of time to advance even ten meters.
But I wanted to help this person... I was filled with the desire to save him.
"You... since when... town...?"
The man, who looked like he was about to faint at any moment, asked me.
"It's only been about a week."
"I see... I... see..."
I could feel the young man weakening over my shoulder.
If I don't keep him conscious, he might not come back.
"Please hang in there, we'll be in town soon, very soon. It's not that big, but the people there are all warm and kind."
I desperately tried to talk to the young man.
If I could talk about something that would interest him even a little, he wouldn't lose consciousness.
"There aren't any doctors, but there are books, so I'm sure we can figure out how to treat your injuries."
"...B...books...?"
"Yes! We have everything. I'm sure we can look up anything. So please, hang in there."
"...Any...thing...?"
"Yes! For sure!"
The young man took a long, slow breath, then muttered softly.
"...Abandon me..."
I didn't understand what he said.
I stopped walking without thinking.
"...Me... Just leave me here... Abandon me..."
"T-There's no way I could do that!"
"I... was attacked by humans..."
"By humans...?"
"I was just... just traveling in search of an ideal... But, ideals are just... values..."
The young man took another long breath.
"Because of differing values... humans... clash, oppose, and fight... becoming cruel and... violent beyond measure..."
"T-That's not true! Humans are warm, and they can share many things, and support each other!"
"Ah, that is precisely the ideal..."
The young man exhaled all the breath he had taken, going limp.
"U-Um, please, hang in there! Please hang in there!"
I couldn't tell if he had just lost consciousness, or if...
Unpleasant thoughts swirled around in my head.
I gritted my teeth, looked straight ahead, and started walking towards town.
To help this person, even a second sooner.
Before I knew it, rain started to fall, striking our backs fiercely.
Rainwater seeped into my gloves, but I couldn't afford to worry about that.
I frantically carried the young man into the church.
"Rei, what's wro... Wh-Who is that!?"
Shiona greeted me, looking flustered.
"This person collapsed on the way! He's badly injured!"
"I understand. Carry him to the back."
Led by Shiona, I carried the young man to a room with a bed.
When I laid him down on the white sheets, the rainwater and blood on his body mixed, spreading into a red stain.
There was no sign of the young man regaining consciousness.
"Rei, I've brought some water."
I held the cup Shiona gave me to the young man's mouth.
I poured a little water in.
The young man's throat pulsed as he swallowed.
Even so, he didn't regain consciousness.
Compared to when I first met him, his complexion was considerably paler.
"Shiona, I'm going to the library! I'm sure there'll be medical books there!"
Shiona started to say something, then bit her lip.
I was concerned by her reaction, but right now, every second counts.
Ignoring Shiona, I rushed out of the room.
And without worrying about getting wet in the rain, I ran to the library.
"Rei, what's wrong? You're soaking wet."
Perhaps surprised by my sudden entrance, Tippy stared at me with wide eyes.
Without worrying about my ragged breathing, I asked.
"Tippy... are there any medical books here?"
"Y-Yes, there are."
"Please, can you take me there right away?"
"...Okay."
She must have sensed something was wrong.
Tippy immediately led me to the location.
"Is someone sick?"
Tippy asked, still facing forward as she led the way.
"Yeah... they're injured."
"Is it Rei? Shiona? Or...?"
"No, it's someone Tippy doesn't know. So, you don't have to look so sad."
"But... but, but..."
Large tears streamed down her cheeks.
That young man is someone Tippy doesn't know.
And yet, and yet...
To be able to shed tears for someone like that, what a kind child Tippy is.
"It's okay... it's okay."
I picked Tippy up and gently wrapped her in my arms.
I could feel her hot tears through my clothes.
I could feel a small ache deep in my chest.
Enduring that pain, I rummaged through the medical books.
But no matter how many books we have, we're just amateurs.
We don't know what the symptoms are, what kind of treatment to give, or even which book is correct.
I took as many books as I could carry from the library.
Not even caring that the books were getting wet, I returned to the church.
When I opened the door, a melody flowed out.
It was Shiona's singing.
That song alone was enough to recognize this as a sacred place.
"Shiona, how is he?"
"No... he still hasn't woken up. I've done everything I can, but..."
I ran to the young man's side.
The bandages wrapped around him must be Shiona's work.
But the young man's face was even paler than before.
I opened the medical books roughly.
I flipped through the pages, searching for anything we could do.
But we were far too reckless.
No matter how wonderful these medical books are, they're ultimately just bundles of paper.
There was no way we could save someone with medicine from the start, not with our lack of skill.
We were far too powerless, far too insignificant.
Shiona quietly began to sing.
Unlike usual, it was a quiet melody, like a requiem.
"...Hmm...this song..."
The young man opened his eyes to Shiona's song.
But his gaze was hollow, as if he were about to disappear at any moment.
"Do you know this song?"
"Ah, it's a nostalgic tune...I used to sing it often..."
The young man's gaze traced the ceiling, then turned to me and Shiona.
Suddenly, the young man's expression softened.
"...Ah, so it was here...the world I was searching for was here..."
"What do you mean? The world you were searching for, what exactly is it...?"
Perhaps the young man could no longer hear, as he didn't answer my question.
He just continued to speak unilaterally.
"...A path to coexistence...a world of harmony..."
After saying that, the young man quietly closed his eyes.
He didn't twitch or move after that.
I felt something spilling out from the depths of my heart.
"Hey, Shiona, why won't he open his eyes? Is he sleeping?"
"The power he had just obtained is also rapidly fading away..."
"Hey, I wonder why...is he just tired, maybe...?"
An indescribable sense of loss hung heavily in my heart like dark clouds.
A pain ran through me as if the depths of my heart were being churned up.
Shiona hugged me from behind.
Her warmth allowed me to calm down a little.
Naturally, I placed my hands over Shiona's hands that were wrapped around my chest.
"Shiona...I, I..."
"Rei...let's hold a funeral for him."
"A funeral...?"
"It's like a ceremony that's performed when someone dies."
"When someone dies..."
With those words, I realized.
Ah, this person has died.
"That's the only way we can mourn the dead."
I couldn't move, listening to Shiona's words.
I couldn't quite process the concept of death that had appeared before my eyes.
"Well, there are preparations to be made, so will you help me?"
I could only give a short nod.
We began to prepare for the funeral.
To mourn this young man whose name we didn't even know.
As we proceeded with the preparations for the ceremony, there was only one thing that bothered me.
I had left Tipi, who had been crying so much, in the library.
Was Tipi still crying?
In that dark library. All alone.
"Rei, what's wrong?"
Shiona spoke to me as my hands had stopped while decorating the altar.
"Yeah...there's something I'm a little worried about."
"Something you're worried about? What is it? Is it about that man?"
"No, it's not that...it's about Tipi."
"Tipi-chan? What about Tipi-chan?"
"When I went to get the medical book, I told Tipi everything about that person. And then, Tipi started crying...and the worst part is, I left Tipi in the library."
"You turned pale and left her there."
"Yeah, that's right. So, I was thinking that she might still be crying..."
"...Yeah, maybe. I'm sure she's crying in the back of the library."
I could easily imagine that scene.
Thinking about it, I couldn't stand still.
"Shiona, do you mind if I go check on Tipi for a bit?"
Shiona gave me a sad-looking smile.
"There's still a little more to do to prepare for the funeral. So, I'd be happy if you came back soon."
"Yeah, I know. I'll be right back."
"...Okay. See you later."
Shiona still gave me a somewhat sad smile.
I finished decorating the altar and headed to the library.
With the medical book I had borrowed.
I walked through the town, which had become a light rain, with an umbrella.
The town's appearance was somehow different than usual.
As if something important was missing, lost...
I ran through the town of loss and hurried to the library.
The inside of the library was enveloped in silence, as if blocking out the sound of rain.
--No, except for one thing.
The sound of a blue-haired girl sobbing from the back.
I followed the sound of the girl's crying.
The girl was in her usual place.
As usual, the girl was drawing pictures while shedding tears.
"Rei... Rei..."
When she recognized me, Tipi reached out her small hands.
As if in reply, I hugged her small body.
The moment I hugged her, her sobs grew a little louder.
"Rei... what happened to that person?"
I was choked by those words.
"Hey, Rei... Rei..."
"That person... hey... hey, hey..."
Silence had become the answer.
Perhaps Tipi understood everything, she began to cry loudly without holding back her sadness.
For that young man she had never met, large tears spilled down her face.
Ah, why is this?
What is this pain in my chest?
The depths of my chest are being stirred up into a mess.
It occasionally hurt and wounded my chest.
Surely it was something overflowing from the wound opened in my chest.
That heat is overflowing from my eyes.
Before I knew it, I was crying.
I was shedding tears for the death of a young man I didn't even know.
Ah, I see.
This is 'sadness'.
This is a blue emotion.
This is the emotion that Tipi always keeps lit in her heart.
It's such a painful and difficult thing.
Tears flow endlessly.
I don't know how to stop them.
--No, that's not right.
I didn't want to stop them.
I wanted to keep letting these overflowing hot droplets flow.
Surely these droplets are an act of healing sadness.
By letting the sadness accumulated deep within our hearts flow out, we maintain our hearts.
Thinking that, I felt that the weight accumulated deep within my chest had become a little lighter.
And at the same time, I also felt that the amount of overflowing tears had increased.
I cried.
We cried.
Letting out sobs, embracing each other, we cried.
Crying, crying, crying...
No matter how long it took, the tears never dried up.
As if sadness would never wither, the tears continued to overflow.
"Tipi, there will be a funeral soon."
"...A funeral? What... is that?"
"It's a ceremony to say goodbye to someone who has died. Shiona is preparing for it now."
"A goodbye...? What's a goodbye...?"
"It means you can't see them anymore."
"Can't see them anymore... No!"
Tipi clings tightly to me.
Her arms were trembling slightly.
"I understand how you feel, Tipi. But you know, that's precisely why we have to say a proper goodbye, I think."
"Because we can't see them anymore, let's say goodbye and see them off. Otherwise, I'm sure we'll be lonely and sad..."
"Lonely... sad..."
"Yes, I'm sure we will. That's why we're sending them off. So we won't be lonely or sad... Can you do that?"
Tipi slowly pulled away from me.
With tears still streaming down her face, she looked up at me.
"...I can. Tipi can do it."
"I see. That's great, Tipi."
When I stroked her head, she looked a little happy.
But the tears never stopped.
"Well then, shall we go...? Can you stand?"
"Yes... Just a moment."
Tipi stood up and picked up her teddy bear.
Her constant companion, her teddy bear, is still in her arms.
We held hands and headed to the church in the rain.
"Merciful God, our Father, we entrust to Your hands this young man who has finished his journey in the hope of eternal life, believing in Your only begotten Son, whom You sent."
"Take away all the burdens of this brother and sister who are leaving us, lead them to the dwelling prepared in heaven, and add them to the assembly of saints."
"May we, who are in the sorrow of parting, also be supported by the hope of the resurrection promised by the Lord, and may we share eternal joy with the child who has been called to You."
Shiona's voice echoed through the church, which was overflowing with attendees.
No one here should have ever seen that young man.
No one here should know that young man.
Even so, everyone who gathered here mourned the young man's death.
This is what it means to care for others, the connection between people, I thought.
Everyone clasped their hands in front of their chests, quietly closing their eyes and offering prayers.
Both Tipi and I followed suit.
Shiona's voice solemnly echoed through the church.
It was as if it were a song she was dedicating to the young man…
After the funeral, the young man was buried in the cemetery behind the church.
For one last farewell, the townspeople approached the coffin one by one, offering words of goodbye.
May you have a good afterlife…
Let's meet again someday…
Eternal rest…
They offered their respective words.
"Come on, Tipi."
It was our turn, and we approached the coffin.
Tipi stared intently at the coffin containing the young man.
The tears she had been shedding right up until the funeral were gone, and she just stared at the young man expressionlessly.
As if she had lost all emotion.
Just silently.
Staring intently, intently at the coffin.
Seeing this, I felt uneasy and tried to call out to Tipi.
But, a moment before I could, she opened her mouth.
She muttered in a small voice.
Several hours passed since then.
Light shone through the gaps in the clouds where the rain had stopped, which was rare.
It's unusual for sunlight to shine through the gray, cloudy sky.
But I wasn't captivated by the beautiful scenery.
Because I was concerned about the expression on Tipi's face during the funeral.
That expression that was too empty to be called sadness.
I don't know what it means.
Even so, there's only one thing I think.
I want to be by her side.
I want to be by Tipi's side and talk to her.
And I want to heal that sadness.
That feeling grows stronger within me.
Just as I was about to open the door to the room, Shiona stopped me.
"Yeah, I was thinking of going to see Tipi."
"During the funeral, Tipi looked so sad, I got worried."
"I see... but you know, I'm worried about you, Rei."
"Yeah. Because Rei, you have such a sad expression."
"Sad... ?"
I touch my cheek with my hand.
"You can't tell like that, can you? Here, come over here."
I was led by the hand into the living room and made to stand in front of a mirror.
"Look, you have a sad face, don't you?"
My face reflected in the mirror was... pale.
I understand now what Shiona always meant when she said Tipi was "pale."
Right now, I have the same face as Tipi.
My heart is quiet, but my body feels weak, and my expression is sinking as if pulled down by gravity.
"...Yeah, it's the first time I've seen my face like this."
This is... sadness.
Even without shedding tears, when you're captured by this emotion, your expression becomes so "pale."
"Someone died. It's only natural to have that kind of face."
