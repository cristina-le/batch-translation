I wished this moment could last forever and ever.
This time where we can bring smiles to people's faces.
And I wanted to keep watching Shiona's happy profile as she sang, forever and ever.
Suddenly, my gaze drifted towards the library on the edge of town.
I thought I saw the closed curtains sway slightly.
For a moment, I even saw a small figure.
I know who it is.
That blue-haired girl who's always crying.
It's Tipi.
She's probably still crying right now.
In that lonely library--.
Just thinking about it made a small ache in my chest.
It felt like a thorn had pricked me.
What must Tipi be thinking as she watches this circle?
This ever-expanding circle of smiles.
Everyone there was smiling and sharing the same feeling.
I noticed that there was one person with a scowl on their face.
That person with his shoulders squared and arms crossed is Mad.
He was so out of place, the only one with 'anger' written all over his face.
I suddenly met Mad's eyes, eyes that held an emotion I didn't yet know.
It was a time shorter than a second.
Mad harrumphed, turned on his heel, and disappeared into the crowd.
Watching him go, I thought.
I want to make everyone smile.
Those two expressing sadness and anger.
I want to make Tipi and Mad smile.
But, what should I do?
While turning the handle of the music box, I kept thinking about such things.
After the song ended, I headed to Mad's shop alone.
I couldn't shake the scowl he had on his face back then.
I cautiously stepped into the shop, which was as dim and eerie as ever.
There weren't any customers.
Only Mad was sitting in the chair at the register.
However, something was off.
Unlike before, he wasn't leaning back in his chair.
He was just staring intently at what looked like a small, rectangular chip in his hand.
His expression was still stern, but there was also a hint of loneliness about him.
"Um... Mad-san?"
When I called out to him, Mad hurriedly hid the chip in his palm.
"O-oh, what do you want? Why did you come in here without permission?"
"Without permission? It's a shop, so isn't it free to enter...?"
"Don't be ridiculous! You're an insolent brat to enter my shop without my permission!!"
I'm being told something very unreasonable.
"But, for Mad-san to not notice me coming in, you must have been really focused on that chip."
"I'm talking about the chip you're hiding in your palm."
"I'm not hiding anything!!"
"But I saw you. If you say you're not hiding it, then open your palm and show me what's in it--"
"Shut up and get out! And don't ever come back againnnnn!!"
As if pushed out by his words, I was kicked out of Mad's shop.
I came here to make Mad-san smile, but I'm doing the complete opposite.
Shiona was waiting for me in front of the shop.
Her smile warmed the depths of my heart a little.
"Huh? Why is Shiona here?"
"I was worried about where Rei was going, so I followed you."
"I came here to try and make Mad-san smile. But I just made him angry again..."
"Make Mad-san smile...? That's a very difficult thing to do. So don't worry about it. Mad-san getting angry is just a normal occurrence."
"But, today he seemed angrier than usual."
"More than usual? Did something happen?"
"I don't really know, but I asked him about the chip."
"...Chip?"
"Yeah, it was a square chip, small enough to fit in your palm. Mad-san was staring intently at it..."
I used my fingers to show Shiona the size of the chip that Mad-san was holding.
Shiona's eyes widened slightly, as if she knew something about the chip.
"Could it be that you asked him about that chip?"
"That's right. Then, he suddenly got angry--"
"Yeah, yeah, I see. Rei, it can't be helped."
"Can't be helped? What do you mean?"
"That chip is Mad-san's treasure."
"Mad-san's treasure? What's inside it?"
"It should contain a movie that Mad-san's son made."
"His son's movie? Is Mad-san's son a movie director?"
"Yes, he is. Although, he left this town a long time ago and hasn't come back since."
Shiona said, while looking towards the shop.
A strange expression, a mix of two emotions...troubled, but still with an unbroken smile.
"But, why is he just staring at the chip? He should just watch the movie."
"That's impossible. There's no equipment in this town that can play that chip."
"So, Mad-san is staring at it like that because he wants to see it but can't?"
"I'm sure that's it. He's shy, so he won't say it out loud, though."
At that moment, I had an idea.
A way to make Mad-san, who always has a scowl and is always angry, smile.
“No, it’s nothing. Shiona, I want to stop somewhere, so go on back.”
“Stop somewhere...?”
“Yeah, there's something I want to look into.”
“...The library?”
I thought Shiona looked a little surprised.
I wonder if she's worried about me, since I'm not used to the town yet.
“I definitely won’t be late.”
I said clearly, trying to ease Shiona's worries.
Shiona opened her mouth as if to say something, but closed it immediately.
And once. She bit her lip lightly for just a moment, then smiled.
“...Okay. Be careful, Rei.”
I parted ways with Shiona in front of Mad-san's shop and started walking through the town alone.
The inside of the library was as dim as ever, and the air was stagnant.
I headed straight through the maze-like interior without hesitation.
To the blue girl who is always crying--.
“Rei, you came.”
Tipi ran up to me as soon as she saw me.
I gently held her small body.
“Yeah, because I promised.”
“Thank you, Rei. I’m so happy.”
Tipi has her face buried in my stomach.
I could feel her tears soaking through my clothes.
“Tipi, what were you doing?”
“Drawing a picture. Come here, Rei.”
Taking my hand, Tipi led me along.
Where Tipi had been sitting, there were drawing papers and crayons scattered around.
In the middle of them was a half-finished drawing.
“Did you draw this, Tipi?”
“Yeah. I draw one every day.”
Tipi said, and then resumed drawing.
I peered into the picture.
There was a picture of a singing girl and a boy turning a music box.
“Tipi, could this be…”
“It’s Rei and Shiona. Singing in the plaza.”
So Tipi was watching us through the curtains after all.
Thinking of Tipi watching us all alone, for some reason, my chest ached.
“Rei, what’s wrong? Are you feeling bad somewhere?”
The eyes of the girl looking up at me were full of sorrow.
I placed my hand on Tipi's head, as if to comfort that emotion.
“I’m okay, it’s nothing. It’s a very good picture.”
“Yeah… thank you, I’m happy.”
When I pat her head, Tipi nuzzles up to me affectionately.
But her face is fragile, and sad--.
I truly wanted to see this child smile from the bottom of my heart.
“You said you draw one picture every day, but are there other pictures too?”
“Yeah, there are. Rei, come here.”
Tipi stood up, took my hand, and led me deeper into the library.
There, the pictures were.
Tipi must have put them up herself; several pictures were pasted on the wall in a low position.
“This is the picture I drew yesterday, this is the day before that, this is the day before that…”
Tipi explained each one to me.
A picture of a girl holding hands with a young man, looking happy.
A young man and another girl visiting the girl.
And then, a picture of a girl crying alone.
Ah, I see.
This is Tipi's picture diary.
From then on, there were pictures of a girl continuing to cry alone.
Since I came here, Tipi hasn't been alone anymore.
The expression on the girl in the picture seemed to have softened a little.
Surely that is Tipi's own emotion.
But it was still nothing more than something pregnant with sadness.
I wanted to make this girl smile too.
What can I do for that?
I can't think of an answer.
The only thing I can say is that I'll stay by Tipi's side like this.
“Hey Rei, what kind of book did you come to find today?”
Tipi, still with a sad look on her face, tugged at my sleeve and looked up at me.
“I'm looking for a device that can project images... do you know if there's a book about that?”
“Yeah, there is. It's a little far from here, though.”
“Will you guide me?”
“Yeah, okay. Here!”
And with that, Tipi spread her arms wide.
The bear plushie in her right hand dangled in the air.
“Carry me.”
I picked Tipi up.
Just like before, she rubbed her cheek against my chest.
“It's that way, Rei.”
And so, I began to follow her to the book I was looking for.
The book was on the second floor of the library--.
A corner of the shelf where materials related to images from all over the world, such as projectors and projection machines, were gathered.
“The book you want to read is definitely here.”
The books lined up on the shelf were all handwritten, just like the music box books and maps.
However, there seemed to be quite a few types of projectors, some using film and others using discs.
“What kind are you looking for?”
“I’m looking for something that can project a chip about this size, do you know?”
I used my fingers to show her the size of the chip that Mad had.
“Hmm… a square? Or a square with only one corner missing?”
“The corners… it felt like they were missing diagonally… I think.”
I hadn't looked at it very closely, so I couldn't say for sure.
But Tipi nodded slightly.
“That shape, is it Mad’s chip?”
“Yeah, it’s the chip Mad had.”
I was surprised that Tipi knew about Mad, but he was the owner of the general store in this town, so there was nothing strange about it.
Shiona knew about Mad's chip too, and maybe everyone in town knew.
And the fact that Mad was stubborn and wouldn't let anyone see what was inside was probably common knowledge.
“Um, well… if it’s that… then… this.”
Standing on her tiptoes, Tipi pointed to a book on the shelf that was just barely within reach.
“That’s amazing, Tipi. You really do remember the location of all the books, don’t you?”
“Ehehe~. I got praised~”
Tipi pressed her face against my stomach.
While patting her head, I picked up the book and checked its contents.
It was more like an instruction manual than a book.
“Mume Company Projector” – the types of reproducible media and chips were written in detail.
The internal structure and wiring were also carefully noted.
It seemed to be a projection-type player that could project content recorded on portable chips onto a screen or white wall.
If I could find this device, I could show Mad the movie inside the chip.
“Thank you, Tipi, I found the information I wanted.”
“…Are you leaving already?”
Tipi looked up at me with a sad expression.
“…Yeah, sorry.”
“Nooo~. Don’t go.”
Perhaps she intended to stop me from leaving.
Tipi hugged me.
That innocent warmth shook my resolve.
But I have to go.
Because right now, I want to make Mad happy.
Because I want to see Mad’s smile.
“Tipi, I promise. I’ll definitely come again tomorrow.”
“Tomorrow…? Really…?”
“Yeah, really. I promise.”
"...You won't disappear?"
"Yeah, I won't disappear. I'll come to see you every day, without fail."
"...Okay. I'll be waiting."
With lingering reluctance, I left the blue-haired girl—Tipi—behind and exited the library.
"You came back! What did you come here for!!!"
As soon as I entered the shop, Mad's roar greeted me.
I want to run away.
I want to cover my ears.
But, I didn't.
Because I wanted to fulfill Mad's wish.
"Mad-san, I have a request. Please lend me your son's chip."
"The chip that has your son's movie on it."
"Why should I lend it to you? Don't be ridiculous!!"
"Please... please."
"Enough with your meddling! It's a nuisance!"
"I... I want to be helpful to you, Mad-san!!"
"Helpful, you say?"
Mad's gaze sharpened even further, and a feeling of terror began to take hold, constricting my throat.
The movable parts of my knees lost their strength, and I felt a floating sensation.
I want to run away right now... but I can't hesitate here.
"I heard about the chip from Shiona. That your son left town to become a movie director. And that movie was sent from your son, right? But you couldn't watch it because you didn't have a playback device, am I wrong?"
I spoke quickly, trying to suppress my fear.
Perhaps taken aback by my momentum, Mad-san looked at me with a slightly surprised expression.
"I just went to the library. To find out what kind of device is needed to play it."
"You... you went to the library...?"
At the word 'library,' Mad-san looked even more surprised.
"Yes... I'll find a device that can play that chip. If the player is broken, I'll fix it. If I can't find one, I'll even build one by piecing together various parts."
"Why would you go so far? It's none of your business."
"It may be true that it's none of my business. But it's what I want to do."
"I want to be helpful to you, Mad-san... that's all. So, please."
Silence ensued.
Was this a silence of affirmation, or—.
"That guy was the worst, a complete idiot for a son."
Mad-san sat down in his chair and looked up at the ceiling.
Then, with a somewhat sad expression, he began to tell me his story.
All we ever did was fight.
Every time we saw each other, a fight would start.
So, at some point, he started avoiding me.
No, maybe I was the one who was avoiding him.
Anyway, we stopped seeing each other as much.
So when he came to me and said he had something to talk about, I was surprised.
“I’m leaving this town.”
“Leaving town? What are you talking about?”
“I’m leaving this town to become a movie director. I realized, I really love movies.”
“Stop talking about dreams and face reality. There’s no way someone like you can be a director. You can’t do it.”
“Don’t just assume it’s impossible! You won’t know unless you try!”
“I know. I’m your father. No one will watch a movie by a director without talent.”
“There are people who recognize me! I’ve been getting results! You’re just the only one who won’t acknowledge it!”
“I can’t even dream in a town like this!”
“A town like this? Say that again.”
“I’ll say it as many times as you want. I can’t stand a life where I spend my whole life in a town like this, in a shop like this.”
“You… enough…”
“I’ll say it as many times as I want! You’re just afraid of changing!”
“Ever since Mom died, you’ve been doing the same thing every day--”
Without thinking, I hit him.
“...That’s right, you always resort to violence. I’ve had enough.”
“...I see. Get out.”
“Yeah, I will. Keep doing the same thing here forever.”
My son left home.
And since then, he hasn’t even sent a single message.
The only thing he sent was this movie on this chip.
How am I supposed to watch it when I don’t have a device to play it on?
I can’t forgive him for being so selfish.
I don’t want to watch a movie like this.
I especially don’t want to see his face.
I was surprised at how unusually talkative Mad was.
The more I heard his feelings, the more my own feelings grew.
If Mad really hated his son, he wouldn’t keep a chip he couldn’t play all this time.
If his son hated Mad, he wouldn’t have sent him the movie he made.
I’m sure he wants Mad to see this movie.
I think he sent that chip to Mad with some kind of feeling.
That’s why I want to show this movie to Mad.
I bowed my head again.
“Please! Lend me the chip!”
Mad came in front of me in silence.
I was prepared to be yelled at, but I no longer felt fear.
More than that, my desire to be helpful to Mad was stronger.
But Mad handed me the chip he was holding.
“Do whatever you want.”
I stared at the chip I received once more.
It was a metal core covered in organic glass, with iridescent electronic circuits running through it.
I knew what it was. A general-purpose chip also used for Phyllod's memory backup.
It had become a global standard, and most manufacturers had adopted this format.
If that's the case, it might be playable even without a Mume Corporation projector.
I clenched the chip and bowed my head towards Mad.
A deserted factory on the edge of town.
I had set foot in a mountain of garbage behind it.
I thought that if there was any device to play Mad's chip, it would be in this abandoned factory.
If it were in town, he would have already played it.
There was a lot of equipment mixed in with the garbage.
Things with broken wiring, things that had rusted.
As far as I could see, it was all unusable.
The possibility of finding the projector itself in this place is low. But I think I can find some parts, like circuit boards.
That's right, just like I told Mad, I'll connect the parts and assemble something that can play the chip.
This is the only place I can rely on.
If I don't do something here, Mad will remain with that expression forever.
I won't let that happen.
I don't want that to happen.
With only that in mind, I began to dismantle the scrap heap.
But no matter how much I searched, I couldn't find the device I was looking for.
I'm sure Mad must have searched for one before.
No... maybe, Mad is still searching even now.
Shiona said that Mad fixes things he finds in this junkyard and sells them at the general store.
I wonder if his real goal was to find a projector to play his son's chip.
If that's the case, how must Mad feel, having been unable to find it all this time...?
Picking up something else in place of the projector... what was he thinking when he was repairing it...?
I broke Mad's clock.
Ah... I see... so that's why Mad was angry.
That clock was a part of the process for Mad to try and retrieve something important to him.
This is just speculation. But, I want to believe that's the case.
If that's true, then I won't be able to easily find what Mad has been searching for all this time.
Even so, I won't give up.
Finding the projector would be the greatest atonement I could offer Mad for breaking his clock...
It was when I dragged a piece of equipment larger than my body.
I felt a strange sensation in my right hand.
A very slight discomfort... I feel a stiffness in the movement of the joints in my fingers.
Has the oil run out, or has something broken down?
If I continue working like this, it might not be good.
I couldn't stop moving my hands.
Mad must have searched everywhere within my reach.
I look up at the mountain of scrap metal piled far higher than my own height.
Since I weigh less than Mad, maybe I can climb it.
Thinking that, I immediately started climbing the unkempt, awkward stairs.
I could feel water hitting my back.
Large raindrops were pouring down from the sky I looked up at.
"Rei, let's stop now."
A voice came from a position lower than my feet.
When I turned around, Shiona was there.
She was looking up at me, getting wet in the rain.
"It's raining. You'll catch a cold if you stay like this."
"I'm okay, I'll look a little more, thanks."
"Even if you don't find it, Mad will be happy that you tried so hard."
"I'm okay, Shiona. Just a little more."
I continued working.
From behind me, Shiona spoke to me unilaterally.
"But, you're already soaking wet. Let's stop. You're tired, aren't you? No one will blame you for giving up, Rei."
As if to soothe me.
"I'm worried about your body, let's stop, okay? I'll be sad if you get hurt, Rei... Giving up is also important."
"There might be other ways, so let's go home for today. I'm preparing orange fluffy soup."
"Let's go home... Rei, let's go home... hey, Rei... I'm worried, Rei..."
Even so, I continued.
Undaunted by the pouring rain, I kept searching.
I pulled out a rusted sheet of iron.
The moment I did, a small avalanche of scrap metal occurred.
I retreated, dodging the scrap metal that came crashing down at my feet with a deafening roar.
"Look out, Rei!"
I turned around at Shiona's voice, and a mountain of scrap metal cascading down from behind me came into view.
The mountain piled up behind me was also collapsing in the same way.
While almost being swallowed up, I somehow ran up the collapsing scrap.
After a while, the avalanche subsided, and only the sound of rain remained in the area once more.
"Are you okay, Rei? Are you hurt?"
"Yeah, somehow... That was close."
"Really... I'm glad you're safe, so glad..."
Shiona let out a sigh of relief.
As if to prove I was unharmed, I stood up.
"Ah... Rei, that."
Shiona pointed at my feet with wide eyes.
The mountain of scrap that had collapsed earlier. Within it, there was a piece of equipment I recognized.
It was the same equipment that was in the book Tippy had shown me.
I dug it out, and when I looked at the surface of the device, it had the faded letters 'Mume' written on it.
"I found it... Shiona, this is it! I found it!"
I lifted it up high so Shiona could see it.
The water that had accumulated inside flowed out as I tilted it.
"I did it, Shiona! I finally found it! Now Mad-san will be able to watch movies!"
"Yeah, but... I think that machine is broken...?"
"Huh?"
Shiona said that, and I brought the hand holding the device in front of my eyes.
Indeed, the device I found—'a Mume-brand projector'—had obvious signs of damage.
The lens needed for projection was missing.
Also, there was a large crack on the top, and when I peeked inside, the internal circuitry was covered in rust.
With this, it's impossible to project a movie.
"That's too bad... Rei, shall we go home now?"
Shiona offered her hand.
I placed my hand over hers.
Its warmth warmed my rain-chilled hand.
By the time we returned to town, the rain had stopped.
But the inside of my heart didn't clear up.
Can I really repair the projector I'm holding in my arms?
In my heart, I was determined to fix it, but now that I've witnessed how battered it is, that resolve wavers.
"What's wrong, getting all soaked like that?"
On the way back to the church, I was suddenly called out to.
When I turned around, the photography studio manager who had taken our picture before was standing there.
I was just looking for something.
Looking for something...? I see. So, did you find what you were looking for?
Yes... but...
Is something the matter?
We found it, but it's broken and unusable.
Shiona answered for me, as I was feeling dejected.
I see. That's too bad. By the way, what were you planning to use it for?
Actually... I wanted to play the chip that Mad-san has.
Mad-san's? The chip that was sent from his son, right?
...Yes. I wanted to make Mad-san, who's always angry, happy...
Is that something you truly want to do from the bottom of your heart?
The manager asked gently, yet probing.
Yes, of course.
I answered without hesitation.
Mad-san... always has an angry face and looks like he's in so much pain. I think if there's some kind of trigger, he'll smile. I think people can be happy if they can laugh. And I think other people who see that can be happy too.
After saying that much, I looked at Shiona.
I... learned that from Shiona.
Shiona looked surprised at my words, but quickly smiled.
Yes, that's the expression. Someone's smile makes the people around them feel happy too.
The moment Shiona smiled at me, my heart warmed up as well.
I see... could you show it to me?
The manager pointed at the projector I was holding. I silently handed over the broken device.
The photography studio manager carefully examined the device.
I see, this is terrible. There are too many missing parts to even try to fix it.
Hearing that from the manager, who always takes care of his cameras, made me feel discouraged.
Perhaps noticing my dejected mood, the manager returned the projector with a wry smile.
Let's go home soon, Rei? You'll catch a cold.
That's right. Staying wet in the rain is bad for your health. You should probably go home and change.
Any more than this and we'll just be bothering the manager.
Even if I'm okay, Shiona, being human, could catch a cold.
Hugging the projector, I bowed to the manager and we headed towards the church.
When we returned to the church, Shiona wiped my head with a fluffy towel.
Gently, softly, dabbing carefully so as not to rub.
That's too bad about the projector, huh?
...Yeah, but that place was originally a garbage dump, so it's only natural that it was broken.
Something I should have realized if I had thought about it a little. But I was hoping for a convenient turn of events.
That if I wished for it, something would happen. That if I worked hard, results would surely follow.
I'm reminded that reality isn't that sweet.
It can't be helped. You did your best, Rei, no one will complain.
But... but I wanted to show Mad the movie.
Yeah... Rei, you're so kind.
It's not kindness or anything like that. I just think it's my role.
But just that feeling alone will make Mad happy. That's enough.
I hope so...
For now, let's warm up, okay? I'll get you something to drink that'll warm you up, body and soul.
Folding the towel she used to wipe my head, Shiona smiled and headed towards the kitchen.
I sat down on a chair and sighed.
I look at the broken projector on the table.
...No, there's no point in being down.
Even though it's broken, if you think about it, we've made some progress from having nothing.
If I fix this projector little by little, I should be able to play the chip someday.
The book I borrowed from Tipi has instructions on how to disassemble it for maintenance.
If I unravel it in order, I should be able to fix it.
I can look for the missing parts one by one at that factory.
I want to see Mad smile. I want to see an expression of joy, like Shiona's when the music box was fixed.
I renew my resolve to fix the projector.
Just then, I notice that the church's main hall is getting lively.
Excuse me.
Opening the door and peeking out, I saw the photography studio manager.
And behind him, even more people from town.
What's going on?
I asked, puzzled, and the townspeople smiled as they offered me something.
This is a part from our broken clock. I thought it might be useful.
I thought this wiring might fit.
Use my light!
No, use mine!
We have plenty of tools at our place, so use as many as you need.
Various electrical components, wiring equipment, electronic circuits, gears, and screws were placed on the table one after another.
Unable to understand the scene, I was dumbfounded, and the manager smiled kindly.
...Um, what is this?
You're going to fix that projector, right? When I told everyone, they brought things that they thought might be useful. There might be some unnecessary things, but it's better to have materials than not, right?
But why...?
Everyone was moved by your and Shiona's music and song. They really wanted to thank you. ...I'm one of them too.
The manager took out a lens and handed it to me.
This... It's a camera lens, I wonder if it will fit?
I felt something warm deep inside my chest.
And that warmth gradually welled up, higher and higher.
Eventually, that warmth reached the depths of my eyes, becoming hotter and hotter.
The words wouldn't come together properly in my head. I wanted to say something, but only my lips trembled.
Shiona, holding a steaming cup, was watching me gently as I was in such a state.
Shiona... I feel warmth deep inside my chest. I wonder why.
Rei, that's an emotion called 'joy'.
As she said that, she approached me and handed me a cup filled with a drink that had a heart-warming aroma.
Everyone is responding to your desire to make Mad smile, Rei. Everyone is thinking about making Mad happy, with you at the center.
I wonder if I'm not being a bother... even though I started this on my own.
If they thought you were a bother, they wouldn't have such warm smiles on their faces.
I looked at the townspeople who had brought the parts, one by one.
Each of them held their respective parts, held them up so I could see them, and smiled at me.
...Thank you, everyone.
Using the parts and tools I received, I started the repairs on the spot.
I proceeded with the help of various people in areas that I couldn't understand on my own.
I removed the moisture, carefully scraped off the rusted parts with a file, and repaired the broken electronic circuits with copper foil.
I used the tip of a screwdriver heated until it turned red to correct the solder that was about to come off.
No, no, it's not like that, it's like this!
No, no, it should be like this!
You're both wrong! It's definitely like this here!
No, it's not like that, it's like this.
Noisily, but cheerfully, the repairs were carried out by everyone.
And then, finally...
The repairs were finished, in a patchwork, clumsy state.
Thank you, everyone.
It's nothing. But in return, let us hear that song again.
The children love it. Please do it again.
Listening to it with my boyfriend really sets the mood.
Listening to that song... it reminds me of the old days...
I love that song, it's so much fun!
A clumsy device made by everyone.
It looked nothing like the ones I'd seen in books.
But it was a one-of-a-kind projector, made by everyone.
I felt more joy than I ever had before.
Everyone there was genuinely happy about its completion.
All that's left is to test it out.
Hearing the words 'test run,' I looked around the room.
Come to think of it, I've never seen electricity in this town.
The photographer was using an analog camera, too.
...Um, is it possible that this town doesn't have electricity...?
At my question, everyone in the room suddenly looked startled.
It was an awkwardness, like I'd touched on something I shouldn't have.
