The girl was not where she always should have been.
Her bear plush, which she always kept close, wasn't there either.
All that remained were an unfinished drawing and crayons.
The unfinished drawing depicted a girl crying all alone.
Where could Tipi have gone?
I searched the surrounding bookshelves, but she was nowhere to be found.
Could she be somewhere in this library?
Or perhaps outside of it?
The truth is unknown.
I won't know until I try to find Tipi.
I started walking.
Weaving through the bookshelves, I searched for the blue-haired girl.
The vast library grounds were not suited for finding someone.
And to make matters worse, it was so dark.
Just looking from the edge of the bookshelves wouldn't be enough to find her.
I would have to check step by step, with my own feet.
I walked between the bookshelves from the back of the library towards the entrance.
Before I knew it, the clothes that had been wet were starting to dry.
And by the time my hair was completely dry...
I finally managed to find the girl.
The girl was on a large stepladder, arranging books on the shelf.
The girl is a resident of this library, and also serves as a librarian.
She must be returning the books that the townspeople have returned to their original locations.
It's a harsh task for this little girl.
The thousands of bookshelves in this library are stacked to the height of the ceiling and connected to each other.
I don't even want to think about the number of all the books in the collection, it's terrifying.
The girl faces such a large number of books and manages them like this every day.
All alone, inside this library.
Thinking about that, for some reason, I couldn't help but feel a tightening in the depths of my chest.
Tipi stretched on the stepladder, returning a book bigger than her face to the shelf.
After finishing that task and taking a breather, Tipi turned her face towards me.
"...Rei! ...W-w-w-w-wah..."
Noticing my presence, Tipi lost her balance on the stepladder.
"Look out, Tipi!!"
The stepladder fell over.
Tipi's hand reached out.
Responding to that hand, I stretched out both of my hands.
--The impact pierced through my chest to my back.
When I realized it, I was holding Tipi in my arms, having fallen onto the floor on my back.
"Rei... you came for me, Rei...!!"
Tipi was nuzzling against my chest over and over.
Relieved, I stroked Tipi's head.
Her soft hair welcomed my hand.
"Tipi, are you hurt anywhere? Are you injured?"
"I'm okay. Does Rei hurt anywhere?"
"I'm fine. Thank you for your concern."
"You saved Tipi... Rei, I love you..."
The little girl's hands gripped my clothes tightly.
I felt a slightly wet and warm sensation on my chest.
Tipi is shedding tears.
But they seemed like different tears than usual.
Surely, they are tears of relief.
I must be able to lighten Tipi's heart a little by being here.
Thinking that, joy rushed through me.
"Tipi was arranging books. I'm a good girl, right? Good girl?"
"Yes, you're a good girl. A very good girl."
"Hey, pet me. Because I'm a good girl, pet Tipi's head."
"Yeah... Tipi is a good girl, a good girl..."
I stroked her silky hair.
"Yay... Rei is petting my head. Tipi is so happy..."
"Do you always arrange books?"
"Yeah. I'm repairing the books. Because I want lots of people to read them."
I look up at the bookshelf.
Certainly, some of the books are quite old.
Some have worn spines, and others are discolored.
Tipi is repairing these...?
I remember wetting the books in the rain.
If I handle them roughly, I'll end up increasing Tipi's work like this.
I vowed from the bottom of my heart to treat them with care.
I sit up and lean my back against a nearby bookshelf.
"Sorry I'm late."
"It's okay... Rei came here like this, after all."
"Were you okay by yourself?"
"N-no... I was very, very lonely."
"Were you crying?"
"Yeah... yeah, yeah..."
Tipi presses her face against my chest.
Occasionally, I could hear her sobbing.
"It's okay, I'll be with you from now on."
"Always? Rei, will you stay with Tipi?"
"Yeah, that's right. I'll try to come to the library as much as possible."
"Won't you stay with me?"
Tipi raised her face.
Large tears were welling up in her eyes.
"That's a little difficult. I'm currently being taken care of by Shiona."
"But, I'll come every day. That should make you less lonely, right?"
"Yeah... but, the nights are so lonely."
"The nights, huh..."
"It's dark and quiet... Sometimes Tipi thinks she might be all alone in the world."
"That's not true. That's not true at all..."
All I could do was hug Tipi.
A sweet fragrance emanated from Tipi.
A sweet fragrance different from Shiona's.
"Yeah, I know... Just you coming here like this makes Tipi happy. Hey, Rei. Is it okay if I ask you something?"
"Yeah, what is it? Tipi."
"Will you help me?"
"Yeah... of course, it's the least I can do."
I stood up and took Tipi's hand.
Pushing a cart filled with several books, we strolled through the library.
"Next... um, a book called 'The Philosophy of Mind and Body'"
"If that's the one, it's Easy 493, third shelf from the top, thirteenth book from the right."
As soon as I said the title of the book, Tipi immediately spoke the location.
It was as if she knew every single book in this library.
In the place she told me, there was indeed a gap for one book.
When I inserted it, it fit perfectly.
Tipi wasn't just saying things randomly.
She was pointing out the location of the book with certainty.
I became interested and decided to ask a slightly mischievous question.
"Hey Tipi, can I ask you something?"
"Do you remember the opening part of this novel?"
What I presented was a rather old-fashioned novel.
Tipi stared intently at the title, and began to recite as if opening a book in her mind.
"'Looking down, there was a height of five stories. Cream-colored bricks were laid right next to the school building, creating a walkway that looked pleasant to stroll along. Right next to the walkway was a flower bed, and even from this height, you could see the colorful flowers. If I were to throw myself from here, would the cream color and the flowers all be stained with my dirty blood?'"
Tipi recited it word for word, without a single mistake.
It matched the handwritten text in the novel perfectly.
"Could it be that you remember all the books here?"
"Hmm... I don't know."
"Then, what about this book?"
After glancing at the book I presented, Tipi began to recite fluently.
"'The human body is composed of approximately 206 bones, starting from the head with the occipital bone, frontal bone, temporal bone, parietal bone, sphenoid bone, ethmoid bone, malleus, incus, stapes, inferior nasal concha, lacrimal bone, nasal bone, vomer, maxilla, palatine bone, zygomatic bone, mandible, hyoid bone, then connecting to the cervical vertebrae, thoracic vertebrae, lumbar vertebrae, sacral vertebrae, coccygeal vertebrae, ribs, and spreading to the sternum.'"
"...Then, what about this one?"
I presented another handwritten book, this one titled "The Complete Pi Encyclopedia."
"What's the opening of this 'Soulless Child Theory'?"
"'All things are finite, and even the soul is no exception. A child born after the soul has withered will be a soulless vessel. - Edward Morgue'"
Tipi has memorized all the books here.
But, why?
Even with an incredible memory, she would first need to read all these books.
Even if she read every day, she could never finish reading this sea of books.
What on earth is going on...?
"Rei, what's wrong?"
"No, it's nothing. Come on, let's put the next book away."
There's no point in thinking about something I can't figure out.
For now, I'll focus on helping Tipi with her work.
After returning all the books to the shelves, we sat down in our usual spot.
"Rei, thank you for helping me."
Tipi is being even more affectionate with me than usual.
Is it a reaction to not being able to see me until now?
The way she clings to me is cute and endearing.
"It's okay, Tipi. You always do this by yourself, right?"
"Yeah... I'm always, always alone. I'm lonely."
"...Since when have you been alone?"
That might have been a forbidden question.
Tipi looked up at me sadly.
"Tipi has been alone for a long, long time."
And then, Tipi told me her story.
A sad tale of how Tipi came to be alone.
"Papa, Mama!"
It was a story from when Tipi's parents were still in the library.
The girl loved them dearly.
She loved her kind mother and father so much.
Her mother was always smiling and would gently hug Tipi.
Her father was always organizing books, watching the two of them with a gentle gaze.
"Tipi is still such a spoiled child."
Her father took out an electronic device for books from the desk.
"Oh, that's right. Tipi liked this one better, didn't she?"
He put away the electronic device with a wry smile, and instead took out a "book" made of paper.
The technology of printing had already become obsolete, and now it was a precious cultural relic.
"Welcome, Tipi-chan."
Called onto her mother's lap, she happily sat down.
And on Tipi's lap was a bear plushie that her parents had chosen for her.
Tipi enjoyed every day.
She enjoyed the days she spent with her beloved mother and father.
And there wasn't a day she didn't feel happy.
Her mother always praised the pictures Tipi drew.
"She's sure to be an artist someday. I'm so proud, Father."
Her father always had hope for Tipi's future.
If only those days could last forever.
If only the three of them could stay together like this forever.
Tipi always thought so.
Before she knew it, the days when her parents frowned increased.
Tipi didn't like that expression.
The town also seemed restless.
The adults were all talking about something, all saying the same thing.
But the young Tipi didn't understand what it meant.
She only felt a growing anxiety that their life as it was would be destroyed.
One day, the phone rang.
To Tipi, that sound sounded very sad.
Her father, who answered the phone, began to frown.
That expression that Tipi didn't like.
Her father, after hanging up the phone, was talking about something with her mother.
After a while, that talk turned into an argument.
They were arguing about something.
The only thing I understood was that watching the two of them argue was very sad.
"Tipi, will you listen to me?"
After a while, her mother looked at Tipi with a serious expression.
Behind her was her father--and packed luggage.
Tipi intuitively realized that their life as it was would not continue.
"Right now, terrible things are happening in the world."
"Many people are scared and can't sleep at night. Tipi wouldn't want that, would she?"
"There are children all over the world who feel that way. Your mother wants to help them if she can."
"Yes... I knew Tipi would say that... So, Tipi, what I'm about to say is important. It's okay if you don't understand, but will you listen?"
"Actually, your father and I have to go far away to help those children. Even if we go, we may not be able to change the situation... But there is a possibility."
"No. Much, much farther. It's so far that it would take days or weeks to get there."
Her father stopped Tipi as she was about to go to her room.
"Tipi doesn't need to pack for the trip."
"That's not it... Actually, Tipi, your father and mother are going to that place alone."
"Alone...? What about Tipi...?"
Her parents exchanged glances.
Tipi sensed something from her parents' sad faces.
Suddenly, tears began to flow.
"I'm sorry, Tipi, but we can't do that."
"The place your mother and I are going is very dangerous. We don't want to take you to such a dangerous place. Your mother and father care about you, Tipi."
"No... I don't want to... I don't want to! Tipi's going too..."
Her parents gently hugged Tipi.
"I'm sorry, Tipi... But your mother and I still have to go."
"I'm sorry, Tipi... It'll be okay, we'll definitely be back soon."
"We'll be back really soon... So you won't be lonely, we'll come back right away..."
"Tipi, be a good girl and stay home. And show us your drawings again when we get back."
"Oh, that's right. Draw one picture every day. What you saw, what you heard, what you learned, what you felt. When we get back, will you tell us about it?"
"That's right. I'll also make a lot of stories into books on my trip. I'll come back to tell them to Tipi."
"Yes, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. I promise, so..."
The three family members hugged each other.
To heal the parting, which they didn't know how long it would last--.
How much time had passed since then?
Tipi continued to draw, just as her father had told her.
Each time she finished a drawing, she would stick it on the wall. So that her parents would see it right away when they came home.
What she saw...
What she heard...
What she learned...
What she felt...
But that was soon filled with thoughts of her parents.
I want them to hold me, to pat my head, to call my name, quickly... I want to see them...
My heart is dyed blue, a deep blue.
The girl continued to draw, tears streaming down her face...
Tipi told me about her sad past, shedding blue tears of sorrow.
Her small shoulders were trembling faintly.
A girl enduring sorrow before my very eyes.
I can't possibly fathom how great her sorrow is.
Probably because I've never felt such sorrow before.
That's why I can't understand Tipi's feelings.
But I should be able to heal her sorrow.
By holding her small body close.
Surely.
Tipi sat with her back against the wall.
I reached out to her delicate body.
When I touched her shoulder, Tipi's body jumped slightly.
It wasn't rejection.
She just seemed a little surprised by the sudden action in the darkness.
"It's okay, Tipi. It's okay."
"Hey, Rei, you won't disappear from Tipi's side, will you?"
"Yeah, I won't disappear."
"You won't leave Tipi alone?"
"Yeah, I won't leave you alone."
"You won't make Tipi lonely?"
"Yeah, I won't make you lonely."
"You won't make Tipi sad?"
"Yeah, I won't make you sad."
"You'll cherish Tipi?"
"Yeah, I'll cherish you."
"You'll hold Tipi close?"
"Yeah, I'll hold you close."
"You'll carry Tipi?"
"Yeah, I'll carry you."
"You'll pat Tipi's head?"
"Yeah, I'll pat your head."
"You'll hold Tipi's hand?"
"Yeah, I'll hold your hand."
"You'll stay with Tipi forever?"
Tipi's eyes glimmered faintly in the darkness.
The shoulder I touched was burning with a feverish heat.
I embraced Tipi tightly--.
"Oh, you two are getting along well."
The voice that echoed in the darkness didn't belong to the girl who was just trying to heal her sadness.
It was Shiona, who I was supposed to have parted ways with at the entrance.
Before I knew it, Shiona was standing beside me.
With a smile that I could make out even in the dim light, Shiona approached us directly.
"But you know, being too close is also a problem. You're a young man and woman, after all."
Shiona restrained the hand I had extended toward Tipi.
"Y-You're...".
Tipi's face, which had been seeking that arm, twisted in sadness.
I couldn't help but raise my voice at Shiona.
"Shiona, what are you doing!"
"What's wrong? Why are you so agitated? You have to consider the implications of physical contact with someone of the opposite sex."
"That's not it. Tipi is sad... I'm just trying to heal her sadness, even a little."
"Sad? About what?"
"About her parents not coming home yet! Tipi has always been all alone. She's been feeling lonely all this time!"
"That's reality, so it can't be helped."
"Can't be helped? What does that even mean..."
Shiona walked up to Tipi.
And then, she looked at Tipi, who was small and grieving.
"Tipi-chan? It's unfortunate, but Tipi-chan will always be all alone, you know? Always has been, and always will be."
She said that with a smile, in her usual tone.
"Shiona, what are you saying..."
"Tipi-chan, you understand too, right? Your mom and dad aren't coming back anymore, are they?"
"Shiona... stop it... stop saying such cruel things..."
"You've realized it already, haven't you? You just don't want to admit it."
"...No... no... I don't want to..."
"Tipi-chan's mom and dad..."
"...Shiona... stop..."
"Are already de──"
"Stop ittttttt!!"
My voice echoed through the library.
My whole body was burning up.
My breathing became ragged, and I felt a pain deep in my head.
My clenched teeth were also grinding and groaning.
My vision flickered, and I could barely stand.
And at the same time, I was certain.
My chest felt red and prickly. The feeling that Mad always had.
This is the emotion called 'anger'.
I'm feeling anger at the injustice happening before my eyes.
Now, the blue-haired girl's hope has been severed.
Tipi was hurt by Shiona's heartless words.
Tipi is crying with a voiceless voice.
Her face is all crumpled up.
Turning her sadness into large drops, letting them flow down her cheeks.
With her young body, she desperately conveys her bottomless sorrow.
Shiona added insult to injury.
"Because it's true, right? How long do you think it's been since your mom and dad came home, Tipi-chan?"
"Tipi-chan, you draw pictures every day, right? How many is it now?"
"Stop it..."
"Doesn't it make you sad to draw every day? How many more pictures do you have to draw before your mom and dad come back?"
"Sto-op it..."
"It's useless no matter how much you cry. Tears only flow to comfort yourself. Just because they flow doesn't mean anything will change."
"...Please stop..."
"That's just self-satisfaction. You're only crying because you know someone will be nice to you if you cry. That's just running away from reality."
"...Plea-se stop..."
"It's time you realized. Your mom and dad aren't coming back. Never again. Tipi-chan will never be able to see her mom and dad again."
"Also, let me tell you. Rei is only here because he pities you, Tipi-chan. He doesn't have the love that your mom and dad poured into you. Only pity is binding Rei here. Do you understand, Tipi-chan? You're all alone."
"Stop ittttttttttt──"
An angry roar echoed.
When that voice echoing off the walls stopped, only Tipi's sobs remained.
Tipi looks up at Shiona with vacant eyes.
I felt like the light she had just a little while ago had disappeared.
"Rei, spoiling someone and comforting them are two different things."
"That's not true... that's not true..."
"Rei, you need to accept reality too. Tipi-chan's parents are no longer in this world."
"No... that's not true..."
"Then why haven't they contacted her even once? Not even a single letter to Tipi-chan, who they doted on and loved so much?"
"That's... surely, they're just too busy to find the time to contact her..."
"If they knew the other person was worried, they wouldn't begrudge the time. Especially if it's their beloved child. The fact that they haven't means—"
"Stop it... please, stop it..."
"—Tipi-chan's mom and dad are already dead."
I froze.
Shiona's tone was as gentle as usual, and her smile was the same as always.
I wish she would have said it in a cold, emotionless voice.
In that abnormal atmosphere, I couldn't say anything more.
Shiona's face is smiling as she turns to face Tipi again.
"Tipi-chan, your only family is your mom and dad. But those two aren't coming back anymore. That's why no matter who you're with, you'll never be truly fulfilled. Even if Rei is with you, you can't become a family. That's an unchangeable fact now. You'll always be alone."
Shiona turns on her heel and heads towards the entrance.
On the way, she turns back towards me just once.
But her gaze remained fixed on the floor.
"Rei... it's all for your sake,"
Shiona said, leaving those words behind as she exited the library.
Silence filled the hall.
Now, even Tipi's sobs had ceased.
I was furious and drained by Shiona's words and actions.
I couldn't even stand up.
But I couldn't leave the girl alone like this.
The girl must be thinking.
That she's all alone in the world.
That she has to live in solitude.
I didn't want her to think that way.
I wanted her to know she wasn't alone.
My feelings for Tipi aren't pity.
It's definitely not pity.
I repeat it over and over again.
As if telling myself, over and over again.
I reach out and place my hand on Tipi's shoulder.
I pull her delicate shoulders close.
Tipi flinched at first, surprised, but then settled against my chest.
She presses her face against me, stifling her sobs.
I gently stroked her trembling shoulders again and again.
If only I could alleviate even a little of the sorrow she holds in that small body...
I don't know how long we stayed like that.
We sat there, nestled close to each other.
After a while, when I'd lost all sense of time.
Tipi got up unsteadily and started walking as if searching for something.
Tipi doesn't respond.
A sketchbook and crayons.
Tipi comes back to me with those two items.
She sits down, leaning her back against my stomach.
Tipi still doesn't respond.
Instead, she flips through the pages of the sketchbook.
Using the fresh page as her canvas, Tipi picks up a crayon.
And without hesitation, she runs the crayon across the paper.
What she draws is a cute, age-appropriate picture.
The first thing she drew was a picture of a blue girl.
There are tear tracks on her cheeks.
Her eyes are tinged with red.
I gently stroked Tipi's head.
Lowering her gaze again, Tipi runs the crayon across the paper.
Next, it seems she's drawing me.
My hand is placed on the girl's head.
It seems to be a scene of me gently stroking her head.
And then--
It was Shiona.
She's watching the girl from a short distance away with a scary look on her face.
That's what Shiona is to Tipi.
Even from my perspective, Shiona in front of Tipi probably looks like that in a picture.
Why did Shiona do such a thing?
Shiona said it.
That it was all for my sake.
I don't understand what that means.
No, I didn't want to understand.
I don't understand what 'for my sake' means when it makes Tipi cry.
Can I be happy by making someone else unhappy?
No, there's no way that could happen.
It's something that shouldn't happen.
As if to erase Shiona's words that are stuck in my ears, I hug Tipi.
Her voice is faint and about to disappear.
But deep down, I felt a little bit of joy.
I think as I look at the picture.
Could this be Tipi's way of avoiding sadness?
It's said that people dream at the end of the day.
That's said to be in order to organize the memories of the day's events.
For Tipi, maybe this picture is that.
The events of the day--
Including the good and the bad, she draws everything in a picture.
By doing so, she organizes her memories and calms her heart, perhaps.
In fact, Tipi's expression has softened somewhat.
As the picture progresses, her sadness eases.
As if she's handing over her sadness to the picture.
Tipi, having stood up, took my hand.
Following her lead, I arrive at a wall covered in pictures.
Pictures she says she draws one a day.
The number of pictures was enormous.
Tipi pasted the picture she drew today at the very edge.
Another picture of Tipi's has been added.
The wall full of pictures felt like a diary showing this girl's loneliness.
Tipi must have spent her time alone on this story.
To think she's been dealing with such a sad story all alone...
Thinking that, something welled up from the depths of my heart.
Looking into those sorrowful eyes, I unintentionally choked up.
Instead of answering, I embraced Tipi.
After a while, I could hear her soft breathing.
I compared Tipi, asleep in my arms, to the picture diary on the wall.
Could this picture book perhaps be Tipi's heart itself?
Thinking such things, I fell asleep.
This is the church where I live.
I stand before the familiar white, large doors.
I pushed open those doors with both hands.
The chapel that continues inside is enveloped in astonishing silence.
--No, it's not complete silence.
Because the sound of quiet sobbing reached my ears.
I push forward into the chapel.
Then, I came face to face with the person who was sobbing.
It was someone who never let their smile fade.
It was Shiona.
Shiona was crying, her delicate shoulders trembling.
I couldn't hide my surprise at that.
--Why are you crying?
I didn't understand the reason.
But, the fact is that Shiona is crying in front of me.
Those tears are not fake.
Even so, there was nothing I could do.
...No, that's not true.
There must be something I can do.
I reach out my hand.
My fingertips were reaching towards Shiona's eyes.
I don't think I can stop those tears.
But, I can wipe away the tears that have already fallen.
That's all I can do, but--.
I reach my fingertip towards a large drop.
Halfway there, my hand stopped.
My fingertips are made of machine.
The extended index finger has a metallic sheen...
That's right.
I had forgotten.
No, I wanted to forget.
I am not human.
I am a manufactured being.
Why is this happening?
Am I not even allowed to wipe away the tears of someone I care about?
Shiona is crying.
She continues to shed tears.
Is this a sadness that Shiona has never shown before?
But, I can't stop or wipe away those endlessly flowing tears.
Then, why am I here?
Being here, what can I do for Shiona?
I couldn't find the answer.
I couldn't move my outstretched mechanical hand any further...
--Immediately after, a dissonant sound of metal scraping against metal echoed around us.
The ear-splitting sound echoed intermittently.
Or so I thought, my outstretched fingertip--.
That part crumbled and fell to the floor.
The collapse, which began at the fingertip, increased its range to the palm--wrist--arm--shoulder.
Parts all over my body are collapsing and falling off.
Before long, it became difficult for me to even stand there, and I fell to the floor.
My legs, my torso, are turning into scrap.
Scrap metal is piling up around me.
I couldn't even make a sound, and had no choice but to accept the collapse.
Shiona is still crying.
Crying silently.
I can no longer even extend my mechanical hand.
Because there's no longer even an arm or fingertip there.
The collapse corrodes my entire body, reaching even my head.
I don't feel any pain.
I shouldn't feel any.
But...
I felt a pain deep within my chest, a chest that should no longer exist.
The last thing I saw as my vision crumbled away was Shiona's sad expression and tears.
Eventually, I became just a pile of metal--.
A mountain of scrap.
--And then, I woke up.
I was shouting something, but I don't remember.
My breathing is ragged.
I hurriedly looked around.
A dimly lit, dusty space.
The lukewarm air clings stickily to me.
And thick books lined up on shelves.
