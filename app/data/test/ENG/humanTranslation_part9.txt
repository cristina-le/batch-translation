So I realized I had to resist as well.
But even as I thought that... I couldn't stop myself.
I simply couldn't leave that sad girl in front of me alone.
I hugged Tipi close to me, and Shiona as well.
I felt heat behind my eyes.
I asked myself why I was doing this, even when I knew it would only shorten Tipi's life.
Was I just satisfying my own personal whim?
I really was a human after all...
A selfish human, acting only in my own interests and hurting others.
I held the two of them so tightly it hurt.
I pulled their warmth toward me.
We pulled in each others' warmth to fill a 200-year-long gap.
The warmth of our three bodies left no room for the cold of the facility.
We were that warm.
A melody started to slip from Shiona's lips.
The song her brother wrote.
A melody that would bring warmth to our hearts.
Her gentle singing voice echoed throughout the facility.
"I love it when Shiona sings this song."
Tipi buried her face in my chest.
"It reminds me of when Mama and Papa were here... And I dunno why, but I can't stop crying."
Tipi felt the same sadness all over again.
She had been feeling it for 200 years.
Perhaps there was no way I could wipe away 200 years of sadness.
But I was able to give her that one moment of warmth.
I put 200 years' worth of emotion in hugging them during that fleeting moment of warmth.
But that pleasant moment didn't last long.
"Huh... Tipi?"
I looked at Tipi where she sat on the sofa.
She was staring straight ahead into space.
"Hmm? Umm..."
She didn't answer directly.
But she didn't seem well.
Maybe it was relief from the earlier tension, or maybe she had walked too long.
Either way, it looked like she needed a rest.
"It looks like you're tired. Let's rest for today."
Tipi answered after a short pause. It seemed like she was thinking about something.
Then Shiona whispered to me so that Tipi couldn't hear.
"Rei, Tipi might be running out of energy. It could be making it hard for her to concentrate."
"I see... Then we'll have to charge her up. But wait, how do we do that?"
"It's a wireless charging system. The chargers here should be compatible, so first let's find a connector and charge up the teddy bear."
"Got it. If I find something that looks likely, let me know if it's the right thing."
"No problem."
We left Tipi on the sofa, and started checking all the devices in the facility.
There was cold sleep equipment everywhere. We looked for one that was still cold.
Then we opened the maintenance panel on its base, and looked for the power cord.
Soon, we found a connector attached to a thick cord that looked like a power cable.
"Yeah, this type will do. Tipi, hand me your bear."
Shiona took the bear from Tipi, opened the zipper on its back, and guided it towards the socket.
When she plugged in the charger cable, the bear's eyes flashed twice.
It must have been a sign that the charging had stated. Shiona gave a sigh of relief.
Tipi squeezed the bear's hand. Just that must have provided her with some electricity, as the light in her eyes seemed to grow stronger.
"Shiona, we should eat too."
I showed her the oral nutrient blocks I'd found while we were searching for the cable.
They were the same as the ones I'd found when I left the facility before.
"They don't taste anywhere near as good as your soup, Shiona, but I think they're nutritious, at least."
"Thanks. I was just getting hungry, so I appreciate it. Just knowing that I can eat now makes me all energized."
I laid out a set of travel dishes, and put the oral nutrient blocks on the plates.
I figured that would make it seem a bit more like a proper meal.
At a time like this, I wanted to make even the smallest details feel as close to normal life as possible.
I wanted things to be as close as possible to what they had been in town - in Shiona's home.
"That looks delicious."
Shiona must have noticed how I felt, and she smiled.
We clasped our hands in thanks before eating.
Tipi noticed, and came over to us.
She put her bear down in front of her and clasped her hands in the same way.
"All together."
"Haha, you had an impressive meal, Tipi. A really extravagant one!"
My laugh was contagious, and Shiona started laughing too.
Tipi smiled bashfully.
In the midst of such difficult times, it felt good to relax like this.
I'm sure that long ago, we humans lived together with Phiroids as partners like this.
We should be able to live like that even now.
Just as they had taught me after I forgot how to feel... we should be able to recover that time we'd forgotten.
That's what I was thinking as I put the last of the oral nutrient block from my plate in my mouth.
Just then...
"Warning. Main battery dead sectors exceed 90%.Please replace battery as soon as possible."
Tipi suddenly spoke out in a business-like tone.
"Requesting replacement from Service Center -- Service Center is offline. Reconnecting. Service Center is offline. Reconnecting. Service Center is offline. Reconnecting..."
"Shiona, what's going on?"
"I'm not sure exactly, but it looks like Tipi's battery can't be recharged now."
"Can't be recharged...?"
Was the voltage wrong? But that shouldn't have been a problem, since it was going through the teddy bear.
So was there a problem with the battery itself?
If that was the case... maybe it had just degraded over time. When I thought about it, that battery had been in continuous use for 200 years.
It would be no wonder if it were all worn out.
"We might need a new battery..."
"A new battery... In Tipi's time, batteries couldn't be replaced without an expert to disassemble her first!"
"That can't be..."
I felt a bead of sweat roll down my back.
Did this that mean Tipi was going to stop functioning? That she was going to die?
"No. We've come so far!"
"It's alright... I already knew."
Tipi's voice had returned to its usual tone, but the two of us could only stare at her in shock.
"Tipi, you knew this might happen?"
"Yeah... Ever since we left the library, I thought this would happen. I noticed 6,427 days ago that my battery was charging less efficiently."
Tipi smiled weakly.
"But I need to do what I can... Rei, will you bring me the metal briefcase I was carrying?"
Tipi had been carrying a slim but oddly rugged metal briefcase since we left the library. It was heavier than I expected when I picked it up, and I put it in front of Tipi.
Tipi casually placed her hand on the middle of the briefcase. In response, two locks on the side with the handle came unlocked.
Tipi watched the locks open, and then slowly opened the briefcase.
Inside was a single black panel. It was about the size of a large book. But it was much thinner, only half the thickness of a short picture book.
Tipi took it out carefully with both hands, and slowly turned it to face me.
"Rei. Put the palm of your hand here. Not the metal one."
I did as Tipi said, and put my non-mechanical hand on the pitch-black panel. And then...
"Biometrics confirmed. Warning. Registration applicant is human, not Phiroid. Registration is possible, but not recommended based on lifespan. Continue?"
A smooth male voice played out of the black panel.
"Current administrator, Voltex MSK-3737 Model Name 'Dorothy' Unit Name 'Tipi', approves operation. Continue registration."
"Confirmed. Registration applicant, please give unit name."
"Uhh... Rei."
"Confirmed. 'Rei' registered as new administrator. User instructions will be given verbally by former administrator. Operation complete."
After that, the black panel fell silent.
"Tipi, what was all that?"
"It's a digital version of all the books in the library. Back-up data of all of my memory."
Tipi answered in a tone that sounded both tired and somehow satisfied.
I thought back on all the hand-written books in the library.
Tipi remembered each of them word for word, without any mistakes.
Maybe Tipi had written them herself after all.
Just in case she stopped functioning... Or maybe she knew she'd stop someday, and wanted to preserve records of the past.
That place wasn't a library. Tipi herself was the library.
"When you use it, put your hand on the center like you just did. When you do, the tablet... the panel will light up. Then when it recognizes your voice, you can access all the data."
"In that case..."
I did as Tipi said to boot up the panel she called a "tablet." I placed the palm of my hand on its center.
"Biometrics confirmed, administrator Rei recognized. What data do you wish to load?"
"A manual! How to fix a Phiroid... Um, how to change a battery!"
"Beginning search... Search results for Phiroid repair include 124,751 hits in 3,195 items. Recommend narrowing search."
"Among those, find Voltex MSK-3737 Model 'Dorothy'."
"Beginning search... Results found."
The tablet's screen lit up brightly. Then words started to form on it.
"It is nearly impossible for a user to fix this unit. Please keep it safe until a staff member from the Service Center arrives."
My vision started to go dark.
"So, is it working well?"
"Yes, it's working... but..."
"That tablet... will only work... for about 50 more... years..."
That was plenty of time for me, but for a Phiroid or a library system it must not have seemed long.
"Are you sure it's okay for me to use it?"
"I want you to use it. Because... Soon, I won't be useful anymore..."
"Don't say that! You've helped me constantly up until now!"
When I fixed Shiona's music box, and when we fixed Madd's projector. I was able to do what I did because Tipi remembered everything in the library, and showed it to me.
"I'm glad you think so, Rei... Please use that from now on..."
From her sitting position on the couch, Tipi slowly moved to lie down.
We called out desperately to her, and Tipi's nearly-closed eyes slowly opened up again.
That's right, Tipi.
You've waited 200 years.
It can't all end yet.
Tipi's little mouth opened and closed.
It seemed as though she was trying to say something, but her voice was so quiet I couldn't hear.
I brought my ear close to her mouth.
"Hey, Rei... I had fun."
I put my hand on Tipi's.
Such a small, soft hand.
"You were like my father, Rei, and Shiona was like my mother... You were my kind, wonderful family."
No matter how cold we acted, or how much we pushed her away, we couldn't hide our true feelings.
And Tipi had noticed.
She knew how much we cared about her.
From the moment we met her, this was bound to happen.
There was nothing we could have done about it.
The only way for Tipi to survive was to live alone forever.
But of course that wasn't possible.
Tipi had feelings.
We weren't perfect enough to ignore sadness.
Maybe that wouldn't have been perfection anyway.
Being able to feel sadness was one of the reasons we were able to feel at all.
Like a handkerchief sinking bit by bit into water, Tipi's eyes closed.
I couldn't stop them.
Even though we had created Phiroids, we couldn't save them.
We just created them, and couldn't do anything more.
Humans were selfish to their cores.
"Hey, Shiona..."
Tipi's eyes fluttered slowly open again. But the light had already left them. She probably couldn't see anything, by that point.
"I'm here... I'm here, Tipi..."
Shiona's voice was shaking a little.
"I'm glad... Shiona."
"Thank you for everything. You worked hard to keep me from breaking, right?"
Shiona drew in her breath, as though preparing to scream with anguish.
"I think you've realized already, but it's been over 200 years since I started up... But I was only built to last 150 years. So you and Rei didn't do anything wrong. This would have happened anyway..."
When Tipi left the library and came to the church, Shiona apologized to Tipi, and Tipi forgave her.
So this was what that meant...
"So please. Shiona, don't cry... Please... Please sing..."
"Yes.... Okay!"
"I... love your song... Shiona."
Shiona started to sing. Sometimes she would let out a hiccup, interrupting the rhythm. But she kept singing. That melody...
"Thank... you..."
Tipi smiled... and then stopped moving.
My hands were shaking.
And not just my hands.
My whole body was shaking.
Just then, on my lap, a little life had ended.
Maybe some people would say Tipi's wasn't really a life.
But to me, it was a truly irreplaceable life.
Shiona continued to sing quietly.
The rhythm didn't falter after that. It sounded just like always, except that now the song rang out more clearly than ever.
This song was for Tipi.
Something hot ran down my cheek.
It ran down my chin, and fell onto Tipi's cheek.
Tipi wasn't crying, but it looked as though she was.
I held Tipi close.
Her small body would never move again.
Her little mouth would never speak again.
Her hands wouldn't draw anymore.
That was what "death" meant.
I felt a warmth spread through my head.
Shiona held me.
And my eyes grew hot.
These were my overflowing feelings. Unbearable pain and loneliness... This was extreme sadness.
For the second time in my life, I shed "tears."
Tears for Tipi.
After that, our lives changed dramatically.
I now had the electronic device that Tipi had given me, full of all the information in the library.
Thanks to this thing once called a "tablet," my knowledge quickly increased.
I learned how to grow crops, how to make houses from just stone and mud, how to predict the weather, and what many animals and plants that we could no longer see looked like.
And there was a database of 350 years' worth of newspapers, up until the time the library stopped working.
I was sure that if I searched, I could even find something about myself.
"Are you studying again today, Rei?"
"Yeah. There's so much I have to learn."
"What sort of book are you reading today?"
"A book about survival; how to survive in any environment."
The cold sleep facility didn't have that much electricity. But since there was a little, we had to learn how to make what there last.
We'd already addressed the facility's greatest weakness, a lack of drinking water, by collecting dew in the mornings and evenings.
We couldn't just get by on effort and brute strength anymore.
We needed knowledge. With knowledge, even a single person could stand up to a large group of people, or find a way not to face them at all... Or in other words, win.
It might even have been possible to save the townspeople.
I was insatiable, trying to absorb all the "power" that Tipi left me.
While I read, Shiona sang to the unmoving Tipi.
Among the things we'd brought from the town was Shiona's brother's music box.
Sometimes, instead of singing, Shiona would turn the handle to play the gentle melody.
It was a peaceful and comforting time.
With my newfound knowledge, I could probably live here with Shiona forever.
But... I didn't notice.
That there was something changing in Shiona...
"Rei, the food's ready."
Shiona had prepared our food with a smile, as always.
She had dissolved the oral nutrient blocks in water, making them more like soup.
It looked a lot like the orange powapowa soup that Shiona always made me back in town.
"Thanks, this soup always cheers me up."
"And it cheers me up to hear you say that. It makes my heart orange."
"But you don't have much soup, Shiona."
She had less than half as much soup as I did.
"I'm a Phiroid, so when I'm in power saving mode, I only need about this much."
"Yeah. So eat up, Rei. You can't be your best if you're hungry."
Ahh... Why didn't I notice?
Why didn't I doubt her words?
Even then... Her Phiroid functions were already in decline.
With half as much energy as me, she could only function so much.
I was reading as usual, and Shiona was singing.
I ran my fingers over the tablet, trying to think of a way to free the townspeople.
Then, the pleasant rhythm of the song suddenly stopped.
I looked up, wondering what happened, and Shiona was still, her hand pressed over her mouth.
The music box in her hand had stopped.
"Shiona...? What's wrong?"
"Umm... No, it's nothing. I just couldn't..."
She spoke for a moment, and then took a deep breath.
Then she started singing again, but...
"...Wait, huh? Am I off-pitch...?"
"Shio... na...?"
"Haha... That's so strange! I love this song so much! Just a second, it'll come back to me..."
Shiona closed her eyes, and tried over and over again to pick up where she had stopped singing.
But the melody that came out was completely different from the one I knew.
"I wonder why... I can't remember my brother's song at all..."
"Shiona!? Does anything feel wrong!?"
I was a fool. I had only been thinking of myself.
Shiona was so kind to me, and cared so much for me, I was satisfied with that and let her spoil me... I didn't think of her at all.
Even though when we left the village, she'd been hit by an explosion that blew off her arm's artificial skin.
"Shiona! Were you actually badly injured in that explosion!?"
Shiona thought for a moment, then shook her head.
"No, that wasn't a problem."
Shiona... No, Phiroids didn't lie.
But sometimes they hid things for the sake of humans.
If she said it wasn't a problem, then she must not have been damaged in the explosion.
Just as she said: not by "that."
"...Shiona. Show me what's not working properly."
At my urging, Shiona hesitated just for a moment, then nodded.
Shiona started undoing the buttons on her blouse.
Embarrassed by her sudden movement, I tried to look away, but then I saw something I couldn't help but stare at.
On Shiona's pale chest...
There was a small hole.
Forgetting that this was a woman's body, I moved closer to the wound.
It was clearly externally inflicted. The man-made skin around it was slightly scorched.
It was a gunshot wound.
I remembered the time at Madd's shop, when she protected me from the humans.
"It... hit you..."
"I thought I'd be fine, but apparently I was wrong."
Like a little kid who'd just been caught playing a prank, Shiona stuck out her tongue a bit and smiled.
I could tell she was smiling to protect my feelings.
Even then, she was thinking of me.
"Ngh... Search! MODA-117 Alice mk-17 Maintenance Manual!"
The tablet lit up in response to my voice.
But Shiona covered the screen with her hand. Then she slowly shook her head.
She still hadn't stopped smiling.
"It's my body. I know it better than anyone."
"But... there might be a way! If you'd told me sooner..."
But no, there was a reason she hadn't said anything.
Shiona knew that she had suffered a fatal wound that couldn't be fixed.
It was a reality that no struggling of mine could fix.
She wouldn't have wanted to put that into words.
I could see the word "death" in my mind.
I didn't want to think about it, but I couldn't stop.
"I can tell. I'm going to die soon. Or, since I'm a Phiroid, should I say 'break' instead?"
No, Shiona.
You're not going to break.
You're going to die.
"Haha, guess I wasn't concentrating hard enough. I feel weak all of a sudden..."
Just as I noticed her shoulders slump, Shiona started falling to the floor.
I rushed to catch her, and held her in the most comfortable position I could.
Shiona's body had once been so warm, but now it was cold.
How long had she been like this?
Why didn't I notice...?
"If I break... will I not be me anymore? But maybe you could fix me?"
"You're okay... You're you, Shiona..."
"Hahaha... Um, right now... I'm a little bit scared..."
"Shiona... Shiona... Ngh..."
"Don't cry, Rei. Tipi would laugh at you."
Shiona reached out to touch my cheek.
The tears she wiped away with her fingers were only the third I had shed.
"I don't want you to turn blue, Rei...I want you to stay orange and powapowa forever..."
I was so sad.
An unbelievable sadness was welling up inside me.
It grew so huge inside my heart, I couldn't hold it all.
With each moment, it grew darker.
Why was I sad?
The answer was simple.
Because she was important.
She was important to me.
Even if another Phiroid that looked exactly like her appeared in front of me, there would be no point.
It wouldn't have to look like her.
As long as it was her inside, that would be enough.
"Rei... I thought of you as my family. It was partly because you looked like my brother, but that wasn't all. It's because you were important to me."
Those are people you help out no matter what, even when there's nothing in it for you.
But there was a real feeling there too.
That was "love."
The feeling I had once longed for.
At some point, I noticed that feeling.
I'd had it... I'd had it all along.
Just by living, and going through life with someone, it was the most natural feeling in the world.
"What is it, Rei? Don't look so sad... Come on, let's sing. We'll go to the plaza again... Everyone will be so happy."
"We promised everyone, remember? You made everyone smile, Rei. You made them all happy."
Shiona's eyes were looking somewhere far away.
Back to memories of when she was happy. Memories of the fun days we spent in town.
Perhaps her memory was deteriorating.
But still...
"...Yes, let's sing. Everyone's looking forward to it."
I cranked the handle on the music box on the floor.
The melody started playing quietly.
Shiona smiled, closed her eyes, and started to sing.
I closed my eyes too, listening to the melody and thinking back.
Back to the short time I'd spent in that town.
The people walking down the streets had stopped, and looked our way.
One by one, they gathered in the plaza.
A child, an old man, someone's mother, someone's husband, all the townspeople had started to smile.
They were all enraptured by Shiona's song.
I'm sure that long ago, a scene like that was nothing out of the ordinary.
Humans and Phiroids smiled together, side by side.
We had just forgotten... We had lost what once was ordinary...
"Hey, Rei... Always, always, keep smiling."
"You can be sad, and you can be angry...But after that... After that, smile."
"You know... If love had a shape, I'm sure it would be round. After all, love could never hurt anyone."
"Yeah, you're right."
I held back my tears and smiled.
"And... If love had a temperature, I'm sure it would be warm. Because love wraps us up and warms our hearts."
"Yeah... I'm sure you're right."
"Because we have love, Rei, you can't be sad. Because love protects. It won't hurt you, Rei. I promise. No matter what happens after this, our love will protect you, Rei."
I had cried so many tears my eyes hurt.
My vision blurred.
But Shiona's smile was the one thing I could still see clearly.
"So don't cry. Love is always by your side. Love lasts forever. You don't have to cry. Because it's eternal."
I put my hand over Shiona's on my cheek.
It was warm, but had almost no strength left in it.
It was as though something was spilling out of her hands.
I knew what was spilling out.
But I didn't want to admit it.
I held her hand tightly, begging it not to spill away completely.
I could hear a song.
The warm melody that Shiona was always humming.
It slipped into my heart, which was starting to cloud over, and filled it with warmth.
"I'm sorry to leave you all on your own again."
"...! No. You're not doing that!"
I wanted to tear my hair out.
I finally realized.
I wasn't afraid of Shiona breaking. I was afraid of being alone again.
"You... you gave me so, so much, Shiona... Ngh...!"
I took Shiona's mechanical hand with my human one.
"Shiona, you taught me how to feel. I wasn't a human or a Phiroid, but you made me into a real human..."
It was true. Until I met Shiona, I wasn't really a human or a Phiroid.
But Shiona stayed by my side, and I was able to become human.
"You'll always be here inside me, Shiona. I'm not alone anymore. Happiness, sadness, anger... I got it all from you. I'll never forget."
Ah... It was no use. I should have been smiling.
Although I should have been doing my best to give Shiona peace of mind, my feelings were not going to allow that...
No matter how hard I tried, the torrent of sadness inside me began to overflow, as tears.
"So Shiona, don't look so sad. I'll be fine. I swear I'll be fine."
"I see... I'm glad."
Shiona nodded, looking satisfied.
Shiona narrowed her eyes, seemingly confused. Clear droplets began to fall from her eyes, as though they were being squeezed out.
"Oh no... I'm not feeling blue, but I'm crying... I really am broken..."
"No, that's not it..."
I spoke in a trembling voice, smiling to comfort Shiona as I spoke.
Now that I was human, I knew the meaning of those tears.
Shiona seemed to realize too, and smiled back at me.
"We cry... when we're happy too, I guess."
The strength slowly left Shiona's body.
Was I smiling? Was I managing it?
Was I managing to keep up a smile, to keep Shiona at ease?
"See... you..."
"...Yeah, see you."
Shiona closed her eyes.
And for just the slightest instant...
For just that tiny moment her face was the most beautiful I had ever seen.
Shiona's eyes never opened again.
Her tranquil expression looked as though she was smiling.
Almost like she was wishing me happiness.
But there could be no happiness in a world without Shiona.
My life from then on could have been nothing but pure hell.
Could I even stand it?
...No, I had to stand it somehow.
My chest felt so tight it hurt.
All of my emotions coursed through me, in conflict with each other.
My heart was so fragile and weak.
And losing someone special hurt so, so much.
"Uwah... Aaaah...!!"
My vision went blank, and I screamed enough to shatter the world around me.
Shiona had told me...
Love lasts forever.
Shiona's love may indeed have been eternal.
But I couldn't bear it.
I understood, this was what feelings were.
These feelings Shiona gave me.
This pain and loneliness as well.
But they weren't all.
It was only a little, but there was warmth left in my heart too. And I could say with confidence that the days we spent together had been fun.
Shiona had given me all of that.
And all of that was mine.
I couldn't let go of any of it.
How much time passed?
How much time could a human need to calm and collect his feelings?
I thought back again and again to when I first met Shiona.
About the meals we ate together.
Waking up and greeting each other in the morning.
Shopping together.
The time I went to the abandoned factory and worried her.
How happy she was when I fixed her music box.
Singing in the plaza, surrounded by smiles.
We promised...
I learned warmth.
I learned happiness.
I even felt anger.
I cried from sadness.
And... I found love.
No... It was all love.
This tragedy was brought about by foolish humans who had lost their ability to love.
Humans were so unbelievably self-centered.
They did the same things over and over again...
But they still needed someone.
That must have been instinct. When I woke up here, I wanted to meet a human.
It was my instinct to wish for someone to share my time with; to wish for love.
And I couldn't even recognize something so simple...
I looked at the cold sleep equipment in front of me.
I found some that were still functioning properly, and put Shiona and Tipi in them.
The equipment was made for humans, but it should have been able to keep them from degrading as quickly.
I wanted to keep them as they were, for as long as I could.
They looked almost as though they were sleeping when I stood before them and whispered.
"Shiona, Tipi... I'm leaving now."
There was no reply.
Of course there wasn't.
But I went on.
"I'm going on a journey. Don't worry. I do have a goal. I'm going to look for a world where humans and Phiroids can live together."
That was also what that young human man had wanted, before he was killed.
In a world where humans and Phiroids could live together, this sadness wouldn't happen.
Nothing could make me happier than a world where humans and Phiroids could live together.
So I was going to go look for it.
"And if there is no such world..."
I wrapped my human hand around my metal fist.
"...No, it has to exist. The world you tried to leave for us humans must exist."
It would probably be incredibly difficult to find it.
But I had the knowledge Tipi gave me.
And I had the feelings Shiona gave me.
Somewhere in this world was a partner who could continue teaching me how to love.
So this journey wouldn't be a hopeless one.
"I'm borrowing this. I'll come back someday to return it."
I was holding Shiona's brother's music box.
Standing in front of Shiona, I turned the crank and played the peaceful melody.
I felt like I could hear her singing along.
"Well then, I'll see you later."
To find a world where humans and Phiroids walked hand in hand...
I took my first step.
"Even so, I remained hopeful and continued to reach both arms toward the light."
"Are you awake?"
"Where... am I?"
"You've awakened from a long sleep. Do you know your name?"
My name...
"I'm an Aso International MODA-117 Alice mk-17. No individual unit name has been set."
"I see you've restarted with your default settings. You can stay Alice for a while, I suppose."
The man in front of me held out an old wooden box.
"What's this?"
"It was with you inside the cold sleep equipment you were resting in."
I took the box. It felt so familiar.
I opened the lid, and saw a dull gold disc. I tried turning the handle on the side of the box, and a melody with rich tones started playing.
The device gently plucked a metal comb, giving off a beautiful melody.
"It's that song that's been around forever, isn't it?"
This tune was not saved in my memory.
At least, it shouldn't have been, but it felt so familiar, and so warm, it warmed my heart.
And at the same time...
