I was in the library.
I had fallen asleep, and today was a new day.
I rushed to take off my glove, to see if my right hand was still there.
Thankfully, it was still intact. The dream hadn't come true.
But my hand was still a machine, just like in the dream.
Tipi was still sleeping peacefully on my legs.
Her peaceful expression in sleep gave no hint at her despair the night before.
It seemed I had experienced what would've been called a dream, for a person.
During sleep mode, I could sometimes see past memories as my memory banks were organized.
Perhaps what I saw was something like a prediction based on experience and memory.
Perhaps some part of me had calculated that this was a future possibility.
Even so, it was unbearably sad.
I still felt an uneasiness in my chest that I couldn't dispel.
Why did Shiona's tears shake me up so much?
And why was I so powerless?
I wasn't the real deal.
That much I knew.
Or, I thought I knew that.
Regardless, I still wanted people to smile.
Shiona, Tipi... Even the people in town. I wanted everyone to smile.
But I couldn't do it.
It was the truth, but I wished it wasn't.
I was an object that had been constructed.
And that was one truth that I couldn't go against.
But even faced with that truth, I hoped.
I hoped for the ability to make the people around me smile.
However, it was never meant to be.
When I tried to make Tipi smile, Shiona certainly didn't.
When I tried to make Shiona smile, Tipi wouldn't stop crying.
Why was this so difficult?
Was there a smoother way I could have used to make everyone happy?
As I watched Tipi sleeping soundly, something was eating away at my chest.
I stroked Tipi's head with my fingers.
I ran them through her silky hair, meeting no resistance.
I caught a sweet fragrance coming from her.
"Mnnm... Mnnmm..."
Tipi let out a soft noise. Perhaps she was dreaming.
Her sleeping face made me want to protect her more than ever.
But how could I?
I looked back and forth from my mechanical right hand to Tipi's face. I didn't know what to do.
I wondered if I could just stay in this soothing moment forever.
But I couldn't.
From far away, I heard a strange noise.
It sounded like footsteps, as though a hundred people were walking in unison.
Then, I began to hear faint screams and the sounds of objects breaking.
Those two things completely destroyed what small hopes I held.
I hurriedly put my glove back on.
"Wh... What's going on, Rei?"
Tipi woke up from all the commotion.
A look of uneasiness spread across her face.
"I don't know... But it seems like something has happened."
"What? What do you mean 'something'?"
"I have no idea. But it definitely doesn't seem like a good thing."
I stood up and made my way through the aisles of the library.
"Rei? Where are you going?"
"I'm just going to see what happened."
"No... Don't go, Rei."
"Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere. I'm just going to the roof to have a look."
"No... Don't..."
Tipi held on to me, crying.
I probably reminded her of her parents disappearing.
"It's alright. Everything's going to be okay, Tipi."
"Have I ever broken a promise to you?"
"That's right. When I said I'd come back to see you, I actually did, right?"
"Yeah. You keep your promises."
"So, like I said. Don't worry. I'm going to go up and see, and I'll come right back."
"Okay. But please hurry back."
"Of course."
After making that promise to Tipi, I made my way to the roof of the library.
After climbing the long spiral staircase, I finally arrived at a large, rusted door.
It seemed like it hadn't been used in a long time.
A terrible, grinding creak assaulted my ears as I opened the door.
I continued to push the door open.
When suddenly...
I realized the disaster in front of my eyes.
Plumes of black smoke rose from sources all over the village.
I hadn't misheard the scream-like sounds; they were coming from the townspeople as they fled something.
Chasing after the townsfolk were a number of dirty, cloaked figures.
They simply advanced silently at a walk, holding firearms. Yet their perfectly-coordinated movements were driving the fleeing townspeople into corners.
Their movement looked entirely calculated.
There was some sort of spoken exchange occurring between the assailants and the townsfolk, now trapped against a wall.
Signaling each other with nods, the assailants placed their weapons against the heads of the townsfolk.
Then, without any signs of hesitation, they pulled the triggers.
With a crack, the heads of the townsfolk jolted, and their bodies fell to the ground...
It was that sound that brought me back to reality and made me realize what had happened.
It was difficult to believe... but the town was apparently under attack.
Shiona had spoken the truth...
I rushed to make my way back to the lobby.
On seeing me, Tipi worriedly asked me some questions.
"Rei... Did something happen? You look really scared."
"I don't really understand what happened... But I feel like... it's something really bad..."
I fumbled for words, unable to tell Tipi exactly what I had seen.
"Something bad? What do you mean?"
"I think this town... is under attack."
"Oh no... I'm scared..."
"Don't worry. It's happening on the far side of town. We're still safe here, so please calm down."
"Okay... But what should we do?"
"I'm... I'm going to go and see what's happening for myself."
I was concerned for the town, but more so for Shiona's safety.
Regardless of what had happened yesterday, she was still the human who saved me.
I also did not know why Shiona was so harsh to Tipi alone, when she was incredibly kind to everyone else.
I still had no idea what she meant about it all being for me.
"No, don't go... Please... Rei..."
"Don't worry, Tipi. I promise I'll come back."
"Really? Do you really mean it?"
"Of course. So can you wait for me just a little while?"
"If you promise to come back, I'll wait."
Tipi squeezed her teddy bear tightly.
But her scared expression stayed the same.
Wasn't there anything I could do about this little girl's uncertainty and sadness?
Even though I still felt a darkness in my chest, I made my way out of the library.
I decided to take the back roads on my way to town.
What was happening in the town clearly wasn't good.
If I was found, I might well be harmed in some way.
I made for the plaza, keeping my footfalls as quiet as possible.
I wanted to arrive there before the group did, but I knew it was impossible using the winding route I took.
As I drew closer to the town's center, devastated buildings began to come into view.
But these buildings had all looked sturdy yesterday.
Had the strangers who were chasing the townspeople around done this?
The town had been beautiful yesterday; today, smoke poured from it.
Why did the buildings in this quiet town have to be destroyed?
Nothing about it made sense to me, no matter how hard I thought on it.
As the wailing and sound of buildings being destroyed grew louder, I finally arrived at the answer.
...It was a horrible scene at the plaza.
Many men were chasing and restraining the townspeople.
They had guns, and were using unnecessary force to corral men, women, and even children.
The captured townspeople were sitting in the central part of the plaza.
There were children wailing. There were wordless screams of rage.
The armed men were completely indifferent to the commotion, with calm looks on their faces.
Or perhaps it wasn't quite right to call them calm.
Their expressions were utterly uninterested, like that of someone glancing at a rock beside the road.
I couldn't see Shiona anywhere. Did that mean that she hadn't been caught yet?
"What's the situation?"
"The majority of the residents have been captured. Getting the rest is just a matter of time."
I heard two men talking nearby.
I moved closer, doing my best not to be noticed.
"What about the food and water?"
"They have plenty saved up. A groundwater source has also been found."
"I see. This is a greater harvest than we had imagined."
"Yes, sir. A settlement is possible, sir."
These men were the group of humans that had been attacking towns to seize food and water.
I realized I was clenching my fist.
I couldn't allow this injustice to unfold.
They were hurting innocent people, just to take things from them.
But there was nothing I could do.
I couldn't even jump out from where I was.
I knew better than anyone that I was completely powerless.
"But how was a town this small even discovered?"
"You remember that slave who ran off a few days back?"
"The one who was preaching about living together with Phiroids...?"
"Right, that fool with his head stuck in the past. The idea of coexisting peacefully with Phiroids in this world is utter nonsense."
Coexisting peacefully...
The words reminded me of that young man.
That young man's last words... the man I saved and brought back to this town.
Which meant that the wounds he suffered were inflicted by these humans.
"So we treated him just like a Phiroid, using him as a manual laborer."
"We chased after him simply to recapture him, and he ended up being useful in a surprising way."
One man continued on in an uninflected tone.
"Someone showed up to help him and led us to this town."
On hearing this, a shiver ran down my spine.
Why hadn't I thought of the reason for that young man's injuries at the time?
Shiona had warned me about the marauding groups, yet...
If I had paid more attention while I was returning to town, I might have been able to avoid being followed.
I regretted choosing the easy approach in a moment of shock.
The town had been attacked because of... me.
"All of the town leaders have been brought together. There was no resistance."
"I see. Now select the oral-nutrient consumer types that have no production or management skills from that group. All causes for productivity loss..."
As he said that, the man who had received the report reached into a pocket and pulled out a gun.
"...are to be disposed of."
As the meaning of his words dawned on me, I screamed.
Some part of me coldly pointed out that what I had done was intensely foolish.
But I couldn't restrain myself from screaming when faced with those who would casually "dispose of" the townspeople who had been so kind to me.
With that, the men turned toward me.
Our eyes met.
"Capture him."
As he spoke, the men rushed toward me.
Shaken, I started to run.
However, my body hadn't caught up with the situation.
My legs were unsteady and I fled with my balance askew, falling over myself.
They were right behind me almost immediately.
They moved with a mechanical sort of precision.
Things looked bad. They were going to catch me.
I took a chance and ran down an alley.
The alley was dotted with muddy pits due to the recent rain.
I continued to flee, the mud sucking at my feet as I went.
I tried to slow them by knocking over boards leaning against nearby walls when I could.
But it wasn't enough to stop them.
I knew they were right behind me.
I didn't know if I could lose them.
I was heading for the library.
Even if I managed to make it there, they would have found out about Tipi.
And if she was attacked...
I changed directions.
I ran into what looked to be the back door of the nearest building.
Coincidentally, it was also the door to Madd's shop.
I looked for a place to hide myself...
I stared at the person sitting in the chair.
"Madd, when did you ge... Wait, no! It's too dangerous here! You and I have to get... Madd?"
Madd didn't answer. He sat with his arms folded, just as he had after we finished using the projector that day.
"Madd, can you hear me!?This isn't the time for jokes, Madd... Madd?"
I swallowed my screams at the last second.
I touched Madd's shoulder, and he... quietly fell from his chair. It was as if he was already dead.
Perhaps those men had "disposed of" him. But there were no signs of injury on him.
If that was the case, then what exactly happened? Who did this? And why!?
"Target acquired."
In a dark twist, the voices of my pursuers brought me back to reality as I was beginning to panic.
However, it was too late.
"We have enough laborers. Eliminate him."
I couldn't cope with what was happening. I leaped away from Madd. One of the soldiers barged in, trained his gun on me, and...
The next instant, many things happened at once.
The front door was kicked open.
A gunshot rang out sharply.
Someone slid in front of me, to protect me.
It took me some time to understand what had happened.
In line with the barrel of the gun.
A figure interposed itself, protecting me.
The figure's face turned back to look at me.
The figure looked at me with the same, unchanging smile as always.
After a few seconds...
My face white as a ghost, I screamed.
Still smiling, her hair swayed as she fell to her knees then collapsed onto the floor.
After watching what happened, my body began moving on its own.
Using my mechanical arm, I punched the shelf and sent it crashing down. It had a domino effect and caused other shelves to fall down. Fragments of broken products and dust surrounded me.
At the same time, I grabbed a can off the floor and threw it at the window as hard as I could.
The men reacted to the sound of broken glass.
"He escaped through the window."
"After him."
The men dashed outside through the still-open doorway.
"Are they finally gone?"
As for me, I was next to the downed shelves. I was hunched over, motionless, my body halfway embedded in the damaged floor.
I was covering Shiona to make sure she didn't get hit by the shelves and debris.
"Shiona, Shiona! Hang in there!"
Shiona's eyes were still closed, and I began shaking her violently.
She seemed to have lost consciousness.
I looked her over, but I couldn't find any wounds.
Had the bullet missed her? But she had lost consciousness, so she couldn't be alright.
Regardless, I had to find shelter for a while.
The only place close by was...
I took a deep breath, and remembered.
The young girl waiting at the library came into focus.
I took the back roads to the library in order to avoid discovery by the humans.
Having Shiona on my back was a significant handicap, but I avoided my enemies by cutting through one gutted building after another.
Shiona didn't move at all over the journey. That made her easier to carry, but it also made me more worried for her.
If anything had happened to Shiona... Even as my terror at the thought nearly overwhelmed me, I arrived at the library.
The clouds that had stolen the sky were growing even darker.
After finally arriving at the library, I began my search for Tipi.
Was Tipi alright?
From what I could see, the library hadn't been attacked so far.
There were no traces of anyone entering, either.
Once past the entrance, the interior of the library silent.
Feeling a sense of relief, I weaved in and out of the aisles to search for Tipi.
However, I couldn't find her no matter how much I searched.
I began searching for her again to drive off the unpleasant thoughts.
She wasn't at her usual place, and she wasn't organizing the bookshelves.
Holding onto my hopes, I ventured toward the lobby.
I arrived at the lobby counter.
I looked behind it.
There, I found Tipi quivering and covering her eyes and ears.
I extended a hand to the tiny girl.
"Tipi, I'm back."
Her shoulders jumped a little.
But after realizing I was back, she jumped up and hugged me.
"Welcome back. I always believed in you, Rei."
She pushed her tear-streaked face against my chest.
She was shivering terribly.
Once again, I had left her alone with her fears.
I began to pat her back.
"Don't worry... I won't leave you again."
I didn't know if it was because of what I said, but Tipi's quivering slowed and eventually stopped.
"What happened? What's wrong with Shiona?"
She looked at Shiona, whose eyes were still closed, and then began asking questions cautiously.
I told her flatly without hiding anything.
"She was shot. All because she protected me... I couldn't find any wounds, but she lost consciousness..."
"Show her to me now!"
With sharp movements that I hadn't seen from her previously, Tipi laid Shiona on the floor.
"Rei, turn around. I'm going to search Shiona for any wounds."
"Ah... Right... So... Is she hurt!?"
"I don't know. But I'm going to check."
I saw Tipi start to unfasten Shiona's clothing, then quickly turned away.
Soon after...
"Everything's okay. There were... no problems, Rei."
Tipi had returned to her normal way of speaking.
I turned around silently.
Shiona was lying the floor of the lobby, breathing softly.
I thought she had been hit when she covered me, but it seemed as if the sound of the point-blank gunshot had knocked her unconscious.
"Thank goodness..."
I breathed an enormous sigh of relief.
"Rei, why was Shiona shot?"
"The humans came. And they began raiding the town. They destroyed buildings, and..."
I didn't tell her about how they were "disposing of" people, or about how Madd might have already been "dealt with."
"When they found me and were about to shoot me, Shiona jumped in front of me and..."
Without thinking, I had my fist clenched. Tipi gazed at me with sympathy in her eyes.
"I see... Well if that's true... Then we might not be safe here, either."
She said with a gentle smile.
"Maybe we can hide and wait it out... We could make do until the humans left, somehow..."
Tipi shook her head sadly to cut me off.
"The humans found the town. A town they can live in. Which means they'll come here, too."
"No way... They're here to stay...?"
"Yeah, this is a 'town', after all."
Ah, right. A town.
I had walked through the barren wastes before I got to this town.
There was no water or food. I thought I was going to die the entire time.
Those humans must have also had to survive in such a world.
If they had, then this "town" was a paradise beyond their wildest dreams.
"But... Even so, why do they have to steal it? The people living here would have taken them in."
"It's all so that they can survive."
"So... they think they can do anything, even sacrifice the lives of other people for their own sake...? That's wrong!"
"Rei, you're scaring me..."
"Ah, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you..."
I unclenched the fist I had balled up in anger, and began to pat Tipi to calm her down.
I had to focus on Shiona and Tipi.
If we stayed in the town, they were both in danger.
In all honesty, I wanted to help everyone in the town. But I couldn't do that right then. I wasn't strong or smart enough.
I subdued the emotions Shiona and the townspeople had taught me, and attempted to think more mechanically... More efficiently...
First, we needed to get to a place where we could calm down.
"Tipi, let's leave the town. Then we can think of a way to save the townspeople."
I felt my chest constrict as I spoke.
I had just assigned priorities to lives.
I chose the lives in front of me. The ones within my reach.
It was certainly disgraceful. All life is equally precious... But even so, I found myself choosing.
"Sounds like a good idea."
This agreement from a little girl lessened the guilt weighing me down.
"Let's hide in the abandoned factory for a bit. There's nothing that humans want over there."
"Alright, but we have to prepare food for you and Shiona..."
"Yeah, good point. If we can make it to the church, then that would be great."
The library we were in and the church were at opposite ends of the town, with the plaza in the center.
If we were to leave the town and make a detour, we could have been caught with no cover. That would have led to all of us getting picked off at range. To make matters worse, I had to carry Shiona on my back.
Which meant I would probably have to crawl through debris in order to advance, again. Also, Tipi was with me this time, making things even more difficult.
I explained to her as best as I could.
"Is it hard to get to the church?"
"Yeah... Well, right now it is."
"So we should go under, then."
"Yes, under. We'll get there by going under the ground."
"Under the ground... Do you mean like tunnels?"
"Yes, tunnels. Nobody will be able to find us there."
"Tunnels... But how?"
"Well, you open the manhole, and then you can walk around under the town."
I never knew.
But it made sense. Underground, nobody could find us and we could make it to the church safely.
"That's a good idea, Tipi! You're really smart."
"Hehe... Thank you."
"But where are the manholes located?"
"Hm... Follow me."
Tipi led me to a bookshelf by the hand.
Without the slightest bit of hesitation, she took me straight to a bookshelf.
"That's the one."
I picked up the book she indicated, and opened it up.
Inside were detailed maps of the locations of manholes and tunnels under the town.
"This is amazing, Tipi! With this, we should be able to get to the church with no problem at all!"
I patted Tipi on the head, and her eyes started to shine with happiness.
But her expression of joy was still mixed with sadness.
"Alright, Tipi. Let's move out!"
"Okay... But hold on a moment. I need to prepare... Can I have a second?"
"Sure, no problem."
She made a slight bow, and disappeared into the back room.
I paused a moment to observe Shiona lying on the floor.
Tipi had said there wasn't a problem, but I was concerned that she hadn't regained consciousness.
Maybe they didn't shoot her with bullets, but rather with a weapon that takes away your freedom to move.
If I knew the cause, I could find a solution.
I never realized the unknown could be so terrifying.
"Thanks for waiting, Rei. ...What's wrong?"
Tipi came out of the back room.
"It's nothing. I was just worried about Shiona, that's all."
I answered, trying to appear as calm as I could.
"Alright, what are you bringing?"
Tipi had said she needed to prepare, and was holding a large bag.
"My teddy bear... Coloring books... Crayons."
"Alright then. Those are important, yeah."
"Also... A photo of my mom and dad."
She said sadly.
A photo of the parents she would likely never see again.
I couldn't make out how she was feeling when she looked at that photo.
"Ah, but what about this?"
Other than the big bag, Tipi was also holding a thin yet solid case made out of metal. It looked a bit big for a girl Tipi's size to carry.
"Oh this? I'll explain later. But come on. Let's go."
"Oh... Alright..."
Tipi helped me pick Shiona up from the floor. Strangely, I couldn't feel her weight.
"Alright, Tipi. I'm ready when you are."
"Yeah... Bye-bye home..."
Tipi said her farewells as we approached the innumerable bookshelves.
There was a hit of sadness in her voice.
I still hadn't been able to help her with that at all.
But I hadn't given up.
We were going to be together forever, from that point on.
Even if it was slow progress as we spent time together,
I wanted to relieve Tipi from her misery.
Someday, I hoped I could see a real heartfelt smile from her.
In secret, that was what I hoped for.
The three of us set off, leaving the library behind.
Making our way while always paying attention to our surroundings took more time than I thought it would.
Even so, Tipi came along without letting out a peep.
When we made it to the church, we were both awfully exhausted.
There were no signs of humans in the area.
We stepped inside the church, looking around the vicinity cautiously.
The chapel was as still as death.
It was a silence that made the turmoil in the town seem like an utter lie.
I spotted the music box on the altar inside the chapel.
Had Shiona been listening to it here?
My footsteps as I headed to the music box resounded through the chapel.
Drawing close to the altar, I reached for the music box.
When I turned the handle, a melody flowed out from inside.
That melody warmed me somewhere inside my chest.
Suddenly, I heard a singing voice.
It came from behind me.
Shiona spoke, climbing down from my back.
"Sorry, I guess I passed out."
"Don't worry about that. Are you hurt? Tipi said you're fine, but..."
"No, I seem to be fine."
Shiona smiled to calm me. Then she saw Tipi beside me.
"Tipi... You came too."
Tipi nodded, with a face that was as sad as always, yet seemingly prepared for something.
"But Tipi, for you the library is..."
Tipi held out the palm of her hand toward Shiona, stopping her from speaking.
"That was the only choice. You saw the town, so you must understand, right?"
"I understand, I do... but...!"
Shiona hung her head as if she was trying to resist something.
In response, Tipi was nothing but kind.
"Thank you for everything."
I had not expected to hear that. Shiona took a breath and looked into Tipi's tiny eyes.
"I realized it while I was with Rei. What it was you were trying to do."
"But, then..."
"Because of that, I came here. The library is beyond hope now. And likely, the town is too."
"Tipi, I'm sorry..."
"It's alright. You don't have to cry."
Shiona knelt and dove toward Tipi, pressing herself to the girl's chest. Tipi held her gently as she spoke.
It was a sight that could have tricked you into believing that Tipi was the elder of the two.
"Rei, what do we do now?"
I hurriedly came back to my senses when she asked me.
"If Shiona seems alright, then I want to help the townspeople. Especially the people they said would be disposed of."
"Disposed of?"
It was a heartless way to put it. A way of reducing humans to objects, instead of treating them as people.
Arrogant and tyrannical... Those guys were just like robots, without an ounce of warmth in their hearts.
"Can you do it, Rei?"
"I don't know. But I can't just sit by and watch people about to be killed."
"But Rei, it's dangerous."
"Yeah, I know, but..."
My opponents were people who could turn a gun on anyone without batting an eye. There wasn't anything I could do by facing them head-on.
And there definitely was no way to discuss anything with them.
"I'll make a promise. I'll definitely come back if it gets even a little dangerous."
"You must. Because if you get hurt... nothing can undo that."
"Yeah. And I don't intend to leave you behind either."
Silently, we stared at one and another.
"Don't forget about me..."
With that, we separated like two magnets repelling each other.
"S-Sorry! It's not that we forgot you!"
"Shiona gets all the attention..."
Tipi spoke, the corners of her lips pulling into a slight frown.
"Sorry, Tipi. I didn't mean..."
I softly stroked her head as I apologized.
"Hmph. That's not what I meant, but..."
Even as she spoke, Tipi's expression didn't seem nearly as upset as she was letting on.
The first to grin at the situation was Shiona. Then Tipi and I smiled too.
We all laughed together.
All three of us held hands.
We grasped each others' hands tightly, as if we'd never let go again.
While that determination was still strong, I made a declaration.
"We three will always be together. Forever."
But then, as if to mock me...
Footsteps echoed in the distance.
Shiona and Tipi's smiles both stiffened.
Mine certainly must have, as well.
All the townspeople were being held.
So the ones headed for this church...
They had to be humans.
I was the first of us able to move. I looked out from the window, careful not to make a sound.
There was a single figure visible. But I couldn't tell how many would come after him.
"Shiona, Tipi, get inside the chapel. Try to crouch down as much as you can so you can't be seen from outside."
"Okay, but shouldn't I lock the door first?"
"No. If you do that, he'll definitely call for help. Then we won't stand a chance."
I wanted to disable the human outside, without making any noise if I could help it.
If I only had one opponent, I thought I could manage somehow. And if there were two, maybe I could spring a surprise attack.
But if there were three or more... I didn't tell Shiona or Tipi, but I planned on being the only one caught in that case.
I walked quietly to stand in the shadow of the door. Meanwhile, the footsteps grew closer.
There was only one pair. No one seemed to be coming after them.
I quietly sucked in a deep breath, preparing myself for the worst.
I even prepared myself for Shiona and Tipi to find out the truth.
My breath froze. The footsteps... were right beside me.
The door opened slowly.
Then a man holding a pistol entered, also slowly.
Instantly, I swung my arm down on him at full force from a blind spot.
My aim was true, and it knocked the gun from his hands.
Without a moment's delay, I kicked the fallen gun and sent it flying.
I aimed to trip him at the same time, but as expected he was able to avoid it.
We were still so close as to be glued to each other.
It was probably best to assume he had weapons other than the gun.
If he did and I sprung on him the moment he reached for one, I would catch him off guard.
But the man just silently tilted his head and looked at me.
"What do you think you're doing?"
He asked in a monotone.
"Why are you hostile to us? Are you the owner of this town?"
"Owner? I just want to do whatever I can to help the people of this town."
"You almost sound like a Phiroid."
"So what? That's my reason for being."
With those words, I removed the glove from my right hand, showing my mechanical hand.
It wasn't a good idea to go toe-to-toe with me and my mechanical body.
If I could get him to believe that, maybe he'd back down.
All I wanted then was to ensure Shiona and Tipi's safety. Even if my true form was exposed to them, I would protect what I wanted to protect.
That was my duty as a Phiroid.
The man tilted his head once again in response to my action.
"What are you saying? Phiroids can't take any sort of combative action. They're made to be unable to defy humans, and to follow orders."
