"It doesn't matter. You are a nonconformist, poisoned by thoughts of the old ways. I will eliminate you before your evil spreads."
The man produced a knife without showing any signs of being shaken, and sprung at me.
The tip of the knife sped toward me, aimed directly at my throat.
I grabbed the blade with my mechanical hand. Then, putting all of my strength into the motion, I twisted it.
And just like that, the blade of the knife broke at the base with a snap.
I used the weight of my whole body to push him down. I held my left elbow to his throat and held down both of his legs with my knees.
Shiona jumped out from inside the room.
"Don't look!"
I held down his throat again with my left hand, speaking as I raised the exposed metal of my right hand.
My metal arm that could break even a knife... If I swung it down on his head at full force that would be the end.
"Rei, stop."
With a trembling voice, she pleaded.
Gnashing my teeth, I mustered all of my strength... and brought down my right hand.
A dull sound echoed around me.
My right hand was halfway embedded.
Not into the man's head, but into the floor immediately beside it.
"Why let me live? If you're thinking about your safety, killing me is the correct choice."
He spoke, still utterly expressionless.
"I don't think so. Killing is the wrong choice no matter the reason."
"You're beyond all help. Such inefficient thinking."
"I'll make you our hostage. Then I can make them free the townspeople."
I grabbed the nape of his neck, pulling him up.
"That would be pointless. My life isn't worth that much. If my death grants my comrades a future, then there is no reason to begrudge it."
Without changing the tone of his voice in the least, the man produced something from his pocket.
It was an old style of bomb. He seized my arm as he pulled the pin.
I drew back my arm immediately, but he was unyielding.
"You will die with me."
I was horrified.
How could this human not show any emotions in his expression even as he attempted to end his own life?
His eyes were vacant of all signs of awareness, and it felt as though they had paralyzed me.
I had to get it to together! If he made me stop thinking, it was all over!
My thoughts changed gears instantly, and I started to analyze the situation.
What the man held was a very small bomb, the size of a small fruit.
But as a bomb, it was probably lethal, and above all the sound of the explosion was likely to be noticed by the humans occupying the town.
When would it go off, when?
The man must have intended to kill himself as well. I certainly didn't have much time.
But what could I do? If the explosion was large, it could hurt Shiona and Tipi where they were hiding.
If it was impossible to disable the bomb, then how could I keep its effect to a minimum?
I reflexively clung to the man, in a way that put the bomb between us.
This way, at least I might be able to protect Shiona and Tipi. Maybe it wasn't a perfect plan, but it was the option I thought was best.
If I could at least protect those two...
The very next instant came an impact.
It came from beside me. It was enough to knock me away... no, it did knock me away!
As I rolled on the floor, I looked at the place where I had just been.
There was Shiona, holding the bomb.
"Get down!"
At the same time that we both cried out, the scene before me was subsumed in a burst of light.
The bomb she was holding exploded in a powerful blast of light and noise.
Perhaps it was because the bomb wasn't intended for killing, but the explosion wasn't that big.
Even still, I was hit by the blast and the sound at point-blank range, and my head spun.
The human who had also been in range had lost consciousness.
My vision roiling and swaying, I screamed.
I couldn't focus because I had looked directly at the explosion.
I wanted her to be okay somehow. Somehow.
At the same time came a small voice.
Undoubtedly Shiona's.
"Shio... na..."
"Shiona, we need to get you treatment right away!"
The distance of a few steps felt so very long.
Staggering on uncertain legs, I stepped up to Shiona.
And that's where I saw it.
"What... is this...?"
I was at a loss for words when I saw Shiona.
Her severed arm was lying on the ground... and from the wrist up was... a metal... frame?
They weren't bones. Absolutely not. It was clearly different from a human skeleton.
And... Something was missing.
Something that should have been there, wasn't.
Even though it was strange, even impossible for it not to be there.
The proof of one's humanity.
"Wh... Wh... Why?"
"Please don't stare so much. It's embarrassing..."
I clenched my gloved, mechanical right hand.
Shiona had always been... the same as me...?
But if we were the same... I wanted us to be the same, but...
"Shiona, that's.... are you... okay?"
"Yeah, if that's all the damage."
That couldn't be.
There was no way.
She had been so close to the explosion.
There was no way she should be okay.
Surely she should be in agony, hurting so much she couldn't keep from crying.
And yet.
"Enough about me... Rei, your head."
Shiona's eyes opened wide, staring at my head.
Following her gaze, I brought my hand to my head.
How could this be?
Why did I have what Shiona needed?
I didn't need this.
I had no use for this; I wanted Shiona to have it.
Rather, she should have it.
Shiona touched her hand to my head as she spoke.
"You're bleeding! Are you alright?"
Blood was streaming from my head.
Red blood.
Blood only flowed in humans.
Not in Phiroids...
In contrast, there wasn't a single drop of blood from Shiona's arm.
Instead, I could see exposed mechanical parts.
This could only mean one thing.
It meant...
"Rei? There was a loud noise. Are you alright... Shiona?! Rei?!"
Tipi, who had come out from inside, let out a scream.
With an uneasy expression, her eyes welled up full of tears.
"We need to fix both of your injuries...!"
"It's alright... I'm alright..."
I held the panicked Tipi in my arms, softly wrapping her up.
An ever so slightly relieved look spread across her face in the center of my chest.
But that wasn't a stable thing.
Seeing her expression ready to crumble at any moment, the inside of my chest ached.
"Rei... we need to move, we can't stay here anymore..."
Tipi spoke in a trembling voice. Shiona nodded.
There was no doubt that other humans would come because of the sound of the blast.
There was a lot I wanted to ask.
There was a lot I wanted to make sure of, too.
But I swallowed those questions.
"Let's go, and leave the town."
Carrying as little baggage as we could, we left the church.
Then we used the back streets of the town, following Tipi's instructions, and set our sights on the abandoned factory when we escaped to the outside.
Even then I realized...
The only one whose pace slowed from exhaustion was me.
Led by Tipi, I kept walking with Shiona leading me by the hand.
When we arrived at the abandoned factory, I finally sat down on the ground.
I steadied my rough breathing beside Shiona, who was nonchalant.
"I'll go get some water."
The small girl disappeared inside the abandoned factory after giving Shiona a glance.
She was probably entrusting Shiona with explaining everything.
She responded to my voice with a slightly concerned smile.
Then, as she touched her own right arm... her exposed mechanical arm, she opened her mouth.
"You've probably already noticed, but I'm... well... Everyone who lives in this town is a Phiroid."
This was... something I had been trying to avoid seeing the entire time.
I had a hunch... strange feelings... but I had not wanted to admit it.
"And... I'm 'human'?"
When my head had gotten injured, a red fluid had leaked out of the injured spot.
It resembled the "blood" that ran through human bodies.
Phiroids were not equipped with this liquid, so it shouldn't have been there to be released.
"You had always misunderstood, because you have a mechanical arm... But that's a prosthetic for medical use, to compensate for limbs lost in accidents."
"That can't... then I'm actually..."
"That's right, you're human. A parent and partner to us Phiroids. That's you. All of the townspeople are Phiroids. You were the only human."
"I see..."
I looked at my gloved mechanical hand and clenched it weakly.
Everything was the opposite of what I had believed until now...
Shiona was a Phiroid... I was a human...
In short, I was a human, a being that I ought to hate.
I felt something inside my chest.
It was an agonizing feeling.
It was a feeling with no definite name.
I was the same as those humans.
The same as those beings I could only think of as cold-hearted, ruthless, and evil.
There was nothing I could do as my chest grew tight.
I felt angry at a fact I couldn't change.
What the man I had been fighting with had said was right.
I was a human, not a Phiroid.
And the human rulers were trying to do horrible things to the Phiroid townspeople they ruled... No, they were probably already doing horrible things.
Why did it have to be this way?
I had just wanted to live with Shiona and the townspeople.
I had just wanted to make everyone happy.
I couldn't do that.
I wasn't qualified to do that.
Because I was a human.
Because I was just another one of those ridiculous animals.
I felt a warmth in the fist I had balled up unconsciously.
When I lowered my gaze, Shiona's hand was resting on top of mine.
Her warmth was artificial,
but that didn't matter to me.
It was warm.
That was enough to lighten the emotions that burdened my heart.
But at the same time, it made my own inefficiency clear.
Was I even worthy of receiving her kindness?
"Do you want to know more? About you guys."
Shiona spoke to me with a smile.
"By 'you guys', do you mean humans?"
"Yes, humans. Do you want to know about our partners?"
If I could understand more, I wanted to.
So I nodded.
"I do. I want to know why we ended up like this."
"Do you remember Tipi's drawings in the library?"
"Yeah, I do."
"Tipi draws those pictures every day. Every single day, one picture a day, no matter what."
I closed my eyes, recalling the scene.
There were dozens, even hundreds of pictures drawn in crayon.
"How many do you think there are?"
"I don't know... Since Tipi's a Phiroid too, she must have been drawing them for years. There might be about a thousand."
"Eighty six thousand, six hundred seventy one."
Again, I was hit with a powerful dizziness. But it wasn't because of the explosion, nor the bleeding.
"That's two hundred and thirty seven years, five months and sixteen days' worth of drawings."
Had Tipi spent such a long time alone in that dark library?
There couldn't have been many people who went to that library.
That must have been a very lonely daily routine for her.
When I thought of the time Tipi had spent there, I felt scared, like that was enough to make the earth beneath my feet melt away.
Tipi had endured that.
With that small body of hers.
"A few decades before that, we Phiroids were born. The humans wanted us..."
Shiona recounted the history of the Phiroids as if she was reciting a song.
At first, Phiroids were androids advanced enough for practical use, with human emotions installed.
Basic emotional information was installed from the initial stage. Later, independent thought circuits were adopted for a system allowing new emotions to be learned.
With that in place, they were virtually indistinguishable from humans.
This allowed them to grow very close to the humans; not just in work, but in daily life as well.
Before long, businesses cropped up to install custom-made emotions and memories, and there was an unprecedented boom in Phiroid popularity.
It was the dawn of an age in which families unable to have children purchased Phiroid children, and people who lost love ones ordered Phiroids with their memories.
Almost overnight, the number of Phiroids multiplied, and they were produced in numbers that rivaled the human population after just ten-odd years.
What was most innovative of all was the existence of Phiroids equipped with "love," the most complex human emotion.
They had the ability to fill roles as lifelong partners.
It was possible to find someone to be loved by without undergoing the process of building affection, and that love was guaranteed semi-permanently.
The average age of marriage was increasing, and there were an increasing number of humans who prioritized work over love. Phiroids were received to great acclaim in such a society, and demand was high.
However, families resulting from marriages with Phiroids were unable to have children, exacerbating the low birth rate.
The lack of children being born produced a lack of marriage partners, and created a loop where marriages to Phiroids increased further still.
"And then, before we knew it, the humans had forgotten how to foster love."
Shiona smiled sadly.
"Human children ended up being born artificially, using science. But the humans who had lost love were unable to teach those children about love."
Love was the origin of all emotions.
Because of love, we feel happy when we interact with others.
Because of love, we know what we want to protect and feel anger when it is hurt.
Because of love, we feel sadness when we lose something important.
Because of love... we can feel the same emotions, share them, and know enjoyment.
However... That had been forgotten.
The humans who had come to the town must have been this type of "human."
The humans who had forgotten "emotion" along with love had even lost their capacity to empathize with others.
Humans no longer needed love, and found the existence of the emotional Phiroids distasteful.
When they thought over the efficiency of their actions, they found it all too wasteful.
Before long, humans looked upon Phiroids as mere machines.
Taking them to harsh environments... putting them to dangerous work... working them past their limits...
But there were humans who didn't approve of that.
The humans who still had the emotion of love protested. They said the Phiroids were our partners.
The world was divided in two.
Into humans with love, and humans without love.
Those without came to a conclusion.
The prior era's thinking was foolish, and needed to be exterminated.
They didn't even feel hesitation when they pressed the buttons on the weapons that razed the earth.
The rest came quickly.
Revenge demanded revenge, and it didn't even take five days to blanket the world in fire and ashes.
The polluted, poisoned earth, the black clouds blocking the sunlight, the ocean that couldn't support life...
They ushered in the end of human history with their own hands...
It was such a foolish choice.
"We Phiroids, born for the humans, took away something that was very important to humans."
"Not at all... We humans were entirely at fault."
"But there were many humans that survived. No matter how much the world falls apart, life keeps moving forward."
I couldn't find the words to respond to Shiona, who spoke to me in a gentle voice.
"Ahem. Ah, ah, ah."
Suddenly, Shiona started a vocal training exercise.
I was puzzled as she faced me head on and...
"Nice to meet you. I'm an Aso International MODA-117 Alice mk-17. Have you already registered as user? If you are already registered, please choose my unit name. This will be the first name given to me. Please choose carefully!"
...I hadn't expected that.
It was surprising enough as something I hadn't seen before, but I was truly shocked because it was the first time I'd seen such a boundlessly bright, innocent Shiona.
"Did I surprise you?"
Shiona asked, back to her usual self.
"That just now was the oldest memory I have."
"Your oldest memory?"
From just how long ago? I couldn't imagine at all.
"At the time, it was like every day was a festival... It was very lively."
She said, showing me a scrap of paper that seemed to be a newspaper clipping.
"World Famous Musician Passes Away"
The picture shown was the same as the one in the frame in Shiona's room.
The owner of the face that resembled mine.
"This is... your brother?"
"Yes. It's a story from a long while ago. You see, I was the newest model of the Phiroids that were being produced. Maybe the fifth generation."
How did Shiona feel about saying she was "produced?"
Phiroids had the same emotions as humans.
In other words, they were the same as humans.
Could they really be that easily separated?
"My generation was the first model equipped with the concept of 'death', in order to be indistinguishable from humans. But the models before me are not equipped with it... like Madd and Tipi. Neither of them can understand 'death'. Explaining is futile. There will never be a day when they can understand it."
They were waiting forever, unaware of death.
There was hope in that, but it was a hope that would never be rewarded.
A despair called hope.
It was thrust on them, unconditionally.
Faced by something like that, surely it would be kinder to be taught despair from the start.
It seemed to me that despair would be less cruel.
"Tipi is an older model. I'm pretty sure that she's a second generation Phiroid. We couldn't get energy from food until after the second generation. So they operate on batteries. But there's a limit on how long batteries can power a Phiroid. She carries that stuffed bear as an auxiliary battery."
Looking back on it, Tipi always had that stuffed bear in hand when she was going somewhere.
I hadn't noticed at all that it was a battery.
But there was something I understood because of that.
Why Tipi was always in the library.
The only power system in the town was in the library.
Tipi had to stay there in order to continue working.
"Tipi's parents died quite a while ago as well. Probably more than 200 years ago. But Tipi waits for them, with no concept of death. Forever and ever, alone."
What a cruel story.
I didn't know the lifespan of a Phiroid, but Tipi had lived like that for centuries.
Every single day, while tears ran down her face.
For a future that wouldn't come... A slave to a hope that would never come true.
All by herself in the library.
It felt like there was lead inside my chest.
It was agonizingly painful.
But the more I thought of it, the deeper it sunk into me.
"But knowing is painful, too."
And then there was Shiona, aware of death. In short, she couldn't even hold the hope that maybe she could see him once again.
"Rei, you saw Madd collapse at the general store."
"Yeah. It was odd. He didn't have any external wounds at all; it was like his soul had just left him..."
Then I understood. Madd was already broken then.
"But we have to live like this. Until the day of what we consider death... The day we break. For us Phiroids who don't even get ill, it's almost an eternity. So we try to be human. Wouldn't it just be too sad if we didn't? We take over the jobs our partners did, step in to do the jobs of those who are gone... We keep the world running, like the humans did. So that the world the humans ran never stops."
Madd ran the general store.
There were many shops throughout the town: photo studios, bars.
Those too were all the work of Phiroids.
The Phiroids labored, trying to protect the world of the humans.
The last hope of the remaining Phiroids.
"We spend every day so that when the humans come back one day, we can tell them of those fun times and restore them."
Shiona smiled.
It was a sentiment that didn't suit our current situation in the least.
Shiona was protecting herself with that smile.
It seemed sad to me.
"But we Phiroids have faults too. Like when something unbearably painful happens, and only a specific kind of emotion comes to the forefront. I'm like this, Madd is always angry, and Tipi is always sad."
She continued.
"But that's our last stand. If even that emotion was to vanish, we'd break... We'd die."
"So when you got shot, Madd..."
"Right. He didn't go on a trip. When you finished showing him that movie, he bro... No, he was unable to function."
"So the one who closed the shop... That was you?"
"Yeah. Since the townspeople thought you might suspect something, otherwise. In reality you did, didn't you?"
"Well, yeah, but..."
If the shop there had stayed open, I definitely would've gone in and found Madd motionless.
If the humans hadn't come, I'm sure I would never have noticed.
In the end, I definitely hadn't just seen things wrong.
I hadn't wanted to believe it, but it was the truth.
"My brother once said something to me, 'Emotions are a piece of the puzzle of life'. The piece known as emotion connects lives. If we're missing emotions, the entire structure falls apart. It's true of both humans and Phiroids. Madd broke because his anger towards his son vanished."
If that was true, then I was the one who killed Madd.
I'd self-indulgently gone and found playback equipment, and self-indulgently showed Madd his son's film.
If I had just not done that, Madd wouldn't have broken and he'd still be operating.
Perhaps sensing my feelings, Shiona moved to my left side and placed a hand on mine.
"It's okay, it's not your fault. We're destined to end up like that sooner or later. It's the same as how humans can't escape death. I'm sure Madd was happy. In the end he was able to know his son's true feelings."
"Maybe. But..."
My miserable thoughts worsened.
If I had known at the time... I would have stopped it, even by force.
"You're kind, Rei."
"It's not like that..."
She stood beside me.
I couldn't see Shiona's expression.
Anxiety pounded my chest from the inside.
"But I hoped, even though I knew. I hoped that someday I'd be able to see that smile again."
Shiona smiled sadly as she dropped her gaze to the photo of her brother.
"So when I first met you, I was incredibly happy. I thought it must be a dream. I thought my brother was alive."
It was painful whether you knew of it or not.
To Phiroids, unable to die, there was a sadness greater than that of humans in death.
They were made to be useful to humans, forced into families, and then left behind with only the pain of death.
Selfish, the lowest of the low.
That's what we humans were.
"Tipi feels the loneliness of having lost her family. So if you behave like family would, she'll 'die'. Even so, it wasn't that I didn't want anyone to tell you. It's that we Phiroids have a rule that we mustn't take actions that would reveal that we are Phiroids, because that would crush the humans' dreams. But I overdid it. I'm sorry."
Shiona lowered her head, and a sweet smell wafted lightly through the air.
Obviously, what Shiona had done seemed unacceptable.
But when I considered it with her feelings in mind, it was clear the measures she'd taken were the most appropriate.
"There was nothing else you could do. You were just following the rules. You didn't do anything wrong."
Forgiving someone and being forgiven.
Apologizing and being apologized to.
Crying, being angry, laughing.
That was human.
She and the other Phiroids knew that better than anyone.
"Thanks for talking with me, Shiona. And being so kind to me, a human..."
I felt guilty as a human.
Treating these ever-so-devoted Phiroids in such a way, as if we were punishing their good deeds.
Even as we were speaking, the humans might have been "disposing" of the Phiroids in town.
And the Phiroids likely couldn't do anything to resist them.
When I thought about that, I couldn't hide the pain inside my chest.
Shiona kindly extended her arms and embraced me.
I was enfolded in warmth.
"It's natural. Humans and Phiroids always were and are still partners. That's how it'll be forever more."
I felt as if that was the key to the emotion I hadn't understood to the end.
It was warm, vast, deep, strong, gentle, soft, big, and precious.
The humans had lost something critical.
But the Phiroids remembered what we'd forgotten, for us.
For years, decades, centuries...
Braving through isolation, they continued to protect us.
I felt like I had to carry on that legacy, and protect them in the same way.
It wasn't an obligation or a directive.
It was what I wanted.
"I'm back! There was clean water."
As I was sharing body heat with Shiona, Tipi called out to us from behind.
Somehow embarrassed, I promptly distanced myself from Shiona.
The air stole away the warmth that touched my skin,
but immediately a new warmth filled that gap.
When I looked, Tipi had stepped in between Shiona and me.
"I want a hug too."
Shiona and I exchanged glances.
Shiona seemed to be leaving the decision to me.
Tipi had lived in isolation for over two hundred years.
If things stayed like this, she could continue to live for nearly an eternity, never breaking.
But was that happiness?
Was there value in an empty life?
I embraced Shiona.
Along with Tipi, as she stood between us.
Shiona held me back in the same way.
Tipi held us both, whispering softly.
"It's warm..."
A warmth she'd not felt for two hundred years.
She had waited more than two hundred years for such a trivial thing.
What a sad time...
If I could have given her two hundred years of warmth, I definitely would have.
I felt like if I did, then I could say the time she had waited hadn't been wasted.
"What next, Rei?"
Shiona asked me, still holding Tipi from behind.
"If I can... I want to help all the townspeople, but... I think right now that's impossible."
It was an inexcusable thing to do to the townspeople, but I didn't have the strength to do otherwise.
First, I wanted to ensure Shiona and Tipi's safety.
"It's a bit far, but let's go to the factory I woke up in."
No, that couldn't have been a factory.
It was a facility to sleep in until the polluted lands of the war-torn, uninhabitable earth improved even a little.
I... had been a bit late waking up.
"There was still electricity there. Shiona and I can get nutrients from oral intake so we'll manage if we have the food we brought from town. But Tipi needs to be charged."
What I had just said must have been enough for her to figure things out. She raised her voice.
"Does Rei know about the Phiroids?"
"Yes, he does. I'm sorry."
"It's okay. I was thinking we'd have to tell him soon."
She continued with a somewhat sorrowful, slightly stiff expression.
"I need to do what I can... Right away."
Shiona questioned her, perhaps caught up on something about what she'd said.
But it must not have been something Tipi was especially concerned about. She didn't say anything further.
"We'll survive together."
I was speaking aimlessly.
There were no guarantees.
Even so, I couldn't do anything but continue with what I was saying.
"We three will make it forever and ever."
That was only an ideal.
I knew the world wasn't so generous that you could live on an ideal.
Of course, Shiona did too.
And yet she didn't show any doubt.
Uneasiness and dissatisfaction.
All such words were locked away.
Surely her mind was filled with those feelings.
In truth, the same feelings were trampling my spirit.
And yet I needed them.
Hopeful words.
Shiona nodded, and held Tipi and I tighter still.
That embrace gave me hope, and courage.
And so we started on our journey to the facility.
"So this is what it's like outside of town..."
Looking out at the wilderness, Tipi clutched her teddy bear to her chest.
"Is it different from the scenery you're used to, Tipi?"
"Yes. When I saw it before, there were streets, and woods, and... and..."
The scenery that Tipi described sounded like the festival days Shiona had talked about, but on a grander scale.
Humans at that time could control not only their town, but also the natural world around them, Phiroids, and even the weather.
"Which means... By the time I started functioning, humans had already started to go into decline..."
Shiona looked a little lonely. Our clothes fluttered around us in the sandy wind.
With a small store of food and an extra battery for Tipi, we set off into the wasteland in order to survive.
To escape from humans.
And most importantly, to live.
We would struggle, and struggle some more, and survive.
We would squirm, writhe, whatever it took to keep on living.
Just living was enough.
There was value in just being alive.
I believed that, from the bottom of my heart.
I started walking from memory, judging the direction by the sun's position, which I could just make out through the dark clouds.
When the sun set and the temperature dropped, the three of us huddled together and slept.
Sometimes we sang, or cheered each other on, or joked around...
Our journey continued, and it wasn't all hardship.
By the time we crossed the rusty plains and reached our destination, three full days had passed, and the sun was just beginning to set.
"The building's half buried in sand... So it won't be discovered. To think that a facility like this was still around..."
When we went inside, a faint light came on, and we heard an air conditioner running somewhere.
The room hadn't changed a bit since I woke up there. I tidied up the Phiroid parts first of all, so that they wouldn't make Shiona and Tipi uncomfortable.
These Phiroids must have protected us humans during our cold sleep.
"Yay, I can sit down!"
Tipi ran forward to sit on the couch.
The moment she sat down, her whole body slumped as the energy left her.
It seemed we'd been pushing her pretty hard.
"...It's kinda cold here."
"Well, it was originally a facility for cold sleep."
Even though we were inside, it was actually a little colder than outside.
Since the air conditioning was working, I hoped that meant that there was also a heating system that still worked.
But I didn't know where that would be.
"I hope there's a heater or something..."
"We can just do this. Rei, sit down next to Tipi."
"Huh? Like this, then?"
"Even closer!"
"H-How's this?"
Now that I was practically pressed up against Tipi, Shiona looked satisfied.
"Yeah, that'll do!"
Then she sat down on the other side of Tipi.
She was pressed up just as close to Tipi as I was.
"See, this feels warm, doesn't it?"
"Y-Yeah... It does."
It definitely was warm. Warm, but...
"How is it? Tipi, are you still cold?"
"Mmm...I'm warm."
Tipi half-closed her eyes in a smile and snuggled closer to my arm.
"You are? Good, I'm glad."
"Yeah, I'm warm... This is so warm, Rei. It's just like..."
"Just like what?"
"When we're like this, it's just like we're a family."
"My mama and papa used to hug me like this."
"I see... They did, huh?"
"Yes. And I would feel warm like this, too."
"You're right, it really is warm."
"...Hey, can you hug me again? Hug me really tight?"
I almost hugged her without thinking, but Shiona's sad expression stopped me.
"Tipi, we can't do that."
"Why? You won't give me a hug?"
"No, we won't. Because we're not your family, Tipi."
"You're not my family... So I'm all alone?"
"That's right. No matter how much time we spend together, you're still all alone. We can't change that."
Based on her words alone, Shiona almost seemed to hate Tipi.
But I finally understood.
Those words were full of kindness.
Tipi had only one emotion left:
Fulfilling Tipi's heartfelt desire would release her from that sadness...
And Tipi would cease to function.
Basically, she would have died.
Up until now, I had hugged Tipi without even thinking.
But that was a cruel kindness.
Or maybe it wasn't even kindness at all.
It was just for my own satisfaction, bringing Tipi closer to her death.
Shiona had resisted all this time.
She had protected Tipi's feelings of sadness... to protect Tipi herself.
I'm sure she really wanted to hug her.
She probably wanted to pat her on the head and speak kindly to her.
She wanted to smile at her until her heart turned orange.
But she resisted, never reaching out to this blue child.
