I wished this time could continue on forever...
This time spent making people smile.
And I wanted to keep watching Shiona's happy face as she sang, forever.
I happened to glance toward the library at the edge of the town.
I thought I saw the closed curtains move a little.
For just a moment, I saw a small figure.
I knew who it was.
That blue girl who was always crying.
It was Tipi.
She was probably crying now, too.
All alone in that library.
Just thinking about it, I felt a small pain in my chest.
It was like a thorn had pricked me.
I wondered what Tipi felt like, watching this crowd of people.
This constantly growing circle of smiles.
Everyone here was smiling and sharing the same emotion.
I noticed just one person among them with a scowl on his face.
It was Madd, with an angry expression and his arms crossed in front of him.
He looked completely out of place, the only one there with an angry expression on his face.
As our eyes unexpectedly met, his were filled with an emotion I still didn't understand.
It didn't even last a whole second.
After an instant, Madd snorted, turned on his heel, and disappeared into the crowd.
And as I watched him go, I thought,
I want to make everyone smile.
Even those who appeared sad or angry.
I wanted to give smiles to Tipi and Madd.
But what could I do?
I continued to think about it as I turned the music box's crank.
After the song was finished, I walked alone to Madd's shop.
I couldn't get his scowl out of my mind.
His shop was as dim and gloomy as ever, and I stepped timidly inside.
There were no customers there.
Madd was sitting alone at the register.
But there was something strange about him.
He wasn't lying back on the chair with legs outstretched as he had before.
He was just staring at something he held in his hand, something square like a chip.
His expression was as stern as ever, but also looked somehow lonely.
"Um... Madd?"
When I spoke to him, Madd looked startled and hurriedly hid the chip inside his hand.
"Uh, hey, why are you here? How come you just barged in here without permission?"
"Barged in? I thought anyone was free to come into a shop..."
"Don't give me that! It takes some gall to come sauntering in here without my permission!!"
He was being highly irrational.
"But for you not to even notice me enter, you must have been concentrating very hard on that chip."
"The chip you're hiding in your hand."
"I'm not hiding anything like that!!"
"But I saw it. If you're not hiding anything, why don't you open your hand and--"
"Shut up! Get out of here! And never ever come back here again!!"
Pushed back by the force of his words, I was kicked out of Madd's shop.
I'd come to try to make Madd smile, but somehow I ended up doing the opposite.
Shiona was waiting for me outside of the shop.
At the sight of her smile, my chest grew a little warmer.
"Huh? Why are you here, Shiona?"
"I wondered where you were going, so I followed you."
"I came here hoping to make Madd smile. But I just made him angry again..."
"You want to make Madd smile, huh? That's a very difficult thing to do. I wouldn't worry about it. Madd's always angry, anyway."
"But he seemed angrier than usual today."
"More than usual? Did something happen?"
"I'm not sure exactly, but I asked about the chip."
"The chip?"
"Yeah, a square chip that fit in the palm of his hand. Madd was staring at it..."
I made a square with my fingers to show the size of the chip Madd had been looking at.
Shiona must have known something about it, because her eyes went wide.
"Did you ask about that chip?"
"Yes. And then he suddenly got all angry."
"Ah, okay, I see. Rei, that couldn't be helped."
"Couldn't be helped? What do you mean?"
"That chip is Madd's treasure."
"Madd's treasure? What's on it?"
"I think it has a movie that Madd's son filmed on it."
"His son's movie? Is Madd's son a movie director?"
"Yes. But he left this town ages ago, and hasn't come back."
Shiona looked out the window as she spoke.
She looked a little troubled, but she was still smiling... It was a complicated expression with a mix of both emotions.
"But why would he just look at the chip? He should watch the actual movie."
"He can't. There's no machine in this town that can play that chip."
"So Madd just stares at it because he wants to watch it but can't?"
"I think that must be it. But he doesn't say so out loud because he's easily embarrassed."
Just then I had a thought.
I thought of a way to bring a smile to the face of even the ever-angry Madd.
"Oh, nothing. I want to make a stop somewhere, Shiona, so go on back without me."
"You want to make a stop?"
"Yes, I want to look something up."
"At the library?"
Shiona seemed somehow surprised.
Maybe she was worried about me, since I wasn't quite used to this town yet.
"I promise I won't be late."
I made a point of telling her that, so I wouldn't burden her with too much worry.
Shiona opened her mouth like she wanted to say something, but then closed it again.
And then just once...For just an instant, she lightly bit her lower lip, then smiled.
"...Okay. Be careful, Rei."
I parted with Shiona in front of Madd's shop, and started walking alone through town.
As usual, the library was dimly lit and full of stagnant air.
I walked straight through the maze-like room without hesitation.
To the blue girl, who was always crying.
"Rei, you're here."
When Tipi saw me, she stood up and came running up to me.
I gently hugged her small frame.
"Yes, I promised, after all."
"Thank you, Rei. I'm so glad."
Tipi buried her face in my stomach.
I could tell that she was crying.
"Tipi, what were you up to?"
"I was drawing. Come here, Rei."
Tipi took my hand, and I followed where she led.
Papers and crayons were scattered around the area where Tipi had been sitting.
There was a half-finished drawing among the papers.
"Did you draw this, Tipi?"
"Yes. I draw a picture every day."
As Tipi spoke, she started working on her drawing again.
I looked at her picture.
It showed a singing girl, and a boy playing a music box.
"Tipi, is this...?"
"It's you and Shiona, Rei. When you were playing music in the plaza."
So Tipi really had been watching us through the curtains after all.
When I imagined Tipi watching us all on her own, for some reason my chest stung a little.
"What is it, Rei? Does something hurt?"
The girl was looking up at me with eyes full of grief.
Trying to comfort her, I put my hand on Tipi's head.
"It's alright. It's nothing. That's a really good drawing."
"Thanks... I'm happy to hear that."
As I patted her head, Tipi drew closer to me.
But her face looked so sad and lonely...
From the bottom of my heart, I wanted to see her smile.
"You said you draw a picture every day. Do you have your other drawings?"
"Yeah, I do. This way, Rei."
Tipi stood up, grabbed my hand, and led me deeper into the library.
And there were her drawings.
Tipi must have put them up herself. Several drawings were displayed quite low on the wall.
"I drew this one yesterday, and this one the day before, and this one the day before that..."
Tipi explained each drawing to me.
There was a picture of a boy and a girl holding hands.
A picture of a boy visiting the girl, and another girl.
Then, a picture of a girl crying all alone.
So that was it.
These drawings were Tipi's diary.
After those first few drawings, picture after picture showed the girl crying alone.
After I came here, Tipi wasn't alone anymore.
In the drawings, the girl's expression seemed to be growing softer.
That must have been an expression of Tipi's own emotions.
But her expression was still full of grief.
I really wanted to make this girl smile as well.
But what could I do to help her?
I couldn't think of an answer.
The only thing I could think of was to spend time with Tipi like this.
"Hey, Rei, what book are you looking for here today?"
Still looking sad, Tipi tugged on my sleeve and looked up at me.
"I'm looking for some equipment that can play a video... Is there a book that could help me with that?"
"Yeah, there is. It's a little far away though."
"Can you show me, please?"
"Sure. Here we go."
Then Tipi spread both her arms wide.
The teddy bear in her right hand was now dangling in the air.
"Hold me."
I picked Tipi up.
Like before, Tipi rubbed her cheek against my chest.
"It's that way, Rei."
I started following her directions to the book I was looking for.
The book was on the second floor of the library.
There was a whole corner of shelves with books about projectors old and new from around the world.
"I'm sure the book you're looking for must be here."
All of the books here were handwritten, like the music box book and the map.
But it seemed there were many kinds of projectors, and some were made to use film or disks.
"What kind are you looking for?"
"Do you know something that can play from a chip about this size?"
I show her the size of Madd's chip with my fingers.
"Hmm... Was it perfectly square? Or was it a square that was missing a corner?"
"I think... one of the corners was cut across diagonally."
I hadn't gotten a really close look at it, so I couldn't say with confidence.
But Tipi gave a little nod.
"Like the shape of the chip Madd has?"
"Yes, I'm talking about Madd's chip."
I was surprised that Tipi knew about Madd, but it wasn't really strange, since he was the owner of the town's general store.
After all, Shiona knew about Madd's chip, too. Maybe the whole town knew.
And maybe everyone also knew that Madd was too stubborn to try to watch it.
"Umm... In that case... Here."
Tipi stood up on her tip-toes, and pointed to a book on a shelf she could just barely reach.
"You're amazing, Tipi! You really do know where every book is."
"Heh heh. I got a compliment!"
Tipi pressed her face against my stomach.
I stroked her head as I picked up the book and looked inside.
It was more like an instruction manual than a book.
Myum Inc. Projectors
It also had clear, simple details about its internal structure and wiring.
Apparently it was a portable oblique projector that could display the content from disks on screens or white walls.
If I could find this machine, I could show Madd the video on his chip.
"Thank you, Tipi. I got the information I wanted."
"Are you going already?"
Tipi looked up at me sadly.
"...Yeah, I'm sorry."
"Nooo! Don't go!"
Maybe Tipi was trying to keep me from leaving.
She grabbed on to me.
Her innocent warmth shook my resolve.
But I had to leave.
Right then, I wanted to make Madd happy.
I wanted to see Madd smile.
"Tipi, I promise. I swear I'll come back tomorrow."
"Tomorrow...? Really...?"
"Yes, really. I promise."
"You won't disappear?"
"No, I won't disappear. I promise, I'll come every day."
"...Okay. I'll be waiting for you."
Reluctantly, I left the blue girl Tipi alone in the library.
"You again! Just what did you come here for!?"
The moment I entered the shop, I was met by Madd's anger.
I wanted to run away and escape.
I wanted to cover my ears.
But I didn't.
Because I wanted to grant Madd's wish.
"Madd, I have a favor to ask. Please lend me your son's chip."
"That chip with your son's movie on it."
"Why would I lend it to you!? Don't make me laugh!!"
"Please... I'm begging you."
"You've butted in enough already! Just cut it out already!"
"I... I just want to do something useful for you, Madd!!"
"Something useful?"
Madd's glare grew even grimmer, activating my fear emotion, and I felt my throat contract.
The power left the moving parts in my knees, and I felt dizzy.
I wanted to run away... but I couldn't falter now.
"I heard from Shiona about that chip. She said that your son left this town to be a movie director. That's a movie that your son sent, right? But you don't have a machine to play it, so you haven't seen it, right?"
I pushed back my fear and spoke quickly.
Perhaps put off guard by my rush of words, Madd looked at me, a bit of surprise in his eyes.
"I just went to the library. I looked up the type of projector needed to play it."
"You... went to the library?"
When I mentioned the library, Madd looked even more surprised.
"Yes... I'll look for a machine that can play that chip. Even if the projector is broken, I'll fix it. If I can't find one, I'll find the parts and make a new one."
"Why would you do all that? It has nothing to do with you."
"It may have nothing to do with me, but I want to do it."
"I just want to do something helpful for you... That's all. So please."
It was silent for a while.
Was this silence an acknowledgement, or...
"He was an awful, idiot son."
Madd sat down on his chair and looked up at the ceiling.
He started speaking to me, sounding a little sad.
He and I always fought.
Every time we saw each other, we ended up in an argument.
So he started avoiding me.
Or maybe I was the one avoiding him.
At any rate, we got to where we wouldn't even look at each other.
So when he told me he wanted to talk with me, I was surprised.
"I'm leaving this town."
"Leaving town? What are you talking about?"
"I'm going to leave town and become a movie director. I really love movies."
"Stop dreaming and look at the real world. You could never be a director. There's no way you could cut it."
"You don't know that for sure! I'll never know unless I try!"
"I do know. I'm your dad. Nobody wants to watch a movie made by a director with no talent."
"There are people who have noticed me! I've done things! You just won't admit it!"
"I can't even dream when I'm in this town!"
"A town like this? You wanna say that one more time?"
"I'll say it as many times as you want. Because I can't stand staying in a shop like this, in a town like this, living a life like this!"
"You... You watch what you're..."
"I'll say it as many times as you want! You're just afraid of change!"
"Ever since Mom died, every day you've done the same exact--"
Without thinking, I punched him.
"...Yeah, just like that. Always with the violence. I've had enough."
"...Then go."
"Yeah, that's what I'll do. And you just keep on doing the same old thing forever here."
My son left our house.
And he never contacted me even once after that.
The only thing he sent me was this movie on a chip.
Just how did he expect me to watch it without a machine to play it?
He was so selfish. I could never forgive him.
I didn't want to watch his movie.
And I especially didn't want to see his face.
I was surprised at Madd talking so uncharacteristically.
But the more I heard of his feelings, the more strongly I felt my own.
If Madd really hated his son, he had no reason to carry around a chip he couldn't play.
And if his son really hated him, he wouldn't have sent his movie.
I knew he wanted Madd to see his movie.
I was sure that he had put real feeling into it when he sent Madd that chip.
That was why I wanted to show that movie to Madd.
I bowed my head again.
"Please! Lend me the chip!"
Madd walked up to me wordlessly.
I was prepared for him to scream at me, but I wasn't scared anymore.
My will to help him was stronger than my fear.
But then Madd handed me the chip in his hand.
"Do whatever the hell you want."
Once again, I stared at the chip he had handed me.
It was a metallic core covered by organic glass, with rainbow-colored electronic circuits.
I recalled the chip from my information. It was a general purpose chip used to backup Phiroid memories.
Since it had become a global standard, most makers used this format.
That means it should be playable even without a Myum projector.
I clutched the chip tightly in my head, and bowed in the direction Madd had gone.
The disused factory outside of town.
I stepped into the pile of trash behind the factory.
I figured that this was the only place where I might find a machine to play Madd's chip.
If there had been one in town, he would have already used it.
There were lots of machines in among the junk.
Some had broken cords, or had rusted over.
They all looked totally unusable.
It seemed unlikely that I would find the projector I was looking for here. But I thought I could find a circuit board or maybe some parts.
With those, I could make a new machine to play the chip, just as I'd said to Madd.
This was the only place I could count on.
If I couldn't do something here, then Madd's expression would stay as it was forever.
I couldn't let that happen.
I didn't want to let that happen.
With that sole thought in mind, I dug through the mountain of scrap.
But no matter how much I searched, I couldn't find a likely piece of equipment.
Madd himself had probably searched at some point.
No... Perhaps Madd was still searching even then.
Shiona had told me how Madd would fix things he found in this garbage dump and sell them at the shop.
But maybe the real reason was to find a projector to play the chip from his son.
If that were the case, then how must Madd feel having been unable to find it after all this time...?
Picking up other things instead of a projector... What could he be thinking while he fixed them?
And while he was feeling that way, I broke his clock.
Ah... I see... So that's why he was so angry.
To Madd, that clock was a part of the process for restoring something important.
I was just speculating. However, I was hoping it was true.
Because if it was, then it wouldn't be easy for me to find the thing Madd had spent so much time searching for.
But I wasn't going to give up.
Since I had broken his clock, finding the projector Madd was looking for would be a grand form of redemption...
Just as I was dragging a huge piece of machinery, bigger than myself...
I felt something strange in my right hand.
It was just a slight feeling... One of the joints in my fingers felt a little awkward.
Perhaps it was out of oil, or maybe something had broken.
It might not have been a good idea to continue working.
I couldn't make myself stop.
Madd must have searched the entire area that stretched out before me.
I looked up at the pile of scrap that towered over me.
As I was lighter than Madd, I could probably climb it.
With that thought, I began to climb up the misshapen stairs that the scrap had formed.
I could feel water hitting my back.
When I looked up at the sky, large raindrops were pouring down.
"Rei, please stop."
I heard a voice from down below me.
I turned around, and Shiona was there.
She was getting soaked by the rain as she looked up at me.
"It's raining. You'll catch a cold if you keep this up."
"I'm okay. Thanks, but I'll search a little longer."
"Even if you don't find it, Madd will be happy that you tried so hard for him."
"It's all right, Shiona. Just a little longer."
I kept searching.
From behind me, Shiona continued our one-sided exchange.
"But you're already soaked. Please stop. Aren't you tired? No one will be upset at you if you give up, Rei."
She spoke soothingly.
"I'm worried about your health. Please stop? I'd be sad if you got hurt, Rei....It's important to know when to quit, you know."
"There may be another way. Let's go home for today. I made some orange powapowa soup."
"Let's go home... Rei, come on... Please, Rei... I'm worried about you, Rei..."
But still I continued.
Refusing to give in to the pouring rain, I kept searching.
I pulled up a decayed iron plate.
As I did so, a small scrap avalanche started to fall.
Scrap metal rolled down with a roar, stabbing into the ground at my feet, and I dodged backwards.
"Rei, look out!"
I turned around at the sound of Shiona's voice, and saw the mountain of scrap behind me coming down towards me.
The pile behind me had started an avalanche as well.
It seemed about to swallow me up, but I somehow managed to climb on top of the scrap as it crumbled down around me.
After a while the rumbling stopped, and only the sound of the rain remained.
"Rei, are you okay? You're not hurt?"
"No, I'm okay... That was close."
"It really was... I'm so glad you're safe. I'm so glad..."
Shiona's voice was filled with relief.
I stood up, as if to prove to her that I was all right.
"Oh... Rei, look."
Shiona pointed to spot close to my feet, her eyes wide.
It was the pile of trash that had just come crashing down. In it was a familiar-looking machine.
It was the same as the machine in the book that Tipi showed me.
I dug it out to look at it, and engraved on the front was the label "Myum".
"This is it... Shiona, here it is! It was here after all!"
I lifted it up high so that Shiona could see.
As I tilted it, water poured out from inside the machine.
"I've got it! I've got it, Shiona! I finally found it! Now Madd can finally watch that movie!"
"Yes, but... I think that machine's broken...?"
"Wait, what?"
At Shiona's words, I brought the machine close to my face to look at it.
She was right. The machine we found - the "Myum Inc. projector" - was clearly broken.
It was missing the lens needed to project.
There was also a large crack on the top, and when I peered inside it, I could see that the parts inside were covered in rust.
I couldn't show a movie with this.
"It's a shame... But Rei, let's go home, okay?"
Shiona held her hand out to me.
I took her hand in my own.
Her warmth sunk into my hand, which had grown cold in the rain.
When we reached the town again, the rain had stopped.
But my mood was still cloudy.
I wondered if I could really fix the projector I carried in my arms.
I fully intended to fix it, but when I saw the damaged machine with my own eyes, I felt my resolve falter.
"What are you doing all soaked like that?"
He called out to us suddenly, as we were on our way back to the church.
When we turned around, we saw the photographer who had taken our picture before.
"I was just looking for something."
"Looking for something? I see. So did you find it?"
"Yes... but..."
"Is something wrong?"
"He did find it, but it's so broken he can't use it."
I was feeling too discouraged to speak, so Shiona answered for me.
"Now I see. That's too bad. By the way, what were you planning to use it for?"
"Actually... I was hoping to play the chip that Madd always carries around."
"Madd? Oh, the chip his son sent him, right?"
"Yes. I wanted to make Madd happy instead of angry all the time, but..."
"You truly wanted to do that?"
The photographer asked kindly, but also as though he was testing me.
"Yes, of course."
I answered without hesitation.
"Madd... he always looks so angry. I think he's in a lot of pain. But I think if he just had the chance, he could smile. And I think that if people can smile, they can be happy. And then other people who see that can be happy too."
After saying all that, I looked at Shiona.
"I... learned that from Shiona."
Shiona looked surprised at my words, but then immediately smiled.
Yes, that was the expression. That was the face that could spread to others, making the people around them happy.
The moment Shiona smiled, my own heart grew warm.
"I see... Could you show that to me, please?"
The photographer pointed at the projector I was carrying. I silently held out the broken machine.
The photographer looked it over closely.
"I see. This is really bad. And it's missing too many parts to be fixed."
I felt crushed hearing the photographer, someone who regularly maintains cameras, declare it beyond repair.
He must have noticed how depressed I felt, and he gave a pained smile as he passed the projector back to me.
"Rei, let's hurry home, okay? We'll catch a cold."
"That's right. It's not good for you to sit around so wet from the rain. You should go home for now and get into some dry clothes."
If I asked anything more, I'd be bothering the photographer as well.
I might be fine, but as a human, Shiona could catch a cold.
I clutched the projector close and bowed to the photographer, and we headed back to the church.
When we got back to the church, Shiona dried my hair with a fluffy towel.
She dried me off quickly and kindly, taking care not to scratch.
"It's too bad about the projector."
"Yeah, but it was a trash heap, after all. It's no wonder that it was broken."
I should have thought of that in the first place. But I had just hoped that everything would go well.
I thought if I wished for it, that it would work out. That if I tried hard enough, I'd get the results I wanted.
But I was learning that reality wasn't so kind.
"It can't be helped. You tried your hardest, Rei. No one will complain."
"But... But, I wanted to show the movie to Madd."
"Yeah... You're really kind, Rei."
"It's not a question of kindness or anything. I just think that that's what I'm supposed to do."
"But just knowing you feel that way will make Madd happy. That's enough."
"I hope so, but..."
"At any rate, let's warm up, okay? I'll go get a drink to warm up both your body and your mood."
Shiona walked toward the kitchen with a smile, folding up the towel she'd used to dry my hair.
I sat down in a chair and sighed.
I looked at the broken projector on the table.
...But there was no point in getting depressed.
Even though it was broken, when I thought about it, it was better than nothing.
Even if it took a long time, if I could fix this projector little by little, eventually I should be able to play the chip.
The book I borrowed from Tipi had instructions for disassembly, to be used for maintenance.
If I followed it closely, I should be able to fix the projector.
As for the missing parts, I could search for them one by one at the factory.
I wanted Madd to smile. I wanted to see him make the face that Shiona made when I fixed the music box.
Once again, I strengthened my resolve to fix the projector.
Just after that, I noticed a commotion in the main part of the church.
"Pardon me."
When I opened the door and looked inside, I saw the photographer.
And behind him were many other townspeople.
"What's going on?"
As I asked curiously, the townspeople approached me with smiles on their faces and held out their hands.
"This is a piece of my broken clock. Please use it if you can."
"I thought this wire might be a match."
"You can use my light."
"No, use my light."
"I have lots of tools at my house, so please use them as much as you like."
All sorts of pieces of electrical equipment and wiring, circuits, gears, and screws started piling up on the table.
I stood there dumbfounded, unable to understand what was going on, and the photographer smiled brightly.
"Um... What's all this?"
"You're going to fix that projector, right? When I told the others, they brought along some things they thought you might need. You might not need all these things, but it's always good to have some extra supplies, right?"
"But why...?"
"These are all people who were moved by the song you and Shiona performed. They wanted to thank you. And I'm one of them as well."
The photographer took out a lens, and put it in my hand.
"This... It's a camera lens, but it might fit."
I felt something warm inside my chest.
I felt it building up more and more.
Then the warmth reached the back of my eyes, growing hotter and hotter.
I couldn't seem to find any words to say. I wanted to speak, but my lips just trembled.
Shiona looked at me kindly, holding a steaming cup.
"Shiona... My chest feels so warm. Why?"
"Rei, that's because you're feeling happy."
As she spoke, Shiona came up to me and handed me the cup full of warm, fragrant liquid.
"You wanted to make Madd smile, and this is everyone's response. Everyone else wants to make Madd smile too, through you."
"I'm not causing problems, am I...? I just went ahead and started all this without asking."
"If they thought this was a problem, they wouldn't all be smiling so warmly."
I looked at each of the people who brought me supplies.
They held up the supplies in their hands so I could see them, and smiled at me.
"Everyone... Thank you so much."
I got to work on the repairs right there, using the supplies and tools they brought.
When I reached a spot I didn't understand by myself, someone would help me, and I made progress.
I dried the machine off, and carefully filed off the rust. I fixed the broken circuits with copper foil.
I heated up a screwdriver until it was red-hot, and used it to fix the detached solder.
"No, not like that, like this."
"No, no, this part should go this way."
"You're both wrong! It's definitely this way!"
Not like this, not like that.
It was noisy, but happy and lively, as we all did the repairs together.
And finally...
It was patched up and cobbled together; ugly, but fixed.
"Thank you so much, everyone."
"Don't worry about it. Just let us hear that song again sometime in exchange."
"My children loved it. Please play it again."
"It really set the mood for me and my boyfriend."
"When I heard that song... it reminded me of old times."
"That song is so fun. I love it!"
The machine we built together was not a pretty one.
It looked quite different from the pictures in the book.
But it was the only projector in the world that we had all built together.
I felt as happy as I think it's possible to feel.
Everyone there was happy to see it complete.
"Now all you have to do is test it."
At his words, I looked around the room.
When I thought of it, I hadn't seen any electricity in this town.
The photographer used an analog camera as well.
"Umm, could it be that there's no electricity in this town...?"
Everyone looked startled by my question.
