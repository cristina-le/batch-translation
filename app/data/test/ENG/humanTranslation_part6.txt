She wasn't where I knew she always was.
The teddy bear which was always by her side was also missing.
The only thing there was an unfinished picture and the crayons she had used to draw it.
The drawing was of a lone girl crying.
Where could Tipi have gone?
I searched the surrounding bookshelves but couldn't find her.
Wherein the library could she have been?
Or could she have been outside?
I didn't know the truth.
And I wouldn't if I didn't try to look for Tipi.
I started to walk again.
Weaving through the bookshelves, I looked for the blue girl.
The immense library was not the best place to try to find someone.
On top of that, it was incredibly dark.
Just looking from the ends of the bookshelves was not enough.
I had to check the entire library step by step to be sure.
I marched through all the rows of bookshelves heading back towards the entrance.
My once-soaked clothes had begun to dry.
Then, when my hair was fully dried...
Finally, I found the young girl.
Standing atop a large stepladder, she was organizing books.
As a resident of the library, she was the acting librarian.
She was placing the books the townspeople had returned in their original places.
It was intense labor for this tiny girl.
The thousands of bookshelves in the library were packed with books nearly up to the ceiling, and were lined up end-to-end.
I didn't even want to consider the total amount of books.
The young girl faced this mass of books and went about organizing them every day.
All alone inside this library.
Once that thought entered my head, a deep, twisting pain began to surge within my chest.
Tipi stood on top of the stepladder, stretching out to return a book that was larger than her head.
Once the book was back in place, she took a breath and turned around, facing me.
"Rei! Wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-whoa..."
Upon seeing me, Tipi lost her balance.
"Tipi, watch out!"
The stepladder fell.
Tipi's arms stretched out.
I sent out both of my own in response.
The shock rolled in through my chest and out through my back.
The next thing I knew, I was lying on my back on the floor, holding Tipi in my arms.
"Rei... You came to see me!"
Tipi pressed her cheek against my chest and rubbed it back and forth.
Relieved, I began to pat Tipi's head.
Her soft hair welcomed my fingers.
"Tipi, does anything hurt? Are you okay?"
"Yeah, I'm fine. What about you, Rei?"
"I'm fine. Thanks for asking."
"You saved me, Rei... You're the greatest..."
Her small hands were gripping my clothes.
A little bit of warmth began to spread throughout my chest.
Tipi was crying.
But these tears were different from the usual.
These were tears of relief.
My being there must have made Tipi feel a bit better.
Realizing that sent a surge of joy through me.
"I've been arranging the books. That's great, right? Isn't it?"
"Yeah, it really is. You're a real good kid."
"Hey, keep patting my head. I'm a good kid, right? So please keep patting my head."
"Yeah... You're good, Tipi... A real good kid..."
I kept patting her silky hair.
"Yay... Thank you for doing this, Rei. I'm so happy..."
"Do you always organize the books?"
"Yes. I'm always taking care of the books. Because I want lots and lots of people to read them."
I looked up at the shelves.
A fair number of them were particularly old.
The spines were worn and the colors were faded.
Tipi was taking care of these...
I recalled the time I had let a book get wet in the rain.
By not taking care of it, I was making Tipi's work harder.
I vowed to always take good care of them.
I sat up and leaned against the nearest bookshelf.
"I'm sorry it took so long or me to come."
"That's okay... Because you did come."
"Were you okay all by yourself?"
"No... I was really lonely."
"Have you been crying?"
"Yeah... Yeah, I have..."
Tipi pressed her face into my chest.
I could hear the occasional sob.
"It's okay, Tipi. I'm going to be with you from now on."
"Forever? Are you going to stay with me forever, Rei?"
"Yeah, that's right. I'll come to the library as often as I can."
"You can't live with me?"
Tipi looked up at me.
Giant tears were welling in her eyes.
"That would be a little difficult. Right now Shiona is helping me a lot."
"But I'll come every day. That should make you feel a bit less lonely, right?"
"Yeah... But I feel really lonely at night."
"Oh, at night..."
"It's dark, and cold... And I feel like I'm the only person left in the world."
"That's not true. That's not true at all..."
All I could do was hold Tipi tightly.
I noticed a sweet smell from Tipi.
It was a different sweet scent from Shiona's.
"Yeah, I know... Even if you just come see me, I'll be happy. Hey, Rei. Can I ask you something?"
"Sure, Tipi. What is it?"
"Can you help me?"
"Yeah, of course. No problem at all."
I stood up and held Tipi's hand.
I pushed a cart filled with a number of books as we walked through the library.
"Next is... Um, a book called 'The Philosophy of Body and Mind'."
"That one would be E-Z-493. Three shelves from the top, and the thirteenth book from the right."
Immediately after hearing a book's title, Tipi could say where it belonged.
It was as if she knew everything about all of the library's books.
There was an opening for a book in the exact location she had specified.
It fit perfectly as I slid it in.
Tipi wasn't guessing with any of this.
She spoke the location of each book with a deep confidence.
This piqued my interest, and I decided to ask her a question that was a touch mean.
"Hey, Tipi, can I ask you something?"
"Do you know the beginning to this novel?"
In my hand was a fairly old-looking novel.
Staring at the title, Tipi began to recite as if she had opened the book in her own mind.
"I looked down from a height of five stories. Right beside the school building was a spread of cream-colored bricks that formed a walkway that looked to offer pleasing walks. Beside the walkway was a bed of flowers, and even from this height the splendor if its colors could be seen. If I were to throw myself from here, the cream-colored bricks, the color of the flowers, all of them would be painted with my filthy blood."
Tipi had recited it verbatim.
Each and every handwritten character from the novel.
"Do you remember every single book here?"
"Um... I don't know."
"Well, how about this book?"
Glancing at the book I held out, Tipi's began to recite smoothly.
"The human body contains 206 bones. Starting with the head is the occipital bone, frontal skull bone, temporal bone, parietal bone, sphenoid bone, ethmoid, malleus, incus, stapes, inferior concha, lacrimal bone, nasal bone, vomer, maxilla, palatine, zygomatic bone, jawbone, and hyoid bone, thus connecting to the cervical vertebra, dorsal vertebra, lumbar vertebra, sacral vertebra, caudal vertebra, costa, and from there, the sternum."
"How about this one?"
I pointed to another handwritten book claiming to be the Corpus of Pi.
"How about this 'Soulless Child Theory' book?"
"All things have limits, and the soul is no exception. Children born after the depletion of souls would be soulless instruments. Edward Morgue."
Tipi had memorized every book in this library.
But how?
Even if she had such a tremendous memory, first she would have had to read all of the books.
Even if she read all day every day, it would be impossible to consume the entirety of this sea of books.
What could this all mean?
"Rei, what's wrong?"
"Oh, nothing. Let's take care of the remaining books."
There was no point in thinking about things I couldn't answer.
At the time, I dedicated myself to helping Tipi do her job.
After all the books were back in place, we sat in our usual spot.
"Thank you for helping me, Rei."
Tipi was being sweeter on me than usual.
I wondered if it was because we hadn't met for some time.
She seemed both cute and vulnerable in her dependence on me.
"It's alright, Tipi. You always do this by yourself, right?"
"Yeah... I have for a long, long time. It's so lonely."
"How long have you been by yourself?"
I probably shouldn't have asked that.
Tipi looked up at me with sad eyes.
"I've been alone since a long, long time ago."
Tipi began to talk.
She told me the sad story of how she came to be all alone.
"Papa, Mama."
The story was from when Tipi's parents were still at the library.
The young girl loved them.
She loved her kind mother and father.
Her mother was always smiling, and held Tipi with such gentle care.
Her father always lovingly gazed upon the two of them as he organized the books.
"Oh, Tipi, I'm always spoiling you."
Her father pulled an electronic book reader from the desk.
"Oh, is that so? So you like these books better?"
He put the device away with a wry smile, and instead took a "book" made from paper.
It was an old book, with a cover and pages that showed the wear of being read time and time again.
"Ah, Tipi, come here."
Her mother had called Tipi to sit on her lap, which she did happily.
And then on top of Tipi's lap was a teddy bear her parents had picked out for her.
Tipi enjoyed every day.
Every day with her beloved parents was wonderful.
Every day she felt content.
Tipi's mother always praised her artwork.
"You're definitely going to become an artist. You make your father really proud, Tipi."
Her father always had great hope for her future.
She wanted those days to continue forever.
She wanted to live like that. Just the three of them, together forever.
That was what Tipi thought every day.
Before she knew it, there were more and more days when her parents would frown and wrinkle their brows.
Tipi didn't like to see her parents' faces that way.
The town also began to seem hurried.
All the adults seemed to be talking about something together.
But young Tipi didn't understand any of it.
The only thing she knew was an increasing feeling that her life up until now was about to crumble.
One day, the phone rang.
To Tipi, it was an incredibly sad sound.
After her father picked up the phone, wrinkles began to form on his brow.
He had that expression that Tipi didn't like.
After hanging up the phone, her father began to speak with her mother.
After a while, that conversation became an argument.
They were fighting about something.
The only thing she did know was that seeing the two of them talk to each other like that made her incredibly sad.
"Tipi, could you come here?"
For a while after, her mother stared at Tipi with a solemn look upon her face.
Behind her mother was her father, and behind him was a collection of luggage.
Tipi had realized that her life would no longer be as it had for so long.
"Bad things are happening in the world right now."
"Many people are scared, and can't sleep night after night. That's terrible, right Tipi?"
"There are children all over the world who feel the same. I want to do what I can for them."
"Yes... And I thought that you would say that, Tipi. Now, the next thing I am going to talk to you about is very important. It's okay if you don't understand. Will you listen?"
"Well, the truth is your father and I have to go far away in order to help those children. Even if we go, there is still a chance that nothing will change... But there is a chance it will."
"No. Much farther than that. This place is so far away that it can take many days or even weeks to get there."
When Tipi began heading to her room, her father stopped her.
"Tipi, you don't need to prepare to travel."
"No... Actually, Tipi, your mother and I are the only ones going. Just the two of us."
"Just the two...? What about me?"
Her parents exchanged glances.
Tipi began to get a feeling from the sad look on her parents' faces.
Her eyes suddenly welled up with tears.
"Sorry, Tipi, but we can't do that."
"Because we are going to a very dangerous place. And we don't want to bring you to a place like that. Because you are very important to both of us, Tipi."
"No... No, no, no, no, no... I'm going with you..."
Tipi's parents gently embraced her.
"I'm sorry, Tipi... But we have to go."
"We're both so sorry... But it's okay. We'll be back as soon as we can."
"Very soon... We'll come back so soon that you won't even have time to be lonely."
"Tipi, you're a good girl, so I want you to stay here take care of things. And I want you to keep showing us your drawings."
"That's right. Draw a picture every day. Whatever you see, hear, think, or feel. And then when we come back, I want you to tell us about them."
"Right. And I'll make books from the stories of our travels. And I'll come back so I can read them to you."
"Yes, as real as real can be. I promise you, so..."
The three embraced.
None of them knew how long they would be apart, and they embraced to soothe the pain of their separation.
How long had it been since then?
Tipi continued to draw pictures just like her father had asked.
Each picture she drew, she hung on the wall. They were hung so that her parents would see them as soon as they came back.
The things she saw...
The things she heard...
The things she thought...
The things she felt...
But eventually, these were all buried under thoughts about her parents.
She wanted to be held, to have her hair stroked, her name called, and... She wanted to see them... Soon...
Her heart grew bluer and bluer.
As she cried, the young girl drew pictures...
Tipi told me of her unfortunate past while tears streamed down her face.
Her tiny shoulders shuddered for a fleeting moment.
In front of me was a young girl plagued by sadness.
I couldn't even come close to understanding the depth of what she felt.
Probably because I had never felt sadness to such an extreme.
That's why I couldn't understand Tipi's emotions.
I knew there was a way I could I soothe her pain.
If I just held onto her tightly.
That would do it.
Tipi was sitting with her back against the wall.
I stretched out my hand to her delicate body.
When I touched her shoulders, Tipi jumped a bit.
But it was not in rejection.
My quick movement in the darkness had just startled her.
"You're okay, Tipi. Don't worry."
"Rei, you're not going to disappear, are you?"
"I won't disappear."
"And you won't leave me by myself?"
"I won't leave you by yourself."
"And you won't make me lonely?"
"I won't make you lonely."
"And you won't make me sad?"
"I won't make you sad."
"Will you be nice to me?"
"I'll be nice to you."
"Will you hold me?"
"Yes, I'll hold you."
"Will you pick me up?"
"Yes, I'll pick you up."
"Will you pat my head?"
"Yes, I'll pat your head."
"Will you hold my hand?"
"Yes, I'll hold your hand."
"Will you stay with me forever?"
Tipi's eyes seemed to glow dimly in the darkness.
Her shoulders began to get really hot.
I held Tipi close to my body.
"My, my. Aren't you two getting close?"
A voice reverberated in the darkness, making no attempt to sooth the young girl's sadness.
Although we parted ways at the entrance, it was Shiona's voice.
I noticed Shiona was standing nearby.
Even through the darkness I could make out a faint smile as she made her way toward us.
"But that's certainly too close for comfort. You're both adolescents, after all."
Shiona took my hand off of Tipi.
"No... No..."
Tipi's face hung with sorrow as my arm was pulled away from her.
Without thinking, I raised my voice at Shiona.
"Shiona, what are you doing!?"
"What's gotten into you? Why are you so angry? You've got to think before you get physical with young girls."
"That's not what's happening. Tipi was just sad... I was trying to do whatever I could to ease her pain."
"She's sad? About what?"
"Because her parents haven't returned yet! She's been waiting here all alone. She's been isolated and lonely the whole time!"
"Well, that's just how it is. There's nothing we can do."
"What do you mean there's nothing we can do? What are you talking about..."
Shiona walked over to Tipi.
And then she looked down at the sorrowful girl.
"Hey, Tipi. Sorry to break it to you, but you're going to be alone forever. From now until the end of time."
She said that smiling, like it was nothing.
"Shiona... What in the...?"
"You get it, right Tipi? You know, how your mom and dad aren't coming back?"
"Shiona... Just stop... Why are you saying such horrible things...?"
"You've got to have noticed by now, Tipi. You just can't handle the truth."
"No... It's... No..."
"Tipi, your mom and dad are..."
"Shiona... Don't..."
"They're already dea..."
"I TOLD YOU TO STOP!!"
My voice rung through the library.
My whole body was hot.
My breathing became erratic, and I felt a pain growing in my head.
I gritted my teeth so hard they began to make noises.
I felt like lights were flashing in front of me, and I could barely stand up.
But there was one thing I was certain of, right then.
I felt my chest getting fiery red. Kind of like how Madd must have felt.
This was the emotion called "anger."
I felt anger boiling inside me due to the injustice unfolding in front of me.
She had just dashed all of the little blue girl's hopes.
With her cruel words, she had hurt Tipi deeply.
Tipi cried, but her voice could not escape her mouth.
Her face became drenched.
Her sadness took the form of massive tears, which began streaming from her cheeks.
Her reaction made it clear that she was gripped by a boundless sadness that tore at her very soul.
Shiona continued to bash her verbally.
"I mean, come on. Do you even know how long Tipi's parents have been gone for?"
"Tipi, you've been drawing pictures every day, yeah? How many have you drawn by now?"
"I said stop..."
"Don't you get even more depressed, drawing each day? You're probably thinking, 'I wonder how many more I have to draw until mommy and daddy come back'."
"Just... Stop..."
"It doesn't matter how much you cry. Because in the end, you're just crying to soothe yourself. Just because you're crying doesn't mean anything is going to change."
"Please stop..."
"So cry to your heart's content. You're doing it because you want someone to feel pity for you. But the truth is that you're just running away from reality."
"Please... Please stop..."
"Just grow the hell up already. Your mom and dad aren't coming back. Never again. That's right. You won't see your parents ever again, Tipi."
"I guess I should tell you. Rei's only here because he takes pity on you. It's not because he cares about you like your parents loved you. He's only here because he's bound by pity for you. Do you get it now, Tipi? You're all alone."
"SHUT UP!!"
My roar echoed.
After it bounced from wall to wall and dissipated, only Tipi's soft crying lingered on.
Tipi's empty eyes looked up at Shiona.
I felt like the light that had once shown through them had vanished.
"Rei, pampering someone and consoling someone are two different things."
"That's not... It's not what I..."
"Rei, just accept it. Tipi's parents are no longer alive."
"There's no way that's... true..."
"So then, why do you think they haven't contacted her even once? You think they wouldn't write a single letter to their precious, adorable little princess?"
"Well... They're most likely very busy and..."
"Wouldn't you make the time if you knew someone you loved was worried? ESPECIALLY if it's your own kid. The fact that they haven't means that they're..."
"Please... Just stop..."
"dead. Tipi's parents are definitely dead."
I froze in place.
The way she said it was as normal as ever. She was still smiling and her voice was gentle.
It would even have been better if she had said it coldly.
The whole situation put me at a loss for words.
Still smiling, Shiona turned her sights onto Tipi again.
"Tipi, the only ones in your family are you and your parents. But they aren't coming back. Which means that even if you're with someone, you'll never be whole again. Even if Rei were with you, he could never be your family. And that's something you can never change. Forever and ever, you will always be alone."
Shiona turned on her heel and made her way toward the entrance.
On her way there, she turned and looked toward me over her shoulder.
But she kept her gaze on the floor.
"Rei... This is all for you."
After saying that, she left the library.
Silence fell over the library.
I could only hear Tipi weeping softly.
I had gone mad with rage over what Shiona had said, and felt drained.
I couldn't even stand up.
But, there was a little girl crying next to me.
I couldn't just leave her as she was at the time.
She probably had a lot on her mind.
Like how she was all alone in the world.
Or how she was going to live a life of loneliness.
I didn't want her to think those things.
I wanted her to know that she wasn't alone.
The feelings I had for her weren't pity.
They weren't even close to that.
I sat there for a bit thinking of what to say.
I reached my hand out for Tipi's shoulder.
I hugged her delicate shoulders.
At first Tipi seemed startled, but then she fell into my chest.
She pushed her face against it, and continued to weep silently.
All I could do was pat her quivering shoulders over and over.
If only there was a way make her feel better, even for just a moment...
I didn't know how long we stayed like that.
We just sat and held each other.
After a while, I began to lose track of time.
Then Tipi got up unsteadily and began walking, seemingly looking for something.
She didn't answer.
It was a sketch book and crayons.
She brought them over to where I was sitting.
She sat right in front of me, and put her back to my stomach.
She still didn't answer.
Instead, she flipped through the pages.
She settled on a brand new page, and held a crayon in her hand.
Without a moment's hesitation, she began dragging the crayon across the paper.
She started drawing something cute that a kid her age would draw.
She first drew a little blue girl.
She had tears streaming down her cheeks.
Her eyes were a bit swollen and red.
I gently petted her head,
She lowered her gaze, and began drawing again.
Next, she began drawing a person similar to myself.
His hands were on the little girl's head.
It looked like he was patting her on the head.
She drew one more person.
It was Shiona.
She was a bit off to the side, and had a scary expression on her face as she looked at the young girl.
That was Shiona, according to Tipi.
Even to me, that was how Shiona had looked when facing Tipi.
Why did she do those terrible things?
Also, what did she mean by saying that?
"This is all for you."
I had no idea what that meant.
Actually, I didn't want to know.
She went and made Tipi cry, so I had no idea how it was for me.
Would making someone sad actually make me happy?
No, there was no way that was true.
It was something that shouldn't be true.
In order to get Shiona's words out of my head, I hugged Tipi harder.
Her voice was so faint I barely heard it.
Even still, I could sense a hint of happiness in it.
I thought about something as I gazed at the picture.
Maybe this was the only way Tipi could escape her sadness.
People dreamed when their days were over.
Basically, it was said that dreams existed for the brain to record and process the events of the day.
Maybe for Tipi, this picture worked like that.
The things that transpired that day...
From good times to bad times, she drew it all.
Maybe organizing her memories was a way for her to calm down.
In fact, she looked a lot more peaceful.
As she progressed with the picture, her sadness slowly faded.
It was almost as if her sadness was transferred to the picture.
She took my hand as she stood up.
She led me to an entire wall covered with her pictures.
Every day she would draw just one.
There were just too many to count by now.
She put the picture she drew that day on the endmost part of the wall.
Another picture to add to the massive collection.
I felt like the wall of drawings was almost a diary chronicling her isolation.
She had been adding to this story, day by day, all alone.
A terribly sad story, chronicled in isolation.
With that thought, I felt something rising in my chest.
My voice caught in my throat reflexively when I looked at her sorrowful face.
Instead of answering, I held Tipi close.
After a moment I could hear her breathing softly, asleep.
My gaze went back and forth between Tipi and the wall covered in pictures.
Perhaps these drawings were a direct representation of her heart.
Occupied with such thoughts, I found myself drifting off to sleep.
It was the church I was living at.
I stood in front of those large, familiar white doors.
I opened the doors with both hands.
The inside of the chapel was choked by an oppressive silence.
Actually, it wasn't completely silent.
The faint sound of crying could still be heard.
I made my way through the chapel.
There, I came face to face with the source of the sounds.
It was someone who always had a smile on her face.
Her frail shoulders shuddered as she cried.
There wasn't any trace of her usual smile.
I couldn't hide my shock.
Why was she crying?
I didn't know the reason.
Whatever the case, Shiona was crying right in front of me.
They weren't fake tears.
And even then I couldn't do anything.
Actually, that wasn't the case.
There was something I could do.
I stretched out my hand.
My fingers extended toward Shiona's eyes.
There was nothing I could do to stop her tears.
But I could wipe them away.
But that was all I could do...
I reached out to one large tear.
But my hand suddenly stopped.
My fingers... They were made of mechanical parts.
My extended index finger was gleaming and metallic...
Ah, that was right.
I had forgotten.
No, I wanted to forget.
I wasn't a human.
I was made.
Wasn't I allowed to wipe away the tears of those close to me?
Why did I even have hands in the first place?
One after another, her tears hit the floor.
Perhaps they were tears of sadness.
A sadness she had probably never shown anyone.
Still, I couldn't stop them and I couldn't even wipe them away.
So then, why was I there?
But now that I was there, what could I do for Shiona?
I couldn't find the answers to those questions.
I couldn't move my mechanical hand anymore...
An instant later, a metallic grinding noise echoed around me.
The noise pulsed and reverberated, assaulting my ears.
But then I noticed my extended fingers.
They had broken off and were falling toward the floor.
It started with my fingers, and then moved to my palm... My wrist... Arm... And then shoulders.
The parts that made up my body were breaking apart.
Eventually, I couldn't even stand anymore. My legs gave out.
My legs and torso turned to scrap.
A heap of rusted iron built up.
I couldn't even raise my voice in protest. I had to accept my fate.
She was crying quietly.
The most painful part was that I couldn't even do a thing but look on.
I couldn't even extend my mechanical hand.
I didn't have arms or fingers anymore.
My body kept falling apart. Eventually, the decay reached my head.
I couldn't feel any pain.
There was no way I could.
Even though my chest was gone, a pain still lingered there.
It wasn't pain because my body was falling apart.
The last thing I saw before my vision became blurred was Shiona's sorrowful visage and tears.
In the end, I was just...
a pile of scrap metal.
Suddenly, I woke up.
Was I screaming? I don't remember.
My breathing was erratic.
I hurriedly inspected my surroundings.
It was a dark, dusty space.
The air was damp, warm, and sticky.
Then I noticed the bookshelves filled with thick books.
