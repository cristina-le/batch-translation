This feeling... Why was it necessary for life?
It was bitter... Harsh... Heavy... Painful... Cold...
I could also see Shiona's expression in the mirror.
However, it was also a fragile and slightly sad smile.
It was a smile meant to be reassuring.
Despite that, there was a sharp pain deep within my chest.
"You should be concerned about Tipi. But I want you to think about yourself, first."
"I... I should think about myself?"
"That's right. You need to value yourself."
"I need to value myself... I've never thought about it like that."
"You're very kind, Rei. And that's why you always put other people before yourself."
"But that's what I want to do."
"I think that's a little sad. I don't want you to overdo it, Rei."
"I'm not overdoing anything."
"Really? I don't agree."
Shiona hooked her arm into mine.
"...I'm worried about you."
I felt my heart rate begin to rise.
I had no idea why that was happening.
But it was definitely related to a change in my emotions.
I felt a tenderness in the warmth.
No, more than tenderness... It was an entirely different kind of warmth than anything I could sense with my skin.
"Hey Rei, you want some tea?"
"...Tea? Why?"
"If you drink something warm and powapowa, your soul also becomes powapowa. It feels great to relax both your body and soul."
"But Tipi..."
"Well, Tipi is definitely upset by this death. But she'll absolutely get over it. I think we need to let her be to help that happen. It's important to spend some time alone, you know?"
"You think so?"
"Yes, I really do. Without that, you can't grow stronger."
"Well, people get stronger by overcoming obstacles and sadness. But if someone else helps you every time, you can't grow. So today, don't you think you should leave Tipi alone so she can grow?"
Tipi was weak.
She was always crying.
So, if this was a chance for her to grow stronger...
I should take that opportunity.
"Shiona, could you pour me some tea?"
"Of course. Could you take a seat and wait a bit?"
I sat on the sofa and waited for Shiona to bring the tea.
As I was waiting, a pleasant smell began to fill the room.
"Here you go. It's a special, gentle tea. Go ahead."
The teacup she brought out was filled with an orange liquid.
A subtly sour and slightly sweet aroma floated up to my nose.
"You know, it's been a while since we've been able to just sit down and talk."
"Yeah, you're right. So much has happened..."
"How are your memories, Rei?"
"It still doesn't feel like they're coming back."
"I see... But, there's no reason to hurry. You might just remember things as life happens."
"You're right. Thank you... But, I'm sorry."
"Sorry? For what?"
"You've been letting me live here, and I just feel like there's nothing I can do to repay that kindness."
"You don't need to worry about that. I'm just happy to have you here with me, Rei."
"But that's not any kind of repayment at all."
"Well, that's not all. You fixed the music box... That helped me to be able to sing."
"Couldn't you already sing before?"
"But there's a difference between having a melody and not having one. Look, we performed together at the plaza, right? The truth is, I've sung there many times."
"You've sung there... alone?"
"Yes. But that time, no one listened to me."
"Even with your amazing voice? That's so strange."
"Hehe, thank you. But it's the truth. That's why I was so happy when you brought the music box and came with me."
"I... All I did was play the music box."
"And that made me happy. Having you next to me made me happier than anything else could."
"I feel the same. I'm really happy to be with you, Shiona."
"...Hehe. Thanks. Rei, you've become able to feel so many emotions."
"Emotions? Me?"
"Yeah. You have so many more expressions now than when we first met."
That was what I had wanted and sought after.
It was what I had been craving since the moment I first woke up.
I was overjoyed to hear that from Shiona.
While I was incomplete, Shiona was telling me that I was growing closer to human... Closer to her.
"That's because you've always been next to me, smiling."
"Really? I haven't done anything."
"No, it really is thanks to you. Thank you so much, Shiona."
"I'm the one who should be saying that. Thank you, Rei."
"I should be saying thank you."
"No, I should... Haha, this is funny. All we're doing is thanking each other."
"You're right. What are we doing?"
"...But, it's funny."
"What's funny?"
"I just thought that going on like this forever would be nice... Isn't that funny?"
"No, not at all. I was thinking the same thing..."
"...Do you mind if I move closer?"
Shiona sat next to me.
Close enough for me to feel her warmth.
It was the closest we had ever been to each other.
"Huh...? What is this...?"
"What's wrong?"
"My body feels a bit strange. My chest is... pounding."
Could it be that I was broken? A malfunction serious enough to warrant maintenance would have been troublesome.
"It's okay. I feel the same. My chest has been pounding constantly."
"Huh? Are you okay? Doesn't it hurt?"
"No. This is a really wonderful thing."
With a gentle bashfulness, Shiona placed her hand upon mine.
Softly enfolding the top of my hand.
I rotated my wrist in response. With our hands flat against each others', we intertwined our fingers.
The feeling of her warmth began to intensify.
That warmth traveled within me, deep within my chest.
"There's this warmth seeping into my chest..."
"Your chest...? You mean here?"
She reached out a hand to my chest.
Where she touched became instantly warm.
"Your hand is so warm, Shiona... I wonder why. Are you sick?"
"No, that's not it at all."
"Do you know the reason why?"
"Yeah, I think I do."
"Tell me."
"Haha, what should I say?"
"Don't tease. Wouldn't you be worried?"
"No... Because, well, this isn't just you."
"The warming isn't?"
"Right. My chest also feels really warm right now."
"You too?"
"Yes, me too. In fact, it's probably hitting me even harder than you, Rei."
"That's terrible! How can we fix it?"
"No, no. You can't fix it... And I wouldn't want to."
"That warmth deep inside, that squeezing feeling, it's painful, it's sad, but it's warm... And that's fine. It's completely fine, Rei."
Shiona's hand became slightly warmer atop mine.
I squeezed her hand in return.
"Rei, I have something to ask."
"I want to be with you always."
"Yes. Forever and ever. Can you do that?"
"Yes... I promise."
"Thank you, Rei. That makes me happy... So, so happy..."
Shiona rested her head upon my chest.
At that moment, I felt like my heart was filling up to bursting.
It was similar to the joy I had experienced before, but it was a much stronger feeling.
I wondered what humans called this.
I wanted to ask her, but I felt that doing so would completely destroy the current atmosphere.
So I stayed like that... I let myself stay like this with Shiona.
There was sweet-smelling tea prepared and set on the table. We stayed like that until all the steam had disappeared.
The next day, I was preparing to go out after eating breakfast.
Shiona called out to me as she was washing the dishes.
"I thought I'd go to the library."
"The library... So you're going to go see Tipi?"
"That's my plan."
"I'm sure Tipi is still trying to get over what happened. So shouldn't you just let her be?"
"Maybe... but I can't just leave her be when I think about how she might not be able to get over it alone, and how lonely she might be."
Yesterday, Shiona was by my side, giving me that warm feeling and supporting me just by being there.
"It's okay. Tipi isn't that weak, you know."
"I wonder..."
"I'm sure she's not. Actually, Rei, there's something I want to ask you. Could we go to the plaza today?"
"The plaza? Why?"
"You bring the music box... I'd like to sing again."
"Something depressing happened, right? So it's important for us to rest our feelings, too."
"Rest our feelings...?"
"And because of the funeral, I'm sure that everyone in town is feeling low as well. So, don't you feel like you want to raise everyone's spirits?"
"Everyone in town? Well, sure. Of course I do."
Looking at sad faces was painful.
I wanted to help cure those sad faces if I could.
"And our melody can do that. I just know it will make the town feel better."
"Really... Well, maybe it can."
"I'm sure it can. Okay, so let's get ready."
Inspired by Shiona, I reached out to pick up the music box.
Since it had been maintained daily, the music box was ready to perform at any time.
We set out for the plaza.
It was a cloudy afternoon.
There was hardly anyone out.
"There's no one here, Shiona."
"It's always like this at this time of day. At least, before you came."
"Before I came...?"
"I told you. Once you began playing the music, everyone started to come listen to my singing. All of the people in town have begun changing a little. They go outside more and interact more. I feel like they've all started to form stronger bonds."
"And this is all... after I came?"
"That's right. Once you came, Rei, everyone in this town started to change. Of course, it's all been for the better."
I was very pleased to hear her say that.
I had been helpful to people.
I couldn't even begin to contain the joy I felt from that.
"You look really happy, Rei."
"You do. Your cheeks have softened up."
"My cheeks?"
"Yeah, look."
Shiona poked a finger into my cheek.
Just like that, I began to feel that familiar warmth deep within my chest.
"My face feels a bit hot."
"Rei, are you blushing? Hahaha."
My face grew even hotter.
It seemed like Shiona was exactly right.
"Okay then, Rei. Shall we start?"
"Yeah, are you ready?"
"Whenever you are."
Shiona slowly closed her eyes.
I wanted to gaze at her beautiful face forever.
But I also felt equally strongly about hearing her sing.
So I began to slowly turn the music box's handle.
As it came out, it carried Shiona's song.
The two sounds merged and began to spread their beauty throughout the area.
Soon, people began to gather.
At first their expressions were dark, but slowly smiles began to return to their faces.
Before I realized it, a circle of grinning faces surrounded us in the plaza.
"Her voice is so beautiful."
"Yeah, I'm glad she came today."
"Thank you. Your voice is so very beautiful."
"It's just beautiful..."
"Yes, it really is..."
The smiles and words of the townspeople began to fill the plaza.
Ah, this was it.
This was what I had been seeking.
The smiles of people enjoying themselves.
Seeing those smiles amplified my own joy.
I was sad when I noticed there was one particular girl missing from the crowd.
The blue girl in the library.
The girl who never visited this place.
The girl who always stayed shut up in the library.
All I could do was think about that girl.
Shiona's voice brought me back to reality.
"Sorry, I've just got something on my mind."
"Oh... Well, everyone has gone home."
Looking around, I noticed the ring of people had broken down to a scant remaining few.
Apparently, I had been lost in thought for a long time.
"What were you thinking about?"
"Um... Nothing... It was nothing."
"Let me guess. You were thinking about Tipi, right?"
She read my mind with ease. So I just nodded meekly.
"Yeah... you're right."
"Just like I thought... It's eating at you?"
"Yeah, it is. Because she's still so young."
"Young... Yeah, you're right."
"And she's always alone. There's no way she isn't lonely."
"But it's always been like that for her. She's used to it."
"I don't think so."
"You said it yourself, Shiona. How everyone changed since I came to town."
"Yeah, that's right..."
"So I want Tipi to change, too. She can't spend all of her time feeling lonely."
I began to repeat back to Shiona all she had taught me.
My words began to dim her smile a touch.
She looked toward the library and pursed her lips for a second, then turned back to me with a smile.
"Should we get back, Rei?"
"It's going to rain this afternoon. So let's go back... Okay? I'll make some of that fluffy white soup."
Shiona tugged on my hand, almost pulling me out of the plaza.
A few hours later...
As I was preparing to leave the house, Shiona called out to stop me again.
"Um, I was just in the mood to read a book..."
"If it's a book you want, we have several my brother was reading."
"Well... I'm looking for a type of book I'm sure we don't have here."
"What kind of book are you looking for?"
"One on machinery. I got interested in it after fixing that projector for Madd."
"I see. I'm glad to hear that you've developed an interest in something."
"Thank you. So that's why I'm going to the library."
"Does it have to be today?"
"Yeah, I'd like to go as soon as possible. I want to start reading as soon as I can."
"But it's going to start raining."
"The weather doesn't matter. I'll still go if it rains."
"But won't your book get wet then?"
"It's fine. I'll take a bag."
"Well... Then I'll go get it for you."
"Huh? No, no, no. I'll go myself."
"No, it's okay. I need to do some shopping, so it's no problem for me to stop at the library."
Saying that, Shiona returned to her room.
Why was this happening?
It felt like Shiona was trying to keep me away from the library.
Wait, no.
She was trying to keep me away from Tipi.
I didn't know what it could mean, but it really seemed that Shiona wanted to keep me away from Tipi.
Shiona's words were kind, yet I still got that feeling.
But why would she be doing that?
"I'm ready to go, Rei. What book should I get for you?"
"It's hard for me to explain, so I'll just go with you."
"That's okay. You just stay here and relax."
"Okay then... I want a book about electronic circuits."
"Electronic circuits. Got it. Okay, I'll be back later."
Shiona left.
I waited a few minutes.
Eventually, when I could no longer see her,
I put my hand on the door leading outside.
...Something was strange.
It wasn't locked.
But the door absolutely would not open.
It was like it had been barred from the outside.
...That actually might have been the case.
When Shiona left, she locked the door from the outside, with a key that only worked from the outside. So that I wouldn't notice.
And that's why I couldn't leave through that door.
But... Why?
Why would she do that?
Clutching my head, I went back into the living room.
Looking at the table, I noticed a letter I hadn't seen before.
It was a note from Shiona.
Dear Rei,
You're probably surprised that the door is locked.
Do you remember how we talked about nearby towns being attacked?
Well, that's why I'm taking care to lock up when I leave.
Please watch over the house.
I prepared some bread and soup for you.
Just warm them up and enjoy.
Absolutely do not go outside.
I had heard about the human raiders from the young man who had died.
Could those humans be coming closer to this area?
If true, it would be dangerous to go outside.
I understood. Shiona was worried about me.
But if Shiona went outside, that meant she was in danger.
Shouldn't a man like me have gone shopping instead?
I couldn't lie to myself.
It was clearly true that there were human raiders about.
But even so, was there a reason to lock the door from the outside?
Actually, if the door was locked from the outside, it had to be opened from the outside.
Getting into the house would have been easy.
Something was off.
If we were on alert for raiders, we wouldn't have gone to the plaza to sing the day before.
We certainly wouldn't have gathered a lot of people together in the same place.
So then, why?
There was only one thing I could think of.
She had trapped me.
To keep me away from Tipi.
Shiona wouldn't just do this without a reason.
She had a reason.
And that reason would have to have been for my benefit.
Could it be that something had happened to Tipi?
Was she trying to keep that from me?
Something that wouldn't be good for me to hear... Something I would be sad to learn about...
I couldn't sit still.
I had to see Tipi. I had to make sure she was okay.
The blue girl, crying alone in the library.
I wanted to wipe away her tears.
I looked around the church.
There was a window high up above.
Even if I did get up there and get outside, I had no way of knowing I'd get down safely.
But it was the only way for me to get out of there.
Suddenly, some white cloth caught my eye.
A curtain fluttering in the wind.
There were a number of them in the room. They were big and long, to cover the huge windows, and they looked strong.
I undid all of the curtains.
The sky was enclosed in dark clouds, and not a single ray of light shone through.
I laid the five curtains on the table and began tying them together, ending up with one long piece of cloth.
It was long enough to get me to the ground from one story up.
I tied the curtain to the edge of the window.
I wrapped it around several times, and checked it again and again.
It seemed good.
It could probably support my weight.
I tied the other end of the curtain to myself.
I gritted my teeth and went out through the window.
Looking down, the ground seemed so far away.
I began to feel a little faint, but it was too late to back out.
Clasping to the curtain, I began to slowly lower myself down.
Midway, a strong gust of wind shook me.
Swinging like a pendulum, I held onto the curtain for dear life.
It was minutes until the wind had passed.
I took a deep breath and continued lowering myself.
About ten minutes had passed by the time my feet finally touched the ground.
I was so exhausted that I felt that my legs were about to collapse under me.
But I had no time to rest.
My legs started to carry me towards the library with the young blue girl.
Rain began to fall almost as if it was trying to interfere with my thoughts.
The rain steadily intensified, seemingly in an effort to quench the parched town's thirst.
With no umbrella, I just continued on without minding the rain that soaked me.
My soggy clothes began to stick to my skin, making me feel uncomfortable.
I forged ahead, taking pains to protect my gloved right hand from the rain.
Soon, puddles were forming at my feet, and I started to hear thunder off in the distance.
Occasionally my heavy breaths would bring in rainwater along with the air.
Even as I grew hot inside from the effort, the cold rain pounded against me.
Then I finally arrived, still spitting out rusty rainwater.
I was at the library where the young, blue girl would be waiting by herself.
The inside was dim. No light escaped from the building.
Was she still buried alone in that dark sea of books?
Just the thought created a sharp pain deep inside my chest.
I went inside and headed to where the young, blue girl would be waiting.
"So you came..."
A voice called out from within the library.
But it wasn't Tipi.
It was the very person who was trying to keep me away from here.
"Didn't I write you a letter explaining just how dangerous it was to go outside? Didn't you see it?"
"I saw it."
"You did? So you came knowingly. You're a bad boy, Rei."
I could hear Shiona laughing.
But I couldn't see her expression in the dim room.
"Why did you lock me in?"
"I locked you in? Well, I suppose I did end up doing that. I'm sorry."
"You must have had some reason, right? Won't you please tell me?"
"My reason? The reason was simple. I don't want you two meeting up."
"You don't want us two meeting up?"
"You and the young, blue girl who's here."
"Tipi? Why?"
"I can't tell you that. It's top secret."
"Hold on. What are you even talking about? Why can't I see Tipi?"
"Because... You just can't."
"That's not a reason! Tell me now."
"I can't tell you."
I was suddenly shouting.
At the same moment I noticed a burning hot, red sensation within my chest.
So this was "anger."
I was feeling anger towards Shiona...?
I had no intention of doing that. I just wanted her to tell me the truth.
But it seemed like my words earlier had upset Shiona.
I couldn't see her face in the dark, but I could tell that she had changed.
It felt as if she was hesitating to say something.
Shiona opened her mouth slightly as if to speak... But then closed it, just as I had expected.
Tilting her head down, she began to speak in a whisper.
"It's because... It can only bring unhappiness."
"Unhappiness? To whom?"
"To you, to me... To everyone in town, I think."
"Everyone in town? Because I meet with Tipi? I have no idea what you're saying."
"Well, of course you wouldn't understand now. But you'll definitely regret it."
"Why would I regret it? Shiona, please, explain this to me. I'm not very smart, so it's hard for me to understand. If you don't put it clearly..."
"It's simple..."
I heard the sound of boots.
Shiona came closer to me in the dimly-lit entrance.
The next instant, I felt warmth.
And softness.
Shiona was holding me.
"Shiona... Huh? Wha-what..."
"Please, Rei... Can't we just go home together like this?"
"Like this...? What are you saying?"
"It's bad for you and Tipi to meet. To be precise, if you two meet, a chain reaction of bad things will happen. So..."
"Did I somehow make Tipi mad? And she doesn't want to meet me? Is that it?"
"No, quite the opposite. Tipi likes you a lot."
"Well, then..."
"So that's why you can't meet. Please understand what I'm asking of you."
I could feel the pressure of Shiona's arms wrapped around my waist.
A sweet smell enveloped my body and my head began to spin.
"That's what you want?"
"Yes. From the bottom of my heart."
"How would you feel if I met with Tipi?"
"Really, really sad. Blue and very uncomfortable."
"Why? Why do you feel that way?"
Shiona tilted her head back and looked at me with upturned eyes.
Then she said, unflinchingly,
"Because, Rei... I love you."
"You... love...?"
All of my thoughts almost ground to a halt on hearing that word.
There was a soft sigh.
Our lips were about to touch.
Her arms wrapped around my waist.
There was the warmth of contact.
We were as close to each other as possible.
And then, there was that word.
It was just four letters strung together, but it carried such a deep feeling.
That simple word filled me with an intense energy.
I felt more joy than ever before.
I was needed by someone. There was someone who was emotionally invested in me.
I couldn't even imagine a greater level of joy.
But right then, all of that joy was within reach.
I put my weakened arms around Shiona's waist.
Shiona was receptive.
The warmth inside me strengthened.
"Shiona... I..."
"Yes, Rei. I know. So, let's go back. Let's go home..."
I held on to Shiona's hand.
Then turned around and began to head out of the library.
"Thank you, Rei. But this is how it should be. This is all for you, Rei."
With those words, an uncomfortable feeling began to consume me.
Seemingly confused, Shiona spoke after I stopped suddenly.
"Shiona, what you just said about this being 'for me'..."
"Right, that's what I said."
"That's not true, Shiona."
"Not true? What are you talking about, Rei?"
"You said you're doing this for me, but you're not."
"Of course I am, Rei. All of this is for you."
"No. Because when I'm useful to someone, I feel happy. I'm here to be useful to people. But right now, I'm disappearing from the life of someone who I could help. That doesn't make me happy. That isn't for me. So, who are you doing this for?"
"Shiona, I'm going to go see Tipi. This isn't for anyone else. It's for myself. If this brings unhappiness to anyone, well, then that's my fault. But even if that does happen, I won't stop moving. Because this is what I want."
I let go of Shiona's hand and headed back through the library entrance.
I didn't hear any sounds from Shiona behind me.
All Shiona did was stand silently and look at me with sadness on her face.
Leaving the entrance and its rainy scent, I headed further into the library.
With every step I took, the library's carpet soaked up the moisture from the soles of my shoes.
The dry library air clung to my damp skin.
I just continued to feel terrible.
It might have been from how I had left Shiona.
I felt a pain deep within my chest, as if I had swallowed something heavy.
Time and time again I thought of Shiona.
Every time, I saw her sad smile.
Why did this happen?
Why did I do what I did?
Waves of regret began to wash over me.
But my legs did not stop.
The girl was deep inside the library.
The young girl who was always alone.
The young girl who was always blue.
The young girl who was always crying.
I couldn't leave her alone.
That was why I was walking down that hall.
There were drawings affixed to the hallway's walls.
The drawings were done by Tipi. One a day.
On the newest piece of paper was a drawing of a lone girl.
I knew immediately who the girl was.
A small girl, minuscule on the huge paper.
There were tears on her cheeks.
All of the recent drawings were the same.
A picture of a young girl. Crying and alone.
Just looking at them brought an intense pain to my chest.
The young girl was always alone.
I understood that sadness.
I wanted to wipe away that sadness, soon.
I wanted to teach her that she was not alone.
I wanted to tell her that I was there for her.
I walked down the long hallway, scuffing the soles of my wet shoes on the floor.
I continued walking, staring at the drawings which had been placed as high as Tipi could put them.
At that moment, I suddenly had an uncomfortable feeling.
It wasn't from the drawings.
The problem was the number of drawings.
No matter how you looked at Tipi, she was a young girl.
If she was drawing a picture every day, could she really have drawn all of these?
...Maybe she had been drawing several a day.
Even then, the number of drawings seemed impossible.
Has she really been alone for this long?
Was she doing anything besides drawing pictures?
Oh, why had I left this young girl alone?
How many tears had been shed just from that?
The girl in the drawings cried more tears with each passing day.
It showed her sadness was deepening.
I hurried along.
To the lone girl who was crying deep within the library.
To mend her sadness.
To wipe away her tears.
That young girl. I wanted to hold her in my own two arms.
I was moving so fast that I began to breathe heavily as I continued to work my way to the deepest of the library.
