──The air shifted.
The pale blue light that had been enveloping me receded.
What I saw next was a grimy ceiling.
My right arm, which I extended towards it, was slightly different from my left arm, which I also extended.
My right arm was made of exposed mechanical parts from the wrist down.
My fingers moved smoothly, but each time, a faint scraping sound of metal echoed.
Next, I slowly raised my upper body.
I then realized that the pale blue light I had seen until just now was actually an oval-shaped lid with a gentle curve.
It seems I was asleep inside this capsule-like thing.
Where is this place?
Who am I?
Why am I here?
Even when I asked myself these questions, I couldn't find the answers.
Even when I tried to trace back my memories, all I had was the memory of the pale blue light.
In order to find a clue to my memories, I decided to get out of the capsule and wander around the room.
Although I knew the act of walking, perhaps it had been a long time since I had done it, as my footing was unsteady.
I paid attention not to fall over, and slowly moved forward.
The drifting air was lukewarm, and each time I took air into my lungs, dust clung to my throat.
Light streamed in from a hole in the ceiling, revealing dust particles in the air along its path.
Perhaps no one has entered this building for quite some time.
A thin layer of dust spread across the floor.
What kind of place is this?
Countless oval capsules were scattered throughout the large room.
Most of them were open.
The insides were empty.
Even if some were closed, there was nothing inside.
It seems that I am the only one in this room.
…No, that’s not quite accurate.
There are people who exist, leaning against the oval objects or lying on the floor.
But, that's wrong.
Those aren't exactly people, if I'm being precise.
It would be more accurate to call them humanoid objects.
Those humanoid objects had mechanical parts peeking out from under their skin.
Some had mechanical parts from the neck up.
Some had exposed mechanical arms.
Some had their lower bodies torn off, revealing mechanical parts.
And then, I remembered what those humanoid objects were.
Partners for humans, created for humans.
Equipped with not only the five senses but also emotions, they are the closest existence to humans.
I reach out to a Philoid that has ceased functioning.
The exposed hand, not covered in skin, closely resembled my right hand.
This is a factory.
I was made here.
…It seems the facility was abandoned for some reason just before completion.
I stare at my mechanical right hand, before it was covered with artificial skin, and conclude the most likely possibility.
Having understood my own existence, I started walking towards the wall.
There was an old automatic door there, and right next to it, a liquid crystal panel displaying 《CLOSE》 was covered in dust.
I touched it with my mechanical hand.
The moment I felt something cold like electricity at my bloodless fingertips, it displayed 《OPEN》 and the door opened.
Can I get outside from here?
Is there anyone else left in this facility?
I wanted to meet someone.
I wanted to meet a human.
Let's go find them, my partner.
I pushed open the door leading outside.
In order to prove my own existence.
When I returned home, I headed straight for the living room.
There, I found the broken music box.
I opened the book I borrowed from the library and studied its structure.
Just as I thought, the gears inside were chipped.
That's why no matter how much I turn the handle, the disc won't spin and no sound comes out.
...But, what should I do about this gear?
Would it be possible to make it according to the size written in the book? No, it's impossible.
With no answer in sight, I turned the page of the book.
At the end of the book, there was a list of products for each manufacturer, and a list of parts used.
As I skimmed through it, my gaze caught on something.
What I understood there was that the manufacturer of this music box also made clocks.
If that's the case, the precise parts might be the same as those used in clocks.
Suddenly, I remembered what I broke at Mad's shop.
That clock... if they're going to throw it away because it's unusable...
If I use the gears and other parts from the clock, I might be able to fix the music box.
"Rei, what are you doing?"
At the same time as I saw the possibility of repair, Shiona came into the living room.
"Shiona, listen. I might be able to fix the music box with the parts from the clock that was at Mad's shop."
"Really? Really?"
Shiona was smiling more happily than usual.
From that expression, I could understand Shiona's joy.
"But, don't push yourself too hard. Even without the music box, we can still sing."
Shiona picked up the music box and started singing.
That song, the one she sang in the chapel.
That song, a little nostalgic.
That song, that warms the depths of my heart.
Looking at Shiona, who gazes lovingly at the music box, my resolve grows stronger.
I want to fix this music box for her.
And, I want Shiona to be happy.
That feeling swells up inside me.
"I'm going to Mad's shop again tomorrow."
I'll try to ask him to give me the clock somehow.
But there was one thing I was worried about.
That is, that I broke that clock.
I apologized, but it's still hard to go there.
I'm terrified of Mad yelling at me again.
"You know, I want to make a lot of people smile with this song, Onii-chan."
Shiona's words reached me as I hesitated.
"This song is orange... I'm sure it can turn many people's hearts orange. Because it's a song made with the wish that it would. Because that's Onii-chan's wish. So, I want many people to hear this song. And I want to make many people smile. That's my wish."
Shiona said, as if to herself.
Those words push me forward.
I'll go to Mad's shop again tomorrow.
And I'll apologize again for breaking the clock.
With Shiona's singing and the music box, I strengthened my resolve.
The next day, I visited Mad's shop alone.
I can't count how many times I thought about turning back along the way.
Every time I thought that, Shiona's smile would flash through my mind.
I want to keep seeing that smile.
To do that, I want to fix the music box for her.
I recalled my resolve from yesterday, over and over.
What I can do for Shiona.
I steeled myself and stepped into Mad's shop.
"You, what face do you have to show here?"
Immediately after, Mad's voice, low like distant thunder, rained down.
I immediately wanted to run away, but I didn't.
"I wanted to apologize more sincerely for yesterday."
"About the clock? You already apologized for that."
"Shiona was there at the time... I thought I should apologize properly, by myself."
"I don't need that. Get out of here."
"I can't do that. I'm truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday."
"No matter how much you apologize, the clock is still broken, leave."
"I'm sorry. I'm really sorry."
With my head bowed, I continued to apologize.
I wonder how much time had passed.
Eventually, Mad's voice, a little softer, reached me.
"...Raise your head."
Doing as I was told, Mad's face, looking somewhat exasperated, was there.
"Jeez... what a guy. You're persistent beyond belief."
"I'm sorry..."
"Don't apologize anymore, or I'll punch you!"
He said that, but there didn't seem to be as much anger as yesterday.
I thought I heard a small sigh.
"You're done here, right? Get out of here."
"Um... there's just one thing I wanted to ask."
"A request? You've got some nerve asking me for a favor."
My legs trembled from the pressure, but Shiona's words pushed me forward.
"That clock... could you let me have it?"
"...Say that again."
"Um... that clock from yesterday, could you let me have it--"
"ARE YOU KIDDING MEEEEEEEEEE?!"
The impact was like being struck by lightning, and I froze, standing perfectly still.
"You broke it yourself and now you want me to give it to you? Don't get carried away!"
It's no use... .
I can't take any more than this... .
As I tried to run away, a voice called out from behind.
"Please wait, Mad. Rei just wants to fix my brother's music box."
Shiona, who should have been waiting at home, was there.
Shiona, without being intimidated by Mad, stepped between him and me.
"My brother's music box is broken, and Rei said he'd fix it for me. He just needs the parts for that. He's truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday. So, won't you please forgive him?"
Shiona told Mad with an unwavering smile.
"Hmm... hmmm..."
Mad's face was bright red, but his expression gradually softened.
"But, that clock is gone now. I threw that thing away. However..."
Mad turned his back to us, but continued to move his mouth.
"I threw it away at the abandoned factory on the outskirts of town. I don't know what happened after that."
After saying only that, Mad sat down facing the wall.
"Mad, thank you very much."
Shiona bowed without losing her smile and left the store.
"Ah, thank you very much..."
I bowed in the same way and left the store.
"The abandoned factory is very close to where Rei collapsed."
As soon as we left the store, Shiona told me.
"Um, so Shiona goes to throw away trash there?"
"That's right. Trash from various places gathers there."
"Could it be that you fix things you pick up there and sell them here?"
"That's right. Mad often goes to that place."
I see, that's why there were so many old things in the store.
He probably brings usable things from that place and reuses them.
In any case, I decided to head to that abandoned factory.
"Shiona, if it's okay with you, I'd like you to guide me to that place."
"I'm sorry, the Red Children are coming to my house today."
She must be talking about those kids who were talking to Shiona yesterday.
Come to think of it, I promised to treat them to soup.
"But Rei, you can't go alone, right? I'll go and cancel my promise with the children."
"No, it's okay, Shiona. You should keep your promise."
"But, how are you going to get there?"
"I'll try going to the library. I want to know more about this area, and I want to look at a map."
"The library..."
Shiona's expression seemed to cloud over a little.
"Eh... no, it's nothing... Hey, Rei. Is Tippy-chan fond of you?"
"I wonder. I don't think she hates me, but why do you ask?"
"No, it's nothing. If it's the library, I'm sure there's a map. Goodbye."
"Yeah, I'll do that. Well then, see you later."
I turned on my heel and tried to head to the library.
The smile I saw on Shiona's face at that moment seemed to hold some sadness.
But, I don't know the reason why.
"Rei, you came."
Tippy was in the same place as yesterday, shedding tears in the same way.
"Yeah, I came. Hey Tippy, can I ask you something?"
"Does this library have a map of the town?"
"Yeah, it does. It has lots of them."
"That's good. Will you guide me to where the maps are?"
"I don't mind... but..."
Tippy was somehow hesitant.
"No, that's not it... that's not it, but..."
"Will you... hold me?"
Tippy's face turned a little red.
Her sad expression hasn't changed, but her cheeks seem a little softer.
"...Hold you? You mean, like I did yesterday?"
"Yeah... is it no good?"
"It's not no good. Here, come here."
"Yeah... yeah..."
When I opened my arms, Tippy stood up and jumped into my chest, somewhat hesitantly.
Unlike yesterday, I ended up holding her.
But, my thoughts are the same.
The Tippy I held was still small, soft, and seemed like she would break.
"Tippy, is this okay?"
"Yeah, it's okay. Rei... you're warm."
Tippy nuzzled my chest.
That gesture warmed the depths of my heart.
Could this be the emotion called love?
I want to protect this girl.
I want to stop these tears.
For a while, I held Tippy close.
"Um, can you walk over there like this?"
Tippy pointed her finger towards the aisle from within my chest.
Still holding her, I headed in the direction she indicated.
"Why do you need a map?"
"Apparently, there's an abandoned factory near the town. I want to go there."
"Why, to the abandoned factory?"
"Because, the parts I'm looking for might be there."
"The music box you were looking at yesterday?"
"Yeah, that's right. I really want to fix Shiona's brother's music box for her."
"Shiona's... I see. I hope you find it."
Still held in my arms, Tippy led me without hesitation to the bookshelf where the map books were kept.
"Could it be that you remember where each book is?"
"Yeah, mostly."
"That's amazing... Did someone teach you?"
"Nope. I learned by myself while waiting for Papa and Mama."
When she said the words "Papa and Mama," Tippy's eyes became a little teary.
"Um... is it this one?"
To change the subject, I took out one of the map books.
I sat down on the spot and opened the book.
Like the music box book, this map was also handwritten.
Could it be that all the books in this library are handwritten?
If so, that's a considerable amount.
Just who could have handwritten this many books?
The work would take an endless amount of time, making my head spin.
"It's quite tattered... How old is this book?"
"Um... I don't know. It's a really, really, reeeeally old book."
It seemed like a map from decades ago.
The buildings themselves seem the same as the current townscape, though...
The pages are badly faded, as if tea had been spilled on them.
Some were stuck together and looked like they would tear if I turned them.
I carefully turned the pages.
"Ah, could this be it?"
I found a factory map symbol to the north of the town.
Judging from the direction of Shiona's house, there's a high possibility this is the place.
"Rei... are you going? Don't go..."
Tippy clung to my neck.
I stroked her small back with my hand, over and over.
"It's okay, I'll come back."
"Really? Will you really come back again?"
"Yeah, of course. I promise."
"You promise? You absolutely, absolutely have to come back!"
"Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely for sure."
Again and again, I made promises with Tippy.
I wonder why.
Even so, I hesitated to leave.
A feeling that I wanted to stay by Tippy's side forever welled up inside me.
Hiding that feeling, I left the library.
Entering the abandoned factory I reached with the map, the smell of oxidized oil stung my nose.
This factory must have originally made Philoid arms and legs as well.
All around, unfinished Philoid arm and leg parts were scattered everywhere.
All of them are before being covered with artificial skin, with the machine parts exposed.
Looking closely, I can see that they are made the same way as my right hand.
Even knowing they are artificial, this sight was bizarre.
To move a rolling arm out of the way, I pushed it away with my right hand.
The mournful sound of metal colliding echoed throughout the factory.
If, by some chance, any part of my body breaks down, I'll come here.
Here, there are mountains of replacement parts.
In the back, there were many rolling drums filled with oxidized oil.
Most of it has oxidized, but some of it was unopened.
Even if I run out of oil, I can perform maintenance here without being seen.
The further I went into the factory, the more the worries I had in the back of my mind were resolved.
This abandoned factory should become an important place for me.
But, I can't find the most important thing.
That is, of course, the watch that Mad discarded in this place.
But, inside this factory, there isn't even anything that looks like trash, let alone a watch.
Could it be that the trash was thrown outside, not inside the factory?
I decided to leave the factory for now and go around its perimeter.
Then, on the back side of the factory, I was able to find an area where machine parts were piled high.
There were machine parts, of course, but also a lot of trash thrown away.
Surely this town's garbage dump is here.
Besides Mad, there must be others who have taken things that could be used from here.
Looking up at the mountain that was many times my height, I thought about that.
"...Now then, where could it be?"
There's a considerable amount of trash.
It would be difficult to find it by searching steadily.
But, there's no other way.
I decided to start searching from my feet right away.
I don't know how long it took.
I had long since lost my sense of time.
Because I was moving muddy metal plates and containers covered in waste oil, my hands were filthy.
Oil was stuck to my clothes, and before I knew it, there were a lot of stains.
After that, I crossed a carpet of garbage, swam in a river of filth, and was hit by a waterfall of scrap.
And then, I finally found it.
It was at Mad's shop.
The one I broke yesterday.
That watch.
I picked it up and stared intently at the hands on the dial.
Naturally, it wasn't moving.
I put it to my ear, but it didn't make any sound.
Of course, since I broke it.
This clock will probably never tick again.
That fact pricked the depths of my heart slightly.
Gently, I hugged the clock and decided to start heading home.
Shiona will greet me kindly.
"I'm home. I found it."
When I held out the oil-stained trophy, Shiona smiled gently.
"Really, thank you. Here, change your clothes, change your clothes."
Shiona had prepared a towel and a change of clothes for me.
After wiping off the dirt and changing, I headed to the living room.
Shiona greeted me there as well.
"Ray, you must be tired? Eat and rest."
"No, I'm okay. I want to get to work right away."
"Are you okay? I'm worried about your body, Ray."
"I'm fine. For some reason, I don't feel tired right now."
"But, you have to eat..."
"Yeah, I know. I'll eat later, so you go ahead and eat."
"...Okay, I understand. Good luck."
Shiona leaves the living room.
I watched her go, and then I started working.
I opened the book I borrowed from the library beside me.
This music box has a mechanism inside where gears of various sizes mesh intricately when the handle is turned, keeping the disc rotating at a constant speed.
Apparently, turning it faster doesn't make the song play faster.
I thought that was an amazing technique.
Following the assembly instructions written in the book in reverse order, I disassembled the music box.
Then, as I compared the parts one by one to check if any were missing, I found that a gear in the power transmission section was broken.
Even with something that moves with such precision, it only takes one small part to fail for it to stop working.
I couldn't help but look at my right hand.
For now, I'll try to find a gear of the same size as this broken one from the clock.
I then started disassembling the clock.
I removed the lid and used a screwdriver to remove the screws.
When I removed the cover, the internal structure was revealed.
Gears much more precise than those in the music box meshed together in multiple layers.
One of them, a slightly larger gear, had a broken axle. That's why the parts weren't turning.
I guess this is the place I broke yesterday.
The fact that Mad discarded this clock means that there wasn't a gear of the same size.
Fortunately, the broken gear wasn't the size needed for the music box.
Disassembling things makes me feel somewhat reluctant.
Because I'm breaking this clock to fix the music box.
Perhaps it's because I understand what kind of existence I myself am.
Hesitantly, but as a small offering, I disassembled the clock as carefully as possible.
I lined up the clock gears on the table, starting with the smallest, and compared them to the ones from the music box.
"...Found it."
I was able to find a gear that seemed to be almost the same size.
All that's left is to transplant this into the music box according to the book.
"I think this should work..."
The disc should move without any problems now.
I put the lid back on and turned the handle, and I felt some resistance.
But the handle won't turn any further than that.
I wonder why.
I reread the book.
There are no problems with the parts or the positions they're assembled in.
Tilting my head in confusion, I removed the lid again.
Then, I tried turning the handle as it was.
The gears were indeed meshing perfectly.
But it seems the oil has completely dried up, probably because it hasn't been used for a while.
That must be the reason why the handle won't turn.
What should I do?
Should I go to Shiona and borrow some cooking oil?
...No, that's a problem too.
Cooking oil and gear lubricant are probably different types of oil.
It might work at first, but it could cause a breakdown.
If that's the case, what should I do...?
Suddenly, I looked at my right hand.
Although it's covered by a glove, there are bare mechanical parts underneath.
What about using the oil used in my hand?
I took off my glove and looked closely at my right hand.
Exposed mechanical parts.
Oil is built inside to smoothly move those parts.
I inserted a screwdriver into the palm of my hand near the base of my thumb.
When I removed the exterior, it was packed with mechanisms such as wiring, cylinders, and shafts to move my mechanical hand.
One of the cylinders inside contained oil.
And it was detachable so that the old oil could be easily replaced.
I removed the cylinder with my left hand and dripped the oil that filled it onto the gears of the music box.
I spread the oil with my fingertip so that it would blend into all the gears as much as possible.
I wonder if it will work?
I returned the cylinder to my right hand and reattached the exterior.
Hiding my mechanical arm with a glove, I cautiously turned the handle.
Stiffly at first. But as I turned the handle, the gears ran smoothly.
The oil must have circulated through all the gaps in the gears, and the handle continued to turn without any snagging.
And that melody begins to play.
"Rei, that song...!"
Shiona suddenly came into the room.
"Yeah. It's fixed, Shiona."
"Thank you... thank you, Rei. Thank you... I'm so, so happy."
Shiona showed me a smile I had never seen before.
Just looking at that smile, the depths of my heart warmed up.
And then, I realized.
Ah, so this is it.
This is the emotion called happiness.
I am happy now.
I am happy to see Shiona's smile.
And, for the first time, I was able to feel a sense of accomplishment.
"Thank you, Rei, thank you."
Shiona took my hand and thanked me many times.
As her face drew closer, I felt my face getting hot.
"Thanks to Rei's hard work, the music box is fixed. I can listen to that song again, which I had given up on. This orange-colored song that my brother made. This song that I love so much..."
"Hey, Shiona, sing it. Let me hear your brother's song."
"Yes... of course!"
I turned the handle of the music box.
Shiona clasped her hands in front of her chest and began to sing along with the melody.
The song she was singing when we met.
The song that Shiona's brother made.
An orange-colored song.
Now I feel like I understand its meaning.
The emotion dwelling in my heart is joy.
Shiona's song.
And Shiona, singing so happily.
Just watching her like that, I was overflowing with joy.
More than usual, Shiona seemed so happy as she sang that song.
That day, Shiona kept singing until she fell asleep.
I was also absorbed in her singing voice and the timbre of the music.
Over and over, Shiona asked me to play the song.
Until my arm could no longer move, Shiona kept singing.
Looking at that expression, I think.
I want to be with Shiona like this forever.
If Shiona wishes for it, I can be with her forever.
But for that to happen, my true identity must never be revealed.
Never, absolutely never...
That day, I solidified my resolve to stay with Shiona forever.
Night, the room darkened.
On the two beds placed side by side, Shiona speaks to me.
"Will you listen to my request?"
"You see, I want many people to hear this song. And I want to make them smile. I want to make many people happy with this song that my brother made."
I only know the words.
But I didn't know what it was.
Is it a state of being?
Or is it an emotion?
I repeated the word 'happiness' over and over in my head.
"So, I want you to help me."
"Help? What should I do?"
"Tomorrow, I want you to go to the plaza with me. And I want you to play the music box."
"And then, Shiona will sing, right?"
"Yes, that's right. And I want as many people as possible to hear it. The orange-colored song that my brother made..."
"Yeah, I want to do that too. Of course, I'll help."
I heard the sound of the sheets rubbing together.
"What's wrong, Shiona?"
"Hey, Rei... can I hold your hand?"
I can't see Shiona's expression in the darkness.
But I felt like Shiona's face was turning red.
"Hand? With me?"
"Yeah, I want to hold yours, Rei... Is that... no good...?"
I search through my knowledge.
I know the act of holding hands.
But what it means for a boy and girl of a certain age...
"N-no, it's okay..."
If I'm needed by a human... by Shiona, then I want to respond.
Fortunately, she's on my left side.
If it's the hand covered in artificial skin, I don't think there'll be a problem.
I reach my hand out to the bed next to me.
In the cold room, my outstretched hand was a little chilly.
I search for Shiona's hand in the air.
Touching, warmth.
Shiona's hand overlapped with mine.
"You're warm, Rei."
"Yeah... you're warm, Shiona."
We held hands.
Without either of us saying anything, we intertwined our fingers.
It wasn't just the warmth coming from our hands, a different kind of warmth was spreading.
Is this the warmth of a human, different from my artificial warmth...?
"Rei... tighter, please."
"...Like this...?"
"Sorry, was that too tight?"
"No... it was just stronger than I expected."
"Is this strength okay?"
"Yeah... thank you, Rei."
We held hands all night long.
Until the morning woke us, our hands remained clasped.
The next day, the plaza was overflowing with sound.
The melody that Shiona and I began to play.
Shiona sang.
I turned Shiona's older brother's music box.
At first, there was no one passing by.
But as if drawn in by Shiona's singing voice, the number of people increased.
One, two people stopped, and soon a small circle formed.
That circle quickly grew larger, and the deserted plaza quickly became bustling with activity.
Everyone there was listening intently to Shiona's singing voice.
A young couple snuggled close, holding each other's hands.
An old man closed his eyes with deep emotion.
A young man gazed at a woman a little distance away.
A young parent and child laughed happily together.
The children were moving their bodies to the rhythm of the song.
Each of them was listening to Shiona's song with their own thoughts.
But there was one thing they all had in common.
That was that everyone was 'smiling'.
Everyone was smiling as they listened to Shiona's song.
I felt a warmth deep in my heart, feeling that I was helping to bring smiles to the faces of the people in this place.
This is the emotion of happiness.
The emotion I felt yesterday when I saw Shiona's smile.
This is what it was.
I am happy.
I felt my cheeks lift slightly.
I'm sure I'm smiling too.
It might be a slightly awkward-looking smile.
But that's okay.
If I can get even a little closer to Shiona, I'll be satisfied with just that.
The music box, which I had just repaired, continued to play the melody flawlessly.
The turning handle is also in good condition.
The sound flowing from the disc reverberates and amplifies inside the wooden box, becoming a clear tone that goes outside.
According to Shiona, an orange-colored melody.
Shiona sings along to that melody.
I wished this time could last forever and ever.
This time where people can smile.
And I wanted to keep watching Shiona's profile as she sang so happily, forever and ever.
Suddenly, my gaze drifted towards the library on the outskirts of town.
I thought I saw the closed curtains sway slightly.
For a moment, I even saw a small figure.
I know who it is.
That blue-haired girl who's always crying.
It's Tippy.
She's probably still crying right now.
In that lonely library--.
Just thinking about it made my chest ache slightly.
It felt like a thorn had pierced me.
What kind of feelings did Tippy have as she watched this circle?
A circle of smiles that continues to expand.
Everyone there was smiling and sharing the same feelings.
I noticed that there was one person with a scowl on their face.
That person with hunched shoulders and crossed arms is Mad.
He was so out of place, the only one with the emotion of 'anger' on his face.
I suddenly met eyes with Mad, who harbored that emotion I didn't yet know.
It was a time shorter than a second.
Mad harrumphed immediately, turned on his heel, and disappeared into the crowd.
Watching him go, I was thinking.
I want to make everyone smile.
Those two expressing sadness and anger.
I want to make Tippy and Mad smile.
But, what should I do?
While turning the handle of the music box, I kept thinking about such things.
After the song ended, I headed to Mad's shop alone.
I couldn't help but be concerned about that scowl he had at that time.
I cautiously stepped into the shop, which was as dim and eerie as ever.
There weren't any customers.
Only Mad was sitting in the chair at the register.
However, something was strange.
Unlike before, he wasn't leaning back in the chair.
He was just staring intently at what seemed to be a small, rectangular chip in his hand.
His expression was still stern, but there was also a hint of loneliness about him.
"Um... Mad-san?"
When I spoke to him, Mad hurriedly hid the chip in his palm.
"O-oh, what do you want? Why did you come in here without permission?"
"I didn't exactly barge in, it's a shop so anyone can enter, right...?"
"Don't be ridiculous! You're an insolent brat to enter my shop without my permission!!"
I'm being told something very unreasonable.
"But, for Mad-san to not notice me coming in, you must have been really focused on that chip."
"The chip you're hiding in your palm."
"I'm not hiding anything!!"
"But I saw it. If you say you're not hiding it, then open your palm and show me what's inside--"
"Shut up and get out! And don't ever come back again!"
As if pushed out by his words, I was kicked out of Mad-san's shop.
I came here to make Mad-san smile, but I'm doing the exact opposite.
Shiona was waiting for me in front of the shop.
Her smile warmed the depths of my heart a little.
"Huh? Why is Shiona here?"
"I was worried about where Rei was going, so I followed you."
"I came here thinking I'd make Mad-san smile. But, I just made him angry again..."
"Make Mad-san smile...? That's a very difficult thing to do. So don't worry about it. Mad-san getting angry is just a normal thing."
"But, today he seemed angrier than usual."
"More than usual? Did something happen?"
"I don't really know, but I asked him about the chip."
"...Chip?"
"Yeah, it was a rectangular chip, small enough to fit in his palm. Mad-san was staring intently at it..."
I used my fingers to show Shiona the size of the chip Mad-san was holding.
Shiona's eyes widened slightly, as if she knew something about the chip.
"Could it be that you asked him about that chip?"
"That's right. Then, he suddenly got angry--"
"Yes, yes, I see. Rei, it can't be helped."
"Can't be helped? What do you mean?"
"That chip is Mad-san's treasure."
"Mad-san's treasure? What's inside it?"
"It should contain a movie that Mad-san's son made."
"His son's movie? Is Mad-san's son a movie director?"
"Yes, that's right. Although, he left this town a long time ago and hasn't come back since."
Shiona said, while looking towards the shop.
A troubled, yet still smiling... a strange expression with those two emotions mixed together.
"But, why is he just staring at the chip? He could just watch the movie."
"That's impossible. There's no equipment in this town that can play that chip."
"So, Mad-san can't watch it even if he wants to, so he just stares at it like that?"
"I'm sure that's it. He's shy, so he won't say it out loud."
At that moment, I had an idea.
A way to make Mad-san, who always has a scowl and is always angry, smile.
"No, it's nothing. Shiona, I have a place I want to stop by, so go on back first."
"A place you want to stop by...?"
"Yeah, there's something I want to look into."
"...The library?"
I thought I saw Shiona make a slightly surprised expression.
I wonder if she's worried about me, since I'm still not used to the town.
"I promise I won't be late."
I said clearly, trying to ease Shiona's worries.
Shiona opened her mouth as if to say something, but closed it immediately.
And once. She smiled after briefly biting her lip for just a moment.
"...Okay. Be careful, Rei."
I parted ways with Shiona in front of Mad-san's shop and started walking through the town alone.
The inside of the library was as dim as ever, and the air was stagnant.
I headed straight through the maze-like interior without hesitation.
To the blue girl who is always crying--.
"Rei, you came."
Tipi stood up and ran over to me when she saw me.
I gently embraced her small body.
"Yeah, because I promised."
"Thank you, Rei. I'm so happy."
Tipi has her face buried around my stomach.
I could feel her tears flowing through my clothes.
"Tipi, what were you doing?"
"Drawing, come here Rei."
Taking my hand, Tipi leads me as we walk.
Where Tipi was sitting, there was drawing paper and crayons scattered around.
Inside that drawing paper, there's a picture that's being drawn.
"Did you draw this, Tipi?"
"Yeah. I draw one every day."
Tipi said that, and then resumed drawing.
I peek into the picture.
There, a picture of a singing girl and a boy turning a music box is drawn.
"Tipi, could this be..."
"It's Rei and Shiona. Singing in the plaza."
So Tipi was watching us through the curtains after all.
When I imagine Tipi watching us all alone, for some reason, the depths of my heart ache.
"Rei, what's wrong? Is something hurting somewhere?"
The eyes of the girl looking up at me are filled with sorrow.
As if to comfort that emotion, I placed my hand on Tipi's head.
"It's okay, it's nothing. It's a very good picture."
"Yeah... Thank you, I'm happy."
When I pat her head, Tipi snuggles up to me affectionately.
But that face is fragile, and sad--.
I sincerely wanted to see this child's smile.
"You said you draw one every day, but are there other pictures?"
"Yeah, there are. Rei, come here."
Tipi stood up, took my hand, and led me to the back of the library.
There, the pictures were.
Tipi must have put them up herself, as several pictures were pasted on the wall in a low position.
"This is the picture I drew yesterday, this is the day before that, this is the day before that..."
Tipi explains each one to me.
A picture of a girl holding hands with a young man, looking happy.
A young man and another girl visiting the girl.
And then, a picture of a girl crying alone.
Ah, I see.
This is Tipi's picture diary.
From then on, there were pictures of a girl continuing to cry alone.
Since I came here, Tipi is no longer alone.
The expression on the girl in the picture seemed to have softened a little.
Surely that is Tipi's own emotion.
But it was still something pregnant with sadness.
I wanted to make this girl smile too.
What can I do for that purpose?
I can't think of an answer.
The only thing I can say is to be by Tipi's side like this.
"Hey, Rei, what kind of book did you come to find today?"
Tipi, still with a sad expression, tugged at my sleeve and looked up at me.
"I'm looking for a device that can project images... Is there a book that explains that?"
"Yeah, there is. It's a little far from here, though."
"Will you guide me?"
"Yeah, okay. Here!"
And then Tipi spread out her hands.
The bear plushie in her right hand dangled in the air.
"Carry me."
I picked Tipi up.
Just like before, she rubbed her cheek against my chest.
"It's over there, Rei."
And so, I began to be guided to the book I was looking for.
The book was on the second floor of the library--.
A corner of the shelf where materials on images from all over the world, such as projectors and projection machines, are gathered.
"The book you want to read is definitely here."
The books lined up on the bookshelf were all handwritten, just like the music box books and maps.
However, there seem to be quite a few types of projectors, some using film and some using discs.
"What kind are you looking for?"
"I'm looking for something that can project a chip about this size, do you know?"
I used my fingers to show the size of the chip that Mad had.
"Hmm... a square? Or a square with only one corner missing?"
"The corner was... like it was missing diagonally... I think."
I didn't look at it very closely, so I can't say for sure.
But Tipi nodded slightly.
"That shape, is it Mad's chip?"
"Yeah, it's the chip Mad had."
I was surprised that Tipi knew about Mad, but it wasn't strange at all since he's the owner of the general store in this town.
Shiona knew about Mad's chip too, and maybe everyone in town knows.
And the fact that Mad is stubborn and doesn't try to look inside is probably common knowledge.
"Um, well... if that's the case... then... this."
Tipi stood on her tiptoes and pointed to a book that was in the shelf that she could barely reach.
"That's amazing, Tipi. You really do remember the location of all the books."
"Ehehe. I got praised."
Tipi pressed her face against my stomach.
While patting her head, I picked up the book and checked its contents.
It was more like an instruction manual than a book.
“Mume Company Projector” - The types of playable media and chips are written in detail.
The internal structure and wiring are also carefully written down.
It seems to be a projection-type player that can project the contents recorded on a portable chip onto a screen or white wall.
If I can find this device, I can show Mad the movie inside the chip.
"Thank you, Tipi, I found the information I wanted."
"...Are you leaving already?"
Tipi looked up at me with a sad expression.
"...Yeah, sorry."
"Nooo. Don't go."
Perhaps she intended to stop me from leaving.
Tipi hugged me.
That innocent warmth shook my resolve.
But I have to go.
Because I want to make Mad happy right now.
Because I want to see Mad's smile.
"Tipi, I promise. I'll definitely come again tomorrow."
"Tomorrow...? Really...?"
"Yeah, really. I promise."
"...You won't disappear?"
"Yeah, I won't disappear. I'll come see you every day, without fail."
"...Okay. I'll be waiting."
With lingering reluctance, I left the library, leaving behind the blue-haired girl -- Tipi.
"You're back again! What did you come here for!!!"
As soon as I visited the shop, Mad's angry roar greeted me.
I want to run away.
I want to cover my ears.
But I didn't.
Because I wanted to fulfill Mad's wish.
"Mad, I have a request. Please lend me your son's chip."
"That chip with your son's movie on it."
"Why should I lend it to you? Don't be ridiculous!!"
"Please... please."
"Enough with your meddling! It's a nuisance!"
"I... I want to be helpful to Mad!!"
"Helpful, you say?"
Mad's glare intensified, and fear began to take hold, constricting my throat.
The movable parts of my knees lost their strength, and I felt lightheaded.
I want to run away right now... but I can't hesitate here.
"I heard about that chip from Shiona. That your son left town to become a movie director. And that movie was sent from your son, right? But you couldn't watch it because you didn't have the playback device, am I wrong?"
I spoke rapidly, trying to suppress my fear.
Perhaps taken aback by my momentum, Mad looked at me with a slightly surprised expression.
"I just went to the library. To find out what kind of device is needed to play it."
"You... you went to the library...?"
Mad looked even more surprised at the word 'library'.
"Yes... I'll find a device that can play that chip. If the player is broken, I'll fix it. If I can't find one, I'll even build one by piecing together various parts."
"Why would you go so far? It's none of your business."
"It may be true that it's not my business. But it's what I want to do."
"I want to be helpful to Mad... that's all. So, please."
Silence ensued.
Is this a silence of affirmation, or—.
"That guy was the worst, a complete idiot for a son."
Mad sat down in his chair and looked up at the ceiling.
And with a somewhat sad expression, he began to tell me his story.
All we ever did was fight.
Every time we saw each other, a fight would start.
So, at some point, he started avoiding me.
No, maybe I was the one avoiding him.
Anyway, we stopped seeing each other as much.
So when he came to me and said he had something to talk about, I was surprised.
“I’m leaving this town.”
“Leaving town? What are you talking about?”
“I’m leaving this town to become a movie director. I realized, I really do love movies.”
“Stop talking about dreams and face reality. There’s no way someone like you can be a director. You can’t do it.”
“Don’t just assume it’s impossible! You won’t know unless you try!”
“I know, I’m your father. No one will watch a movie by a director without talent.”
“There are people who recognize me! I’ve produced results! You’re just the only one who won’t acknowledge it!”
“I can’t even dream in a town like this!”
“A town like this? Say that again.”
“I’ll say it as many times as you want. I can’t stand a life spent in a town like this, in a shop like this.”
“You… enough…”
“I’ll say it as many times as I want! You’re just afraid of changing!”
“Ever since Mom died, you’ve been doing the same thing every day--”
Without thinking, I hit him.
“...Always resorting to violence. I’ve had enough.”
“...I see. Get out.”
“Yeah, I will. Just keep doing the same thing here forever.”
My son left home.
And since then, he hasn’t even sent a single message.
The only thing he sent was this movie on a chip.
How am I supposed to watch it when I don’t have a player?
I can’t forgive him for being so selfish.
I don’t want to watch a movie like this.
I especially don’t want to see his face.
I was surprised by Mad-san's uncharacteristic loquacity.
The more I heard his feelings, the more excited I became.
If Mad-san really hated his son, there would be no need to keep a chip that can’t be played.
If his son hated Mad-san, he wouldn’t have sent him the movie he made.
Surely, he wants Mad-san to see this movie.
I think he sent that chip to Mad-san with some kind of feeling.
That’s why I want to show this movie to Mad-san.
I bowed my head again.
“Please! Lend me the chip!”
Mad-san came in front of me in silence.
I was prepared to be yelled at, but I no longer felt fear.
More than that, my desire to be helpful to Mad-san was stronger.
But Mad-san handed me the chip he was holding.
“Do what you want.”
I stared at the chip I received once more.
It was a metal core covered with organic glass, running iridescent electronic circuits.
I knew what it was. A general-purpose chip also used for Phylloid's memory backup.
It had become a world standard, and most manufacturers had adopted this format.
If that's the case, it might be playable even without a Mume Corporation projector.
I clenched the chip and bowed my head towards Mad-san.
A deserted factory on the edge of town.
I had set foot in a pile of garbage behind it.
I thought that if there was a device to play Mad-san's chip, it would be in this abandoned factory.
If it were in the town, he would have played it long ago.
There is a lot of equipment mixed in with the garbage.
Wiring that has been cut off, things that have rusted.
As far as I can see, it's all unusable.
It's unlikely that the projector itself that I'm hoping for is in this place. But I think I can find some parts, like a circuit board.
That's right, as I told Mad-san, I'll connect the parts and assemble them so that the chip can be played.
This is the only place I can rely on.
If I don't do something here, Mad-san will remain with that expression forever.
I won't let that happen.
I don't want that to happen.
With that single-mindedness, I break down the scrap heap.
But no matter how much I search, I can't find the device I'm looking for.
Mad-san must have searched for it before, too.
No... maybe Mad-san is still searching even now.
Shiona said that Mad-san fixes things he picks up at this garbage dump and sells them at the general store.
I wonder if his real purpose was to find a projector to play his son's chip.
If that's the case, I wonder how Mad-san feels, having been unable to find it until now...
Picking up something else instead of a projector... I wonder what he was thinking when he was repairing it...
I broke Mad-san's watch.
Ah... I see... so that's why Mad-san was angry.
That watch was something in the process of trying to get back something important to Mad-san.
This is speculation. But I want to think that's the case.
If so, I won't be able to easily find what Mad-san has been searching for all along.
Even so, I won't give up.
Finding the projector should be the greatest atonement for Mad-san for me, who broke the watch...
It was when I dragged a piece of equipment larger than my body.
I felt something strange in my right hand.
A very slight discomfort... I feel a stiffness in the movement of the joints of my fingers.
Is it out of oil, or has something broken down?
It might not be good to continue working like this.
I couldn't stop moving my hands.
Mad-san must have searched the area within my reach, too.
I look up at the mountain of scrap iron piled much higher than my own height.
If it's me, who weighs less than Mad-san, I might be able to climb it.
Thinking that, I immediately began to clamber up the unkempt, awkward stairs.
I could feel water hitting my back.
Large raindrops were pouring down from the sky I looked up at.
"Rei, let's stop now."
A voice came from a position lower than my feet.
When I turned around, Shiona was there.
She was looking up at me, getting wet in the rain.
"It's raining. You'll catch a cold if you stay like this."
"I'm okay, I'll look a little more, thank you."
"Even if you don't find it, Mad-san will be happy that you tried so hard."
"I'm okay, Shiona. Just a little more."
I continued working.
From behind me, Shiona was talking to me unilaterally.
"But you're already soaking wet. Let's stop. You're tired, right? No one will blame Rei for giving up."
As if to soothe me.
"I'm worried about your body, let's stop, okay? I'll be sad if you get hurt, Rei... Giving up is also important."
"There might be other ways, so let's go home today. I'm preparing orange fluffy soup for you."
"Let's go home... Rei, let's go home... Hey, Rei... I'm worried about you, Rei..."
Even so, I continued.
Undaunted by the pouring rain, I kept searching.
I pulled out a rusted iron plate.
The moment I did, a small avalanche of scrap metal occurred.
I retreated, dodging the scrap metal that came crashing down at my feet with a roar.
"That's dangerous, Rei!"
I turned around at Shiona's voice, and a mountain of scrap metal pouring down from behind jumped into my eyes.
The mountain piled up behind me was also collapsing in the same way.
While being swallowed up, I somehow ran up the collapsing scrap metal.
After a while, the avalanche subsided, and only the sound of rain remained in the area again.
"Are you okay, Rei? Are you hurt?"
"Yeah, somehow... That was close."
"Really... I'm glad you're safe, so glad..."
Shiona let out a sigh of relief.
As if to prove my safety, I stood up.
"Ah... Rei, that."
Shiona pointed at my feet with wide eyes.
The mountain of scrap metal that had collapsed earlier. Among them was a piece of equipment I recognized.
It was the same equipment that was in the book Tipi had shown me.
I dug it out, and when I looked at the surface of the device, it was marked with the faded letters 'Miumu'.
"I found it... Shiona, this is it! I found it!"
I lifted it up high so Shiona could see it.
The water that had accumulated inside flowed out as it tilted.
"I did it, I did it, Shiona! I finally found it! Now Mad will be able to watch the movie!"
"Yeah, but... I think that machine is broken...?"
"Huh?"
When Shiona said that, I brought the hand holding the device in front of my eyes.
Certainly, the device I found—'a projector made by Miumu Corporation'—had obvious signs of damage.
The lens needed for projection was missing.
Also, there was a large crack in the upper part, and when I peeked inside, the internal circuit board was covered in rust.
With this, it's impossible to project a movie.
"That's too bad... Rei, shall we go home now?"
Shiona's hand was offered to me.
I placed my hand on top of that hand.
That warmth warmed my rain-chilled hand.
By the time we returned to town, the rain had stopped.
But the inside of my heart didn't clear up.
Can I really repair the projector that I'm holding in both hands?
In my heart, I was determined to fix it, but now that I've witnessed how tattered it is, that resolve is wavering.
"What's wrong, being so soaking wet like that?"
I was suddenly called out to on the way back to the church.
Standing there when I turned around was the director of the photo studio who had taken my picture before.
I was just looking for something.
Looking for something...? I see. So, did you find what you were looking for?
Yes... but...
Is something the matter?
We found it, but it's broken and unusable.
Shiona answered for me, who was feeling dejected.
I see. That's too bad. By the way, what were you planning to use it for?
Actually... I wanted to play the chip that Mad has.
Mad's? The chip that was sent from his son, right?
...Yes. I wanted to make Mad-san, who is always angry, happy...
Is that something you truly want to do from the bottom of your heart?
The director asked gently, yet as if testing me.
Yes, of course.
I answered without hesitation.
Mad-san... always has an angry face and looks very pained. I think if there's some kind of trigger, he'll smile. I think people can be happy if they can laugh. And I think other people who see that can be happy too.
Having said that much, I look at Shiona.
Shiona taught me that...
Shiona looked surprised at my words, but soon smiled.
Yes, that's the expression. Someone's smile makes the people around them feel happy too.
The moment Shiona smiled at me, my heart warmed up as well.
I see... Could you show it to me?
The director pointed at the projector I was holding. I silently handed over the broken device.
The photo studio director carefully examined the device.
I see, this is terrible. There are too many missing parts to even try to fix it.
Hearing that from the director, who always takes care of his cameras, makes me want to give up.
Perhaps noticing my depressed mood, the director gave a wry smile and returned the projector.
Rei, should we go home soon? You'll catch a cold.
That's right. It's bad for your health to stay wet in the rain. It's best to go home and change first.
Any more than this and we'll be bothering the director too much.
Even if I'm okay, the human Shiona will catch a cold.
Hugging the projector, we bowed to the director and headed towards the church.
When we returned to the church, Shiona wiped my head with a fluffy towel.
Gently, softly, carefully patting without rubbing.
That's too bad about the projector.
...Yeah, but that place was originally a garbage dump, so it's only natural that it was broken.
It's something I should have realized if I had thought about it a little. But I was hoping for a convenient outcome.
That if I wished for it, something would happen. That if I worked hard, the results would surely follow.
I'm reminded that reality isn't that sweet.
It can't be helped. You did your best, Rei, no one will complain.
But... but I wanted to show Mad the movie.
Yeah... Rei, you're so kind.
It's not kindness or anything like that. I just think it's my role.
But just that feeling alone will make Mad happy. That's enough.
I hope so...
For now, let's warm up, okay? I'll make us something that'll warm both our bodies and hearts.
Folding the towel she used to wipe my head, Shiona smiled and headed towards the kitchen.
I sat down on a chair and sighed.
I look at the broken projector on the table.
...No, there's no point in being depressed.
Even though it's broken, we've made some progress compared to having nothing at all.
If I fix this projector little by little, I should be able to play the chip someday.
The book I borrowed from Tipi had instructions on how to disassemble it for maintenance.
If I unravel it in order, I should be able to fix it.
I can look for the missing parts one by one at that factory.
I want to see Mad smile. I want to see a look of joy like Shiona had when the music box was fixed.
I renew my resolve to fix the projector.
Just then, I noticed that the main hall of the church was getting lively.
Excuse me.
When I opened the door and peeked out, I saw the director of the photo studio.
And behind him were even more townspeople.
What's going on?
When I asked in puzzlement, the townspeople offered me something with smiles on their faces.
This is a part from our broken clock. Feel free to use it if you like.
I thought this wiring might fit.
Use my light.
No, use my light.
We have a lot of tools at our place, so use as many as you need.
Various electrical components, wiring equipment, electronic circuits, gears, and screws were placed on the table one after another.
Unable to understand the situation, I was stunned, and the director smiled kindly.
Um... what is this?
You're going to fix that projector, right? When I told everyone about it, they brought things that they thought might be needed. There may be some unnecessary items, but it's better to have materials than not, right?
But why...?
Everyone here was moved by your and Shiona's music and singing. They really wanted to thank you. ...I'm one of those people too.
The director took out a lens and handed it to me.
This... It's a camera lens, but I wonder if it will fit?
I felt something warm in the depths of my heart.
And that warmth gradually welled up and up.
Eventually, that warmth reached the depths of my eyes, becoming hotter and hotter.
Words wouldn't come together properly in my head. I wanted to say something, but only my lips trembled.
Shiona, holding a steaming cup, was gently watching me like that.
Shiona... my heart feels warm. I wonder why.
Rei, that's an emotion called 'joy'.
Saying that, she approached me and handed me a cup filled with a drink that had a heart-warming aroma.
Everyone is responding to your desire to make Mad smile, Rei. Everyone wants to make Mad happy, with you at the center.
I wonder if I'm being a nuisance... even though I started this on my own.
If they thought you were a nuisance, they wouldn't have such warm smiles on their faces.
I looked at each of the townspeople who had brought parts in turn.
They each held their parts in their hands, held them up so I could see them, and smiled at me.
...Thank you, everyone.
Using the parts and tools I received, I started the repairs on the spot.
I proceeded with the help of various people in areas that I couldn't understand on my own.
I removed the moisture, carefully scraped off the rusted parts with a file, and repaired the broken electronic circuits with copper foil.
I corrected the solder that was about to come off using the tip of a screwdriver heated until it turned red.
No, no, it's not like that, it's like this.
No, no, it should be like this here!
You're both wrong! It's definitely like this here!
No, it's not like that, it's like this.
Noisy, but lively, the repairs were carried out by everyone.
And then, finally...
The repairs were finished in a piecemeal, awkward state.
Thank you, everyone.
It's nothing. In return, let us hear that song again.
The children love it. Please do it again.
Listening to it with him puts me in a good mood.
Listening to that song... it reminds me of the old days...
I love that song, it's so fun!
The clumsy device that everyone made.
It looked nothing like what I had seen in books.
But it was a one-of-a-kind projector, made by everyone.
I felt more joy than I ever had before.
Everyone there was genuinely happy about its completion.
All that's left is to test it out.
Hearing the words "test run," I looked around the room.
Come to think of it, I've never seen electricity in this town.
The photographer was also using an analog camera.
Um... is it possible that this town doesn't have electricity...?
At my question, everyone in the room simultaneously looked shocked.
It was an awkwardness, like I had touched something I shouldn't have.
Even the director who suggested the test run had fallen silent.
It's the library, you know.
It was Shiona who spoke, as if to break the awkward silence.
This town doesn't have electricity, but only the power storage facility remains.
That's the library?
Yes, it is.
It was as if a ray of hope had shone through.
I felt my cheeks soften.
But Shiona's expression... even though she was smiling, her eyes looked somewhat sad.
The next day, I went to the library with Shiona.
Carrying the handmade projector that I made with the townspeople yesterday.
I didn't know there was a device like this here.
Equipped at the library counter was a device that could store electricity made using sunlight in portable batteries.
Apparently, it's the only device left in this town.
However, due to the aging of the solar panels, it's not capable of generating a large amount of electricity.
It means that electrical energy is precious to this town.
Despite my selfishness, everyone in town permitted me to use such a precious thing.
They always said that, if I played the music for them again.
However, there was something I couldn't help but wonder about.
I had a feeling that the library held some special meaning for the people of this town.
Everyone's reaction yesterday... Thinking back, even Mad changed his expression when I went to the library.
...No, I shouldn't make strange assumptions now.
I averted my gaze from the charging battery and looked at Shiona, trying to hide the anxiety in my heart.
I need to have Shiona sing again.
Yeah, I'll sing with gratitude to everyone.
Shiona gives me her usual smile.
Next to Shiona was Tipi.
She's looking at Shiona with a slightly bewildered expression.
Come to think of it, this is the first time I've seen these two together.
Tipi, how long do you think it will take to charge?
Umm... probably about 30 minutes more, I think.
I see, that's surprisingly fast.
I can only be with Rei for another 30 minutes...?
Tipi takes a wide detour around Shiona and hugs my leg.
Her sad expression hasn't changed.
But I felt that her sadness had eased just a little.
I stroke Tipi's head with the palm of my hand.
As I stroke her silky hair over and over, Tipi rubs her cheek against my leg.
...Okay, you two. That's enough.
Shiona wedges herself between me and Tipi.
Ah... Rei, Rei...
Tipi reaches out for me.
But her hand doesn't reach me.
Rei, just a moment...
Shiona grabs my arm and drags me to the wall.
--Shiona's sweet scent tickled my nose.
Rei, Tipi is a girl now. Do you understand what that means?
I know. She's cute when she gets attached to me.
That's not what I mean... I don't think it's good to touch her so casually or get too friendly with her.
Why? I think it's fine if Tipi is happy.
That's not it... I don't think it's good to touch girls of that age so casually.
Even if you say "of that age," Tipi is still a child, right?
Girls mature on the inside faster than they look. She already has a pink heart.
Pink...? What does that mean?
Pink is pink. That's why I don't think it's good.
Shiona seemed more upset than usual.
She's talking to me with a smile, but her cheeks are slightly puffed out.
Come to think of it, whenever I said I was going to the library, her smile always stiffened.
It seems Shiona doesn't like me getting along with Tipi very much.
Even now, it looks like she's competing with Tipi.
"...Hey, Shiona. Could it be that this is the emotion called 'jealousy'?"
At my words, Shiona's eyes widened and she gasped.
She restlessly moved her gaze, avoiding looking at me.
It's the first time I've seen her make such an expression, her who always has a smile on her face.
I reach out and try to pat Shiona's head.
"Eh? Rei...?"
And then, I gently stroke her hair as I do with Tipi.
"W-wa, Rei, what's with you all of a sudden? What's wrong?"
Unlike Tipi's, Shiona's hair is smooth and feels good. A nice scent wafts up every time I stroke it.
It's the kind of hair that makes you want to touch it forever.
"R-Rei? I feel kind of embarrassed, you know?"
"Ah, sorry. But, I somehow thought it would be better to do this."
I don't really understand why, but looking at Shiona now makes my chest feel warm.
A sensation close to the joy I learned about before wells up.
"S-so, anyway, let's refrain from sticking too close together, okay? Promise me?"
"Yeah, if that's what Shiona says, I'll do it."
So, I had no choice but to say that.
We return to Tipi's side.
Tipi looked up at us anxiously.
"What's wrong? Is Tipi a bad girl? Is that why you're both angry?"
Tipi furrows her brow sadly.
"It's okay. It's nothing."
"Really? Really, really not angry? Because Shiona's face... is red?"
"T-this is, it's different, okay? I'm not red and prickly, okay?"
"Hmm... okay, I understand."
Tipi shed tears as if relieved.
Actually, I want to wipe away those tears with my fingertips, but Shiona would surely dislike that.
So I decided to suppress that impulse.
I turn on the projector, which has finished charging.
A low motor sound rings out, and the exhaust fan starts to spin.
The light at the top, which indicates that it is preparing to start, was flashing.
It's been a while since I've seen an electric light. Me, Shiona, and Tipi were all watching the flashing light with eyes as if we were seeing something rare.
"Um... where do I insert the chip..."
The control panel on the side of the projector has a broken and exposed lid.
In the center of it, there is a place to insert the chip.
I slowly inserted the chip I received from Mad.
The projector frantically flashed a red light to indicate that it was trying to check the data inside.
We watched the situation with bated breath.
After about 10 seconds, the flashing interval of the lamp shortened--and turned into a green light.
"This... means it's okay, right?"
Anxiety and excitement mixed, and my voice was strained.
"Yeah, the projector is fixed properly, and the data inside is okay."
Shiona's words made my heart soar. I could feel the corners of my mouth rising naturally.
I felt "joy" at the sense of satisfaction that I had accomplished something new.
After finishing charging the projector and checking its operation, we were heading to Mad's store.
Tipi said she was sleepy and stayed in the library.
I wanted her to see it with us, but Shiona warned me not to push her too hard.
"I wonder if Mad will be happy."
"Y-yeah... I'm sure he'll be happy."
"I hope so. It's something that everyone in town made together. All the more so because everyone's feelings are in it."
"Y-yeah... that's right."
"What's wrong, Shiona? Is something the matter?"
Shiona has been somewhat distant since a while ago.
"No, nothing's wrong."
"Is that so... I feel like something's different..."
"More than that, Rei, it's cloudier than usual today, and my heart is turning gray."
Shiona mutters as she looks up at the sky.
I look up at the sky in the same way, but I can't tell the difference from usual.
Rather, since it rained, the dust in the atmosphere has been cleared away, and I feel somewhat easier to breathe.
"Plus, it's humid, and my feelings are all bumpy. So, Rei, why don't we relax at home today? Let's get fluffy with orange soup."
I wonder if this air is making Shiona uncomfortable...?
No, I think Shiona's words are hiding what she really wants to say.
But I didn't really understand what that meant.
I don't think Shiona would be mean.
"But, we went to the trouble of making it together. I want to show Mad his son's movie soon."
"I see... you're right."
Shiona fell silent after that.
She's not angry.
She's keeping pace with me, walking beside me.
But I could see a shadow in her expression.
We arrived at Mad's store and stepped into the dimly lit interior.
"Hey... what do you think you're doing, barging in here?"
Mad's voice, like a rumble, came from the back of the store.
He was leaning back in his chair, staring straight at us.
"Hello, Mad. Um... this."
I took out the patchwork projector.
Mad glared at it as if he were sizing it up.
"What is that? We don't buy garbage here."
"That's not it. It doesn't look like much, but it's a projector that can play your son's movie."
"My son's movie? I don't remember asking anyone to make something like that."
"I wasn't asked to, that's true. I did it on my own. But, many people in town cooperated to make this. I want Mad to watch the movie with everyone."
"That's why I said I don't remember asking you to do any of that."
"I understand. I did it on my own. So what I'm about to do now, I'm doing on my own. Stop me if you want to."
I tried to step forward.
But from behind, Shiona pulled on my sleeve to stop me.
"Rei, Mad's being prickly and purple... you should give it up for today. How about we try another day?"
"Shiona, we've come this far. Mad may say that, but he must want to see his son's movie. If we don't watch it here, he'll probably never see it."
"Besides, if he really hated it, I'd already be thrown outside."
It's just an assumption based on Mad's past behavior, but I don't think I'm wrong.
"It's okay, Shiona. So don't look so worried. It's going to be alright."
I nodded firmly, trying to dispel Shiona's anxiety.
"...Okay, Rei. If that's what you want, do as you please."
Shiona let go of my sleeve.
I started walking again.
I placed the equipment on the register counter and closed the store door.
Next, I closed all the curtains on the windows.
The already dark store became even darker.
It's just the right darkness for playing a movie.
Then, I turned on the projector, which I had just charged, and the fan whirred to life, and after a while, the attached light turned on.
A square of light appeared on the wall of the store.
I adjusted the lens I received from the photography museum director and focused it.
Mad just stared intently at that action.
"Mad, I'm going to play the movie now. Is that alright?"
"...Do as you damn well please."
Mad didn't deny it.
I'm certain that's the answer Mad wants.
I placed my finger on the button on the control panel...
──Play.
Mad stared at the square of light with a stern expression.
Within the light, a story begins.
It's the story of a certain boy.
It was set in an era when the sky was still blue and nature remained.
Born in a small house in a small town, he didn't know his mother.
The father he lived with only took care of the bare minimum... it was hardly a relationship that could be called family.
And as the boy grew up, the gap between the two deepened.
They would fight whenever they saw each other's faces.
Every short conversation was a denial of each other.
Before long, their eyes stopped meeting.
The boy returned home less and less, and eventually stepped onto the path of evil.
His father silently struck him.
His brow furrowed more deeply than ever...
The boy runs out of the house and leaves town.
But that was the beginning of harsh days.
He was conveniently used and betrayed by those he thought were his friends, leaving him broken in body and spirit.
The one who supported him through all of that was a certain woman.
His meeting with her would lead him down the right path.
The boy washed his hands of evil and decided to move to a new town and start his life over.
──He had a family.
A son was born, and he believed without a doubt that he would continue to live happily with his beloved wife.
But... the woman passed away from an illness.
There was no time to despair.
He worked desperately to raise the child she left behind.
However, he was so desperate to work that he didn't realize a gap was forming in his relationship with his child.
Every time they opened their mouths, they would only fight.
Days of drifting apart continued.
And the grown-up child stepped onto the path of evil, as if to spite him...
He thought it was punishment.
Isn't this exactly what I did to my father?
Now, he curses his immature self.
He thought about how to stop his son, and stared at his hands.
If he opened his hand, he might be able to gently reason with his son, stroking his head and hugging him.
If he clenched his hand, it would become a fist, and he might be able to sternly admonish his son.
As a father, which should he choose?
──He clenched his fist.
The fist that struck his son was hot, his chest ached as if it were being squeezed...deep wrinkles etched into his brow.
But, his son, holding his red and swollen cheek, shed tears.
He had been properly scolded, he was loved...or so he thought.
Hearing those words, he too shed tears.
Why couldn't he have realized what his son had realized back then?
That the face of his father after hitting him wasn't one of anger, but of sorrow.
He took his son and returned to the town where he was born for the first time in 20 years.
The townscape was almost unchanged from when he ran away.
And the small family home, also unchanged.
But his father, who lived alone in that house, looked a size smaller than he remembered, perhaps due to old age.
He stood before his father, biting his lip and shedding tears.
His father silently patted him lightly on the shoulder and muttered only one word.
Mad's son's movie was a very old-fashioned human drama.
I don't know if it's interesting.
If my emotional functions were normal, I might be able to judge.
But Mad was engrossed in the screen.
He watched the movie in silence from beginning to end.
The end credits finished rolling, and the screen went completely black.
It seems to be over.
Shiona glanced at me once before reaching for the projector's stop button.
The moment her slender fingertip was about to touch the button, I grasped Shiona's hand.
"...? Rei?"
Shiona looked at me with a puzzled expression. But I was staring at the screen.
The screen that had been completely black. In its center, letters slowly began to appear.
Those letters, probably handwritten, contained a clear "emotion."
"This film is dedicated to my father."
The letters slowly melted into the darkening screen and disappeared.
This time, the movie quietly came to an end.
Silence fell around us.
Even after I turned off the power, Mad was still staring intently at the place where the screen had been.
"Mad... the movie's over, you know?"
A sigh was the reply to my words.
"...A boring movie."
He muttered that in a small voice that was unlike anything I'd heard from Mad before.
"It was so boring, I got tired of holding back my yawns."
He wiped away the tears that had accumulated from holding back the yawns as if discarding them, then stood up from the chair and removed the chip from the projector.
Then he firmly clenched it in his palm and sat back down in the chair.
"...Just get lost already."
He said that in a monotonous voice, then closed his eyes as if pondering something.
Could it be that the son's feelings didn't reach him through this movie?
Was it just a movie that Mad didn't care about...?
If so, what I did was──
My chest tightened, and I hurriedly called out to Mad, panicking that I had to say something.
But Shiona lightly tugged on my clothes, interrupting me.
"Rei, it's okay."
Shiona smiled, lowering the corners of her eyebrows.
"Mad just can't be honest with himself. Let's leave him alone for now, okay?"
Can't be honest...?
In other words, everything Mad said just now was the opposite of what he meant?
"Mad is very clear right now. He's filled with a beautiful light blue. It's thanks to Rei."
"Is that so... if that's the case..."
I feel warmth deep in my chest.
I know this feeling.
It's the emotion called 'joy'.
I'm happy that Mad was pleased with me.
I'm overjoyed that I was able to be of help.
We quietly left the shop so as not to disturb Mad.
Leaving the projector behind so he can watch movies again, whenever he likes.
When we got outside the shop, we could faintly see an orange glow on the other side of the sky.
It was a color that seemed to reflect my feelings.
I'm really glad Mad was happy.
Yes, me too.
But her smile seemed a little sad.
Huh? What is it?
You look kind of sad.
Really? I'm not. Mad being happy makes my heart feel full.
Really? If you say so.
Hey, Rei. Shall we have a feast today?
A feast? Why?
Because it's the anniversary of Rei making Mad happy.
Anniversary... Yeah, it's an anniversary.
Let's make orange soup and have a fluffy day today, okay?
Yeah, let's do that. I'll help with the cooking too.
Thank you. That makes me very happy, Rei.
Shiona's hand touches mine.
We held hands without either of us saying anything.
The warmth is born within our joined hands.
The orange sky was eventually swallowed by the encroaching darkness of night.
The next day, we decided to sing in the plaza as promised to everyone who helped us repair the projector.
Since we had the chance, we wanted Mad to listen with us, so we visited Mad's shop.
But the doors remained closed.
Even though it was the time he usually opens, a sign reading 'CLOSED' was hanging.
The shop door was locked, and we couldn't get inside.
I peeked inside the shop through the gap in the door.
The projector was left on the counter.
Nothing had changed since yesterday.
The chair Mad was sitting in was obscured by the shelf, so I couldn't see it.
I wonder what's wrong, Mad. Maybe he's not feeling well.
…I knew it would end up like this.
End up like this...? What do you mean?
I tilted my head at Shiona, who spoke as if she knew the shop would be closed.
From the middle of yesterday's movie, Mad's bright red prickliness disappeared.
Bright red... prickliness?
Yeah, I think he didn't need to endure it anymore. It was the first time I'd ever seen Mad so calm.
Shiona smiled, looking troubled.
Was Mad enduring something all this time?
That's right. He really, really wanted to reconcile with his son. He wanted to fly to his son's side. But Mad is always bright red and prickly, right? So he never had a chance.
Then, could it be that yesterday's movie...?
That's right. Because Rei showed Mad his son's movie, Mad was able to be honest.
...Could it be that Mad went to see his son?
Yeah. I think he left town.
Shiona smiled gently. Seeing that smile, I realized that I had really been able to help Mad.
My chest suddenly felt warm, and it turned into words that came out of my mouth.
That's amazing! That's amazing, Shiona! It's just like that movie! It wasn't the son who went to see the father, but it's almost exactly like the movie!
Yes, it is. It's really amazing. But there's just one thing that's troubling me.
Something troubling?
Shiona frowned and sighed softly.
Mad and his son are reconciling, so what could be troubling her?
I don't think Mad will be back for a while, so we won't be able to get the ingredients for the orange, fluffy soup.
Shiona said with a serious face.
That's...troubling, isn't it?
Yeah, it's troubling, right? But if we make it while saving the ingredients we have now, we'll be okay for a while.
Shiona smiled, relaxing her tightened lips.
Looking at her, I felt my cheeks naturally move.
From deep within my chest, something warm welled up.
I don't know what to call this feeling, but I feel very fulfilled.
I hope Mad comes back soon. I'd really like to hear his story. Maybe his son will come with him. That would be even better.
Yes, I agree. I hope that happens.
Little by little, I'm learning to understand emotions. I was really feeling that.
I'm getting closer to the ideal image of myself.
I want to help people more and more.
I want to learn more and more emotions.
That feeling had become my greatest driving force.
Let's get going, Rei. It's getting late.
That's right. Let's hurry. I wonder how many people we can make smile today.
I'm sure it will be a lot. Even more than yesterday.
That's because Shiona's singing voice is beautiful.
No, it's because of Rei's playing.
But all I do is turn the steering wheel.
That's what's important. When the person turning it has a kind heart, the music becomes warm and spreads out softly.
Shiona smiled, gently spreading her hands.
If it were just my singing, I'm sure no one would stop. My singing is only what it is because of Rei's playing. Thank you, Rei.
My face is getting really hot.
Why is that, Shiona? My face feels really hot.
Really? Your face is bright red. You must be embarrassed.
Embarrassed? Is this feeling embarrassment?
Wow, Rei, you're actually pretty shy. That's cute.
Hearing Shiona say that made my face even hotter.
After leaving Mad's shop, we visited the plaza.
Even before we arrived, there were already many people gathered there.
We've been waiting for you two! Thanks again today!
My child has been saying 'Let's go listen to the songs!' since yesterday. Please!
Your songs are healing. Thank you so much.
Big bro, big sis, sing again!
Everyone we met was waiting for our melody.
And everyone had a smile on their face.
This was it.
This is what I was looking for.
To do something, to be liked by people, to be thanked.
This is what I wanted.
What a great feeling.
How warm it feels deep inside my chest.
I wanted to keep experiencing this feeling forever.
Shiona, let's start. Let's make everyone smile.
Yeah, of course.
I turned the music box handle just like yesterday.
The melody overflowed.
Shiona spun a melody to match the sound.
And that melody spread a large circle of smiles.
Smiles spread throughout the town.
More than anything, that made me happy.
And Shiona's profile as she sang happily was my joy.
The townspeople listened with smiles, just like yesterday.
The circle of smiles grew wider.
Suddenly--I felt a slight discomfort in the hand turning the music box handle.
My right hand, gloved to hide the mechanical hand.
I felt a slight creak in the hand turning the handle.
Hey, how was that machine from the other day?
I was spoken to while cleaning up after the performance, and I raised my head.
There was the director, and the townspeople who had provided the parts.
It was restored, and Mad was happy. It's all thanks to you.
I see, that's good. It was worth calling out to everyone.
It's really thanks to all of you, thank you very much.
No, it's nothing... but you know, it's all thanks to your power.
Oh, that's right. Because of your actions, people came forward to help.
But that's because everyone is kind. My actions were just the trigger.
"Of course, that's part of it. But you won't know or change anything unless you act. It's not about who's the greatest or who's amazing. The person who acts first has that much value."
The director and the people who cooperated all had warm smiles on their faces.
"If there's anything else, don't hesitate to ask. We'll help as much as we can."
The director and the others said that and then dispersed.
I watched them leave, thinking.
"Hey, Shiona."
"What's wrong, Rei?"
"I really want to make more people happy."
"Making people happy is a truly wonderful thing."
"Yes, it is. But being able to feel that way is wonderful, Rei."
I was a little happy to be praised by Shiona.
I could feel a gentle warmth deep in my chest.
"That's why I want to help and be useful to many people. I want to meet more and more people and help them solve their problems and troubles."
"If that's what you want to do, Rei, I think it's a good idea."
"Then Shiona, let's go look! Let's go help the people in this town who are in trouble!"
"...wait."
"You see, Rei, I think that's a little different."
I was sure that Shiona would agree with me.
But she shook her head, looking troubled.
"It's certainly wonderful to help people. But, I think it's wrong to force it on them."
"Force it...? I don't intend to do anything like that?"
"Of course, I understand how you feel, Rei. But, people have walls and problems that they have to overcome on their own. If you help them with everything, they won't be able to grow. Of course, it's important to help them, but first, that person has to really try their best, and only when they can't overcome it on their own do they need help. So, Rei, let's help someone when they ask for it. It's not too late to help them then."
I understood what Shiona was saying.
I was able to understand it.
But deep down, I felt something was bothering me.
Why should I leave my desire to help people as it is?
Why shouldn't I help people on my own?
Why, why, why...?
At that point, I stopped thinking.
Because Shiona's smile seemed somewhat sad.
A few days later.
The discomfort resurfaced.
It was the discomfort in my right hand that I had felt when I was playing the music box.
A sensation so small that I couldn't put it into words.
But it was definitely attacking my right hand.
The discomfort was gradually increasing.
After returning to Shiona's house, I tried moving each of my fingertips one by one in my room.
Then, all of my fingers, when bent to a certain depth, would not bend any further.
With this, I can't grab anything.
It's a problem that will interfere with my daily life.
No matter how many times I try, the problem doesn't get fixed.
Perhaps it needs a fundamental repair, like disassembling it once.
I have an idea what might be causing this problem.
It was when I was looking for that projector.
I really overdid it at that junkyard.
I felt a strange sensation when I was moving heavy things.
I'll go to that abandoned factory later today.
And I'll go look for tools for the repair.
"Rei, it's time for dinner."
Shiona suddenly enters the room.
I hurriedly put on my gloves and hid my exposed right hand.
"What's wrong? Why are you in such a hurry?"
"It's nothing. I was just spacing out, so I was just surprised."
"Did I startle you? I'm sorry about that. I'll knock from now on."
"Yeah, thanks. I'd appreciate that."
"Okay, I understand. So, dinner's ready, are you going to eat now?"
I look at the clock.
Before I knew it, the hands of the clock had already passed noon.
"It's already this late..."
"It's always so cloudy outside. You lose track of time, don't you?"
"Yeah, I'll be right there. Will you wait for me?"
"Okay, I understand. I'll be waiting in the kitchen, Rei."
Shiona smiled brightly and left the room.
I took off my gloves again and checked my right hand.
...I have to make sure Shiona doesn't find out, no matter what.
Even if I go to the abandoned factory, it will be after I eat.
I steeled myself and headed to the kitchen.
In the kitchen, Shiona's homemade dishes were lined up.
"Rei, have a seat. Let's eat."
Shiona clasped her hands in front of her face.
I clasped my hands together in the same way.
"Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil."
These words were taught to me by Shiona.
Before I knew it, I had started offering the same prayer.
I've spent that much time with Shiona.
Thinking that, the depths of my heart naturally warmed.
"Huh? It's nothing, really."
"Is that so? You have a happy look on your face? You're all glowy and orange."
"A happy look? Me...?"
"Yes, very, very much so. Rei, you've been making that expression a lot lately. It makes me happy too."
"Does that mean... I'm 'smiling'?"
"Yes, that's right. You didn't smile at all at first, but lately you've been smiling a lot. I'm happy."
"I'm... smiling...?"
I recall the first day I awoke.
That day, the face I saw was expressionless.
From that day on, I kept wishing.
I wanted emotions.
It seems that without realizing it, I've begun to obtain what I desired.
I felt a lightness in the depths of my heart, glad that this was happening.
With this, I can stay with Shiona and the others forever.
I looked down at my right hand.
With this hand, hanging limply without strength, I can't even use a spoon properly.
Reluctantly, I switched to my left hand and scooped up the soup.
Eating with my unfamiliar left hand proved extremely difficult.
"What's wrong, Rei...? Huh? Rei, are you left-handed?"
"No... I'm right-handed, but my right hand is kind of sore today."
"It hurts? That's terrible! I have to call a doctor... Ah, but there aren't any in this town, so I'll have to call one from a distant town..."
"No, it's okay. It'll heal if I leave it alone."
This is bad... this is bad.
If a doctor sees me, my true identity will be exposed.
That alone I must avoid.
I want to stay here forever.
"Surely, it's because you overdid it the other day. Working so hard in the rain..."
"...Yeah, I think that's probably it."
"See, you didn't stop when I told you to. I'm worried about your body, Rei."
"Yeah, thanks. But, thanks to that hard work, Mad was happy, so it was worth it."
"Yes, that's true. But don't push yourself too hard."
Shiona looks at me with a worried expression.
I'll try not to do anything that makes her make that face again.
Seeing Shiona with any expression other than a smile makes my heart turn blue.
"Speaking of which, I wonder if Mad has returned. Has he contacted you since then?"
"Not yet. His son lives a little far away. I'm sure he hasn't arrived yet."
"I see. I hope he contacts you soon."
"Yeah, me too."
After that, Shiona didn't ask me about my right hand.
I finished my meal quickly with my unfamiliar left hand.
Then I returned to my room and began to prepare.
I packed the tools into my bag.
Most likely, I will be disassembling my own arm.
I need to resolve this on my own.
I can't rely on anyone.
That's why I made thorough preparations.
As I was concentrating on the preparations, I heard a knock on the room door.
Immediately after, Shiona came into the room.
"Rei, if you're free, want to go shopping...? Are you going somewhere?"
Shiona asked, looking back and forth between the bag and me.
"Yeah. I'm just looking for something."
"Where are you going? Is it close? Far? When will you be back?"
"I'm going to the abandoned factory. I'm planning to come back as soon as possible."
"Abandoned factory? What are you going there for?"
"Well... actually, the photo studio director asked me for some parts, and I'm going to look for them."
It was a lie.
It was a clumsy lie, but Shiona smiled at me.
"I see... I understand. Please be really careful, okay? Your right hand isn't in good shape to begin with, right?"
"Yeah, thanks. I'll try to get back as soon as possible."
I was seen off by Shiona, and I left the church.
My destination is the abandoned factory--.
But, there was a place I had to stop by before that.
I need to cover up the lie I blurted out on the spur of the moment.
If, by any chance, Shiona meets the director and talks about me, the lie will be exposed.
If that happens, I'll end up hurting Shiona.
I don't want to hurt Shiona.
That's why my feet were visiting the photo studio.
Oh, a rare customer.
When I opened the door, the director, who was polishing a camera, greeted me.
I'm sorry for intruding so suddenly.
No, it's fine... I was just about to head home.
Home... to the church? Did you have some business there?
Ah, just wait a moment.
The director retreated into the back.
While waiting, I decided to look around at the photos on display.
There were various photos displayed, from old photos to recent ones.
The eras, places, and people in the photos were all different.
But there was one thing they all had in common.
That was that everyone was smiling.
I couldn't help but envy the people in those smiling photos.
Well, well, sorry to keep you waiting. Here, this is for you.
The director held out a photo to me.
In it were a smiling Shiona and an expressionless me.
It's a photo I took before. It took some time to develop. I apologize for the delay.
That's not true. Thank you very much. But, I don't have any money...
It's fine. It was my fault for being late, and I wanted to take it anyway. I'll make it a service.
Thank you very much. I'll give it to Shiona.
Please do. Even so, looking at it like this, you and Shiona's brother really do look alike.
You know Shiona's brother?
Ah, of course. Have you ever seen a picture of Shiona and her brother together?
Yes, I have. The one where they're holding a music box, right?
Ah, that's the one. Actually, I took that photo.
Is that so...? When did her brother leave on his journey?
It was right after I took that photo, I think. He said he was going to spread music all over the world. Shiona was so sad. She's always smiling like that, but she was crying the whole time back then.
Shiona was? I can't believe it...
...But, recently, she's started smiling a lot more. As much as when her brother was around... No, maybe even more.
Is that so? I think she's always smiling, for sure.
I'm sure it's because you're here.
I think it's partly because you look like her brother, but I don't think that's all there is to it.
But I haven't been able to do anything for Shiona.
Making someone smile isn't just about doing something for them. You can also make them smile just by being near them, by their side.
By her side... Then I'm confident that I can be by Shiona's side more than anyone else.
I can see that too. When Shiona is with you, she seems to be showing a smile from the bottom of her heart.
Those words warmed my heart.
I'm connected to Shiona's smile.
Because I'm here, Shiona is--
It's strange for me to ask, but will you stay near Shiona forever?
Of course. I'll always, always be by Shiona's side, and keep her smiling. That's my greatest wish.
Hahaha, it's like a proposal. It's a shame Shiona isn't here to see it.
A pro...posal...?
Hearing those words, I felt my face getting hot.
I know the meaning of the word.
It's a vow between a human man and woman to spend their lives together.
Was what I just said the same as that?
Thinking about it that way, my face gets even hotter.
I turn my back to the shop owner so he won't notice my agitation.
Um, well, I have somewhere to be, so...
Is that so? Be sure not to lose that photo.
Yes, thank you very much.
I said my thanks over my shoulder and left the photo shop.
The road to the abandoned factory.
I pushed forward through the reddish-black earth.
The bag filled with tools was a heavy burden.
I could hear the sound of the tools rubbing against each other in the bag slung over my shoulder.
The wind is strong, and it looks like it's about to rain.
It would be self-defeating if I went to repair it and ended up increasing the number of broken parts.
I decided to hurry to the abandoned factory before it rained.
On the way.
In the distance, I spotted something white flickering.
However, the location was too far away, and there was no way to confirm what the object was.
I still couldn't tell how big it was, but the white object seemed to be slowly approaching me.
I tried to focus my eyes and confirm it.
At that moment, a gust of wind blew.
I involuntarily closed my eyes.
When I opened my eyes again, the white object had disappeared from view.
What on earth was that just now...?
For a while, I stood there, frozen in place.
But I can't stay like this.
The clouds are getting more and more ominous.
I have to get to the abandoned factory quickly.
Just as the dark clouds made it look like it was about to rain, I arrived at the abandoned factory.
The inside was still dusty and filled with the smell of oxidized oil.
Immediately, I found a nearby workbench and decided to remove the glove from my right hand.
I'm already used to the exposed parts.
First, I'll try slowly opening and closing my fingers.
The malfunction wasn't fixed, and the movement stopped midway.
What could be the cause?
I took out a light from my bag and peered at my arm, shining the light on it.
It doesn't seem like there's any foreign object stuck in there.
…In that case, it must be a problem with the internal parts themselves.
I took out my tools and began disassembling my right hand.
I felt a sense of unease at disassembling my own hand.
I am now destroying myself.
If I were to disassemble all of this, would I break down?
Is that my "death?"
I wonder what that feeling would be like.
If I die, where will this consciousness disappear to?
And if it were reassembled again, would this consciousness return?
Could that be called being alive?
While thinking about such things in the back of my mind as I disassembled, I arrived at the cause of the malfunction.
The piston rod of the cylinder that supplies oil to the fingers was bent, and oil was seeping out.
It's a part I removed once when I fixed Shiona's music box.
At that time, I used the oil in the cylinder to lubricate the gears of the music box.
It was only a small amount of oil, but it must have been the necessary amount for the intricately moving prosthetic finger.
So even small tears can become big wounds if repeated.
However, if the rod is bent this far, even if I fix it halfway, the oil leak might recur.
The most reliable thing would be to replace this part entirely with a new one.
I stood up and decided to search the area.
Phyloid parts in the process of being made were scattered on the floor.
If it's here at the Phyloid factory, there's bound to be a part that fits my model lying around.
With my right arm disassembled, I searched the factory.
There were many arm, leg, and torso parts scattered around the factory.
The head parts are so elaborate that you might think they're real for a moment if you're not careful.
I searched among them for something that would fit me.
Looking at my exposed right arm, I checked the model number of the part I needed.
That seems to be the model number of the part I need.
I searched for the same model number from the arm parts scattered around.
Am I using something that's so rare?
Even after examining all the parts scattered around the factory, there wasn't one with the same model number.
The state of decay of this factory is much more advanced compared to the place where I woke up.
I can tell that it's a facility that was abandoned a long, long time ago.
In that case, it's understandable that the manufacturing dates are different and there aren't any parts with the same model number.
While panicking, I continued to search for parts and discovered something marked 'AR115'.
Its appearance is as close as possible to the shape of the part that was embedded in my arm.
However, the piston rod and shaft are a little long.
With this, it seems I can replace it with just a little processing.
I placed the arm with 'AR115' attached on the workbench and began disassembling it.
After successfully removing the part, I compared it with the part that was originally embedded in me -- 'HR114'.
It seems that an output terminal that didn't exist in 'HR114' has been added to 'AR115'.
There are no other changes.
I immediately tried attaching that part to my arm.
Unlike when disassembling, the installation work was a little difficult.
While dropping the screws many times, I somehow managed to finish the installation.
When I moved my fingers, I was able to open and close them as before.
However, each time, a dissonant sound of machines rubbing against each other echoed around me.
It seems that the lubricating oil has run out.
Seeking oil, I proceeded deeper into the factory.
When the smell of oxidized oil became stronger, I came across a dark black drum.
When I opened them, all of them were oxidized and unusable.
But in the very back, I found a relatively new drum.
When I opened it, there was a small amount of oil inside with little oxidation.
I scooped up the oil with the oil storage tank installed inside my arm.
Then, I returned the tank to its original location.
After a while, the oil was automatically extracted, improving the smoothness of the mechanical parts.
When I moved them, I could open and close my fingers without any dissonant sounds.
I was able to fix it.
Looking at my smoothly moving fingertips, I felt a sense of clarity spreading deep within my chest.
I put my gloves back on, returned the tools to my bag, and left the factory.
Outside, the wind had become quite strong.
I hope it doesn't rain...
I hurried back to town.
--On the way.
A white object had fallen to the ground.
It fluttered as if being toyed with by the raging wind.
After staring at it for a while, I realized it was a cloak.
With the umpteenth flutter, I could see something wrapped inside.
It had the shape of a person.
Thinking it couldn't be, I rushed over to it, knelt down on one knee, and gently lifted the cloak.
There was a severely injured young man.
The blood flowing from his wounded arm -- I immediately knew he was human.
"A-Are you alright!?"
"U... u..."
As if reacting to my voice, the young man groaned.
His body was painfully injured, and it didn't seem like he could stand up at all.
There were traces near the young man's feet, as if he had crawled there.
The traces were stained with blood, telling a story of hardship.
--I have to help him.
Something like a sense of mission seeped from within my chest into my entire body.
"Please hang in there, are you alright!"
I threw the bag I had on my shoulder to the ground and helped the young man up.
The pain must have shot through him as I shook his body, because he grimaced and groaned even louder.
And then, as if clinging to something, he reached out his hand.
I instinctively offered my open right hand.
Through the glove, my mechanical hand was grasped.
I messed up--I inwardly cursed myself.
But the strength in his hand was so weak that I couldn't shake him off.
The young man slowly opened his eyes and looked at me.
"Y... you... you..."
"A-Are you alright? There's a town nearby. I'll carry you there right away."
"T... town..."
He muttered, as if repeating my words with vacant eyes.
Then, as if confirming the hand he was holding, he traced the glove with his limp fingers.
I'm sure he realized it.
He must have noticed the hard texture, different from that of a human, through the glove.
But it doesn't matter.
This isn't a situation where I can worry about that.
"...D-Do you... l-live... in... th-that town...?"
"T... town... live..."
The young man repeats "town" like a mantra.
The words are weak, as if they're about to disappear at any moment.
I decided to take this young man back with me.
Maybe, just maybe, I can save this person now.
I put his arm over my shoulder and dragged the young man along.
His steps were heavy, and it took a considerable amount of time to advance even ten meters.
But I wanted to help this person... I was filled with the desire to save him.
"You... since when... have you been in... town...?"
The man, who looked like he was about to faint at any moment, asked me.
"It's only been about a week."
"I see... I... see..."
I could feel the young man weakening over my shoulder.
If I don't keep him conscious, he might not come back.
"Please hang in there, we'll be in town soon, very soon. It's not that big, but the people there are all warm."
I desperately spoke to the young man.
If I could talk about something that would interest him even a little, he wouldn't lose consciousness.
"There aren't any doctors, but there are books, so I'm sure we can find a way to treat your injuries."
"...B...book...?"
"Yes! We have everything. I'm sure we can look up anything. So please, hang in there."
"...A...any...thing...?"
"Yes! For sure!"
The young man took a long, slow breath, then muttered softly.
"...Abandon me..."
I didn't understand what he said.
I involuntarily stopped walking.
"...Me... Leave me... here, abandon me..."
"T-There's no way I could do that!"
"I was... attacked by humans..."
"By humans...?"
"I was just... just traveling in search of an ideal... But, an ideal is just... a value..."
The young man took another long breath.
"Because of differences in values... humans... clash, oppose each other, fight... becoming relentlessly cruel... and violent..."
"T-That's not true, humans are warm, they can share many things, and support each other."
"Ah, that is exactly the ideal..."
The young man exhaled all the breath he had taken, and his body went limp.
"...U-Um, please, hang in there! Please hang in there!"
Has he just lost consciousness, or is it something more...?
Unpleasant thoughts swirled around in my head.
I gritted my teeth, looked straight ahead, and started walking towards town.
To help this person, even a second sooner.
Before I knew it, rain started to fall, hitting our backs hard.
Rainwater seeped into my gloves, but this was no time to worry about that.
I frantically carried the young man into the church.
"Rei, what's... Wh-Who is that!?"
Shiona greeted me, looking flustered.
"This person collapsed on the way! He's seriously injured!"
"I understand. Carry him to the back."
Led by Shiona, I carried the young man to a room with a bed.
When I laid him down on the white sheets, the rainwater and blood on his body mixed, spreading into a red stain.
There was no sign of the young man regaining consciousness.
"Rei, I brought some water."
I held the cup Shiona handed me to the young man's mouth.
I poured a little water in.
The young man's throat pulsed as he swallowed.
Even so, he didn't regain consciousness.
Compared to when I first met him, his complexion was considerably paler.
"Shiona, I'm going to the library! I'm sure there'll be medical books!"
Shiona started to say something, then bit her lip.
I was concerned by her reaction, but right now, every second counts.
I left the room, leaving Shiona behind.
Then, not caring about getting wet in the rain, I ran to the library.
"Rei, what's wrong? You're soaking wet."
Perhaps surprised by my sudden entrance, Tipi stared at me with wide eyes.
Without worrying about my ragged breathing, I asked.
"Tipi... do you have any medical books here?"
"Y-Yes, we do."
"Please, can you take me there right away?"
"...Okay."
She must have sensed something was wrong.
Tipi immediately led me to the location.
"Is someone sick?"
Tipi asked, still facing forward as she led the way.
"Yeah... they're injured."
"Is it Rei? Shiona? Or...?"
"No, it's someone Tipi doesn't know. So, you don't have to look so sad."
"But... but, but..."
Large tears streamed down her cheeks.
That young man is someone Tipi doesn't know.
And yet, and yet...
To be able to shed tears for that person, what a kind child Tipi is.
"It's okay... it's okay."
I picked Tipi up and gently wrapped her in my arms.
Hot tears soaked through my clothes.
I could feel a small ache deep in my chest.
Suppressing the pain, I rummaged through the medical books.
But no matter how many books we had, we were just amateurs.
We didn't know what the symptoms were, what treatment to give, or even which book was correct.
I took as many books as I could carry from the library.
Not caring that the books were getting wet, I returned to the church.
When I opened the door, a melody flowed from within.
It was Shiona's singing.
That singing alone was enough to recognize this as a sacred place.
"Shiona, how is he?"
"No... he hasn't woken up. I've done what I can, but..."
I ran to the young man's side.
The bandages wrapped around him must be Shiona's work.
But the young man's face was even paler than before.
I opened the medical books roughly.
I flipped through the pages, searching for something I could do.
But we were far too reckless.
No matter how wonderful the medical book, it was ultimately just a stack of paper.
There was no way we, without the skills, could save someone with medicine from the start.
We were too powerless, too small of an existence.
Shiona quietly began to sing.
Unlike usual, it was a quiet melody, like a requiem.
"...Hmm...this song..."
The young man opened his eyes to Shiona's song.
But his gaze was empty, as if he would disappear at any moment.
"Do you know this song?"
"Ah, it's a nostalgic song... I used to sing it often..."
The young man's gaze traced the ceiling, then turned to me and Shiona.
Suddenly, the young man's expression softened.
"...Ah, so it was here... the world I was searching for was here..."
"What do you mean? The world you were searching for, what is it exactly...?"
Perhaps the young man could no longer hear, as he didn't answer my question.
He just continued to speak unilaterally.
"...A path to coexistence... A world of harmony..."
Having said that, the young man quietly closed his eyes.
And then he didn't move a single inch.
I felt something spilling out from the depths of my heart.
"Hey, Shiona, why won't he open his eyes? Is he sleeping?"
"The power he had just obtained is also rapidly fading away..."
"Hey, I wonder why... Is he just tired, maybe...?"
An indescribable sense of loss hung heavily in the depths of my heart like dark clouds.
Pain ran through me, as if the depths of my heart had been churned up and crushed.
Shiona hugged me from behind.
Her warmth allowed me to calm down a little.
Naturally, I placed my hands over Shiona's hands that were wrapped around my chest.
"Shiona... I, I..."
"Rei... Let's hold a funeral for him."
"A funeral...?"
"It's like a ceremony that's held when someone dies."
"When someone dies..."
With those words, I realized.
Ah, this person has died.
"That's the only way we can mourn the dead."
I couldn't move, listening to Shiona's words.
I couldn't quite process the concept of death that had appeared before my eyes.
"Well, there are preparations to be made, so will you help me?"
I could only give a short nod.
We began preparing for the funeral.
To mourn this young man whose name we didn't even know.
As we proceeded with the preparations for the ceremony, there was only one thing that bothered me.
I had left Tipi, who had been crying so much, in the library.
Was Tipi still crying?
In that dark library. All alone.
"Rei, what's wrong?"
Shiona spoke to me as I paused during the altar decorations.
"Yeah... there's something I'm a little worried about."
"Something you're worried about? What is it? Is it about that man?"
"No, it's not that... it's about Tipi."
"Tipi-chan? What about Tipi-chan?"
"When I went to get the medical book, I told Tipi everything about that person. And then, Tipi started crying... and the worst part is, I left Tipi in the library like that."
"Looking pale, just like that?"
"Yeah, that's right. So, I was thinking that she might still be crying..."
"...Yeah, maybe. I'm sure she's crying in the back of the library."
I could easily imagine that scene.
Thinking about it, I couldn't stand still.
"Shiona, do you mind if I go check on Tipi for a bit?"
Shiona showed me a smile that looked a little sad.
"There's still a little more to prepare for the funeral. So, I'd be happy if you came back soon."
"Yeah, I know. I'll be right back."
"...Okay. See you later."
Shiona still gave me a somewhat sad smile.
I finished decorating the altar and headed to the library.
Carrying the medical book I had borrowed.
I walked through the town, where the rain had subsided a little, with an umbrella.
The townscape was somehow different than usual.
As if something important was missing, lost...
I ran through the town of loss and hurried to the library.
The inside of the library was enveloped in silence, as if blocking out the sound of the rain.
--No, except for one thing.
The sound of a blue-haired girl sobbing from the back.
I followed the sound of that girl's crying.
The girl was in her usual place.
As always, the girl was drawing pictures while shedding tears.
"Ray... Ray..."
When Tipi saw me, she reached out her small hands.
I hugged her small body in response.
As soon as I hugged her, her sobs grew a little louder.
"Ray... what happened to that person?"
I was choked by those words.
"Hey, Ray... Ray..."
"That person... hey... hey, hey..."
Silence had become the answer.
Had Tipi understood everything? She started crying loudly without holding back her sadness.
For that young man she had never met, large tears spilled out.
Ah, why is this?
What is this pain in my chest?
The depths of my chest are being stirred up into a mess.
It occasionally hurt and wounded my chest.
Surely it's something overflowing from the wound opened in my chest.
It overflows from my eyes with heat.
Before I knew it, I was crying.
I was shedding tears for the death of a young man I didn't even know.
Ah, I see.
This is 'sadness'.
A blue emotion.
The emotion that Tipi always keeps lit in her heart.
It's such a painful and difficult thing.
Tears flow endlessly.
I don't know how to stop them.
--No, that's not right.
I didn't want to stop them.
I wanted to keep letting these overflowing hot drops flow.
Surely these drops are an act of healing sadness.
By washing away the sadness accumulated deep within our hearts, we maintain our sanity.
Thinking that, I felt the weight that had been accumulating deep within my chest lighten a little.
And at the same time, I felt that the amount of overflowing tears had increased.
I cried.
We cried.
Letting out sobs, embracing each other, we cried.
Crying, crying, crying...
No matter how long it takes, the tears never dry up.
Just as sadness never withers, the tears continued to overflow.
"Tipi, there will be a funeral soon."
"...A funeral? What... is that?"
"It's a ceremony to say goodbye to someone who has died. Shiona is preparing for it now."
"Say goodbye...? What does 'say goodbye' mean...?"
"It means you won't be able to see them anymore."
"Not see them anymore... No!"
Tipi clings to me tightly.
Her arms were trembling slightly.
"I understand how you feel, Tipi. But you know, precisely because we're sad, we have to say goodbye properly."
"Because we won't see them again, let's say goodbye and see them off. If we don't, I'm sure we'll be lonely and sad..."
"Lonely... sad..."
"Yes, I'm sure we will. That's why we're going to send them off. So we don't become lonely and sad... Can you do that?"
Tipi slowly detached herself from me.
With her face still wet with tears, she looked up at me.
"...I can. Tipi can."
"I see. That's great, Tipi."
When I stroked her head, she looked a little happy.
But those tears never stopped falling.
"Well then, shall we go...? Can you stand?"
"Yes... Just a moment."
Tipi stood up and picked up her teddy bear.
Her constant companion, the stuffed animal, is still in her arms.
We held hands and headed to the church in the rain.
"Merciful and loving God, Father, we entrust to your hands this young man who has completed his journey in life, believing in your only begotten son and in the hope of eternal life."
"Take away all the burdens of this sibling who is leaving us, lead them to the dwelling prepared in heaven, and add them to the communion of saints."
"May we, who are in the sorrow of separation, be supported by the hope of the resurrection promised by the Lord, and may we share eternal joy with the child who has been called to you."
Shiona's voice echoed through the church, which was overflowing with attendees.
No one here should have ever seen that young man.
No one here should know that young man.
Even so, everyone gathered here was mourning the young man's death.
I thought, this is the feeling of caring for others, the connection between people.
Everyone clasped their hands in front of their chests, quietly closed their eyes, and offered a prayer.
Both Tipi and I followed suit.
Shiona's voice solemnly echoed through the church.
It sounded almost like a song she was dedicating to the young man…
After the funeral, the young man was buried in the cemetery behind the church.
For one last farewell, everyone from the town approached the coffin one by one, offering words of parting.
May you have a good next life…
Let's meet again someday…
Eternal rest…
They spoke their heartfelt words.
"Come on, Tipi."
It was our turn, and we approached the coffin.
Tipi stared intently at the coffin containing the young man.
The tears she had been showing until just before the funeral were gone, and she was just staring at the young man expressionlessly.
As if she had lost all emotion.
Just silently.
Staring intently, intently at the coffin.
Seeing this, I felt uneasy and tried to call out to Tipi.
But, a moment before I could, she opened her mouth.
She muttered in a small voice.
Several hours passed since then.
Light shone through the gaps in the clouds where the rain had stopped, which was rare.
It is rare for sunlight to shine through the gray, cloudy sky.
But I wasn't captivated by the beautiful scenery.
Because I was concerned about Tipi's expression during the funeral.
That expression that was too empty to be called sadness.
I don't know what that means.
Even so, there is only one thing I think.
I want to be by her side.
I want to be by Tipi's side and talk to her.
And I want to heal that sadness.
That feeling grows within me.
As I try to open the door to the room, Shiona stops me.
"Yeah, I was thinking of going to see Tipi."
"During the funeral, Tipi looked so sad, I got worried."
"I see... but you know, I'm worried about Rei."
"Yeah. Because Rei, you have such a sad expression."
"Sad... ?"
I touch my face with my hand.
"You can't tell that way, can you? Here, come over here."
I was led by the hand into the living room and made to stand in front of a mirror.
"Look, you have a sad face, don't you?"
My face reflected in the mirror was... pale.
I understand well the meaning of what Shiona always said about Tipi being "pale."
Right now, I have the same face as Tipi.
My heart is calm, but my body is drained of strength, and my expression is sinking as if pulled down by gravity.
"...Yeah, it's the first time I've seen my face like this."
This is... sadness.
Even without shedding tears, when you are captured by this emotion, your expression becomes so "pale."
"Someone has died. It's only natural to have such a face."
What do I even need this feeling for in life...?
It's bitter... painful... heavy, aching, and cold...
I look at Shiona's expression reflected in the mirror.
But she wore a somewhat sad, ephemeral smile.
I'm sure she's forcing herself to smile.
Just thinking about that makes my chest ache.
"Tipi is important, too. But you know, I want you to cherish yourself first."
"Me... cherish myself?"
"Yeah, that's right. Rei cherishing Rei himself."
"Cherish myself... I've never thought about that before."
"Rei, you're so kind. That's why I'm sure you prioritize others over yourself."
"But that's what I want to do."
"I'm a little sad about that. I don't want you to push yourself, Rei."
"I'm not pushing myself."
"Is that so? I can't think that way."
Shiona's arms entwined with mine.
"...I'm worried, you know."
I could feel my heart rate increasing.
I don't know what it is.
But it was certainly stirring my emotions.
I felt kindness in that warmth.
......No, more than kindness... I feel a different kind of warmth, different from what touches my skin.
"Hey, Rei, how about some tea?"
"...Tea? Why?"
"When you drink something warm and fluffy, your heart feels fluffy too. It's really nice because it relaxes both your mind and body."
"But Tipi..."
"Tipi is probably shaken by the death of that person. But you know, I'm sure she can overcome it. So let's leave her alone for a little while. Being alone is very important, you know?"
"Do you think so?"
"Yes, I'm sure of it. Because if you don't, you can't become strong."
"People can become stronger by overcoming walls and sorrows. But if they are helped by someone every time, they cannot grow easily. In order for Tipi to grow, let's leave her alone today, okay?"
Tipi is a weak being.
She's always crying.
But, if you're saying it's a chance for her to grow...
I'll accept that.
"Shiona, will you make me some tea?"
"Of course. Will you sit in a chair and wait?"
I sat on the sofa and waited for Shiona's tea.
After waiting for a while, a nice scent filled the room.
"Sorry to keep you waiting. Here's a special, heartwarming tea. Enjoy."
The offered teacup was filled with an orange-colored drink.
A faint sourness and a delicate sweetness wafted through the air.
Like this. It's been a while since I've had a chance to talk to you slowly, Rei.
Yeah, it has been. A lot has happened...
Rei, how's your memory?
No, it doesn't seem like it's coming back yet.
I see... But, there's no need to rush. You might just suddenly remember something someday.
Yeah, thanks... But, I feel bad.
Feel bad? About what?
I'm being allowed to stay here, but I haven't been able to repay Shiona for her kindness at all.
That's not true. I'm just happy to have you by my side, Rei.
But that's not repaying you at all.
It's not just that. You fixed the music box, too... Thanks to that, I can sing now.
You were singing before that, Shiona.
But you know, it's very different with and without a melody. Remember when we performed together in the plaza? Actually, I sang in that place many times.
In that place... Alone?
Yeah. But, you know, no one would listen to me then.
Even with such a wonderful singing voice? That's strange.
Hehe, thank you. But, that's how it is. So, I was very happy when you brought the music box with you, Rei.
That... I was just turning the music box.
That makes me happy. Just being next to me, that's what makes me happiest.
I feel the same way. I'm happy to be with you, Shiona.
......Hehe. Thank you. Rei, you've become so much more expressive.
Expressive? Me?
Yes. Your expressions are much richer than when we first met.
That was what I sought, what I desired.
It was what I had been longing for ever since I woke up.
Being told that by Shiona fills my heart.
The incomplete me is becoming more like a human... I'm getting closer to Shiona, that's what she's telling me.
I'm sure it's because you're always smiling next to me, Shiona.
Is that so? I haven't done anything.
No, it's because you're here, Shiona. Thank you, I'm grateful.
If you're going to say that, then so am I. Thank you, Rei.
I'm the one who should be thanking you.
I'm the one who... Hehe, it's funny. We're just thanking each other over and over.
You're right. What are we even doing?
...But you know, it's strange.
What's strange?
I'm thinking that I wish this time could last forever... That's strange, isn't it?
...No, not at all. I was thinking the same thing...
...Can I come over there?
Shiona sits next to me.
A distance where I can feel her warmth.
We were closer than ever before.
Huh...? What is it...?
What's wrong?
Somehow, my body feels strange. My chest... it's pounding.
Could it be that I've broken down? I'd be troubled if it's a major malfunction that requires maintenance.
It's okay. I feel the same way. My chest has been pounding the whole time.
Huh? A-Are you okay? Does it hurt?
Yeah. This is a wonderful thing.
Shiona gently smiles shyly as she places her hand on mine.
Softly, as if enveloping it.
I responded by turning my wrist. As if to align our palms... as if to intertwine our fingers.
I feel Shiona's warmth even more strongly.
And that warmth warms the depths of my heart.
The depths of my heart are warm, like, gently...
Your heart...? Here...?
Shiona's hand reaches for my chest.
The place she touched instantly became hot.
Shiona's hand feels so hot... I wonder why. Could it be that I'm sick?
No, that's not it.
Do you know the cause, Shiona?
Yes, probably.
Tell me.
Hehe, what should I do?
Don't be mean. I'm curious.
Hmm... but you know, it's not just you, Rei.
The getting hot part?
Yes, that's right. My heart is also very hot right now.
Shiona too?
Yes, the same. Maybe I'm in even worse shape than you, Rei.
That's terrible! How can we fix it?
No, we can't fix it... we don't have to fix it.
My heart is hot, it's tight, it's painful, it's sad, but it's warm... and that's okay. That's good, Rei.
Shiona's hand, which was on top of mine, got a little hotter.
I squeezed her hand back.
Rei, please.
I want you to stay with me forever.
Yeah... will you stay with me forever and ever?
Yeah... I promise.
Thank you, Rei. I'm so happy... so, so...
Shiona rested her head on my chest.
I felt like my heart was being filled up by that.
It's similar to the feeling of joy I felt before, but it's an even stronger emotion.
What do humans call this?
I wanted to ask Shiona, but I thought it would be impolite to break this atmosphere.
So, just like this... I'll entrust myself to time with Shiona.
The sweet-smelling tea prepared on the table. We stayed like that until the steam disappeared.
The next day, I was getting ready to go out after finishing breakfast.
Shiona, who was washing the dishes, called out to me.
I was thinking of going to the library.
The library... are you going to see Tippy?
Yeah, that's the plan.
I'm sure Tippy is still in the middle of getting over it. So, shouldn't we leave her alone?
Yeah... but if I think about her being lonely and unable to overcome it, I can't just leave her alone.
Just like Shiona was by my side yesterday and made me feel warm, I think I can support her just by being near her.
It's okay. Tippy isn't that weak.
Do you think so...?
Yeah, I'm sure of it. More importantly, Rei, I have a favor to ask. Won't you go to the plaza today?
To the plaza? Why?
I'm bringing my music box... I thought we could sing again.
Yeah, something sad happened, right? So, it's important to rest your heart, you know.
Rest my heart...?
We had a funeral, and I think everyone in town is feeling down too. So, don't you want to brighten everyone's spirits?
...Everyone in town? Of course, I do.
It's painful to see sad faces.
If I can, I want to heal that sadness.
Our melody is what can do that. I'm sure it will help the town regain its energy.
I see... Do you think so?
Yeah, I'm sure of it. Come on, let's get ready.
Urged on by Shiona, I reach for the music box.
The music box, which I maintain every day, is always ready to play music.
We set off for the plaza.
It was a cloudy afternoon.
There were hardly any people there.
There's no one here, Shiona.
It's always like this at this time. Before you came, Rei.
Before I came...?
I told you, didn't I? Ever since you started playing music, everyone started listening to my songs. The people in town are slowly changing. They're going out more, and interacting more. I feel like the connections between people are slowly getting stronger.
It's because I came...?
Yes, I think so. Ever since you came, Rei, the people in town have been changing. In a good way, of course.
That was a very happy thing to hear.
I'm being helpful to someone.
That fact makes my joy unstoppable.
Rei, you look happy.
Yeah. Your cheeks are relaxed.
My cheeks?
Yeah, look--
Shiona's fingertip touches my cheek.
Just that makes me feel the warmth deep in my chest again.
My face feels kind of hot.
Rei, are you blushing? Ahaha.
My face gets even hotter.
It seems Shiona is right on the mark.
Well then, Rei, shall we begin?
Yeah, is everything ready?
Whenever you are.
Shiona slowly closes her eyes.
I felt like I could look at her beautiful profile forever.
But just as much, I also want to hear Shiona's singing voice.
And so, I slowly began to turn the handle of the music box.
Shiona's singing voice rides on that melody.
The two melodies melted together, their beautiful tones echoing around.
Soon, people begin to gather.
At first, the people had slightly gloomy faces, but gradually they began to smile again.
And before anyone knew it, a large circle of smiles had spread across the plaza.
Town child A
Town person A
Town person B
Town person C
Town person D
Smiles and words from various people are flying around.
Ah, this is it.
This is what I was looking for.
People with happy smiles.
Each time I see those smiles, my joy is amplified.
I was saddened that that girl wasn't in the circle.
The blue-haired girl in the back of the library.
The girl who will never visit here.
The girl who remains shut up in that library.
I couldn't stop thinking about that girl.
Shiona's voice brings me back to my senses.
"Sorry, I was just thinking about something."
"I see... everyone's already gone home."
Looking around, the people who had been in such a large circle were now sparse.
It seems I was lost in thought for a very long time.
"What were you thinking about?"
"Hmm... no... nothing really..."
"Shall I guess? It's about Tippy, isn't it?"
My heart was seen through so easily. So I honestly nod.
"...Yeah, that's right."
"I knew it... are you really that concerned?"
"Yeah, I'm concerned. Because she's still such a small child."
"A small child, huh... I guess so."
"Besides, she's always all alone. There's no way she's not lonely."
"But she's always been like that. She's used to it now."
"That's not true."
"After all, Shiona, you said it yourself. That the townspeople have changed since I came."
"Yeah, that's true..."
"Then I want Tippy to change too. It's not right for her to be lonely like that."
I repeat what Shiona taught me, as if returning the favor.
Hearing those words, Shiona's smile clouded over slightly.
She looked towards the library, pursed her lips for a moment, and then turned back to me with a smile.
"Let's go home, Rei?"
"It's going to rain from noon today. Come on, let's go home... okay? I'll make fluffy white soup for you."
Pulled by Shiona's hand, I was half-forced to leave the plaza.
Then, a few hours later.
Shiona called out to me again as I was about to leave the house.
"Um, I was thinking I'd like to read a book..."
"If it's books, I have a few that my brother used to read."
"Not those... well, it's a genre of book that I'm sure isn't here."
"What kind of genre is it?"
"Books about machines. I've been interested ever since I fixed Mad's the other day."
"I see. I'm glad you're interested in something, Rei."
"Yeah, thanks. So, I'm going to go to the library."
"Does it have to be today?"
"Yeah, the sooner the better. I want to read it as soon as possible."
"But, it's going to rain soon, you know?"
"The weather doesn't matter. I'll go even if it rains."
"But the book might get wet, you know?"
"It's okay, I'll take a bag with me."
"Hmm... then I'll go and borrow it for you."
"Eh? No, it's okay, I'll go myself."
"No, it's fine. I also have some shopping to do, so I'll go there on the way."
Saying that, Shiona returns to her room.
I wonder why.
I feel like Shiona is trying to keep me away from the library.
No, that's not it.
It would probably be more accurate to say she's keeping me away from Tipi.
I don't know what that means, but it seems to be a fact that she doesn't want us to meet.
Shiona says it gently, but I can feel her feelings.
But, why on earth?
"I'm ready, Rei. What kind of book should I borrow?"
"You probably wouldn't understand even if I told you, so I'll go with you."
"No, it's okay. You can relax, Rei."
"Then... I want you to borrow a book that has electronic circuits in it."
"Electronic circuits, huh? Got it. Well then, I'm off."
Shiona went out.
Waiting for a few minutes.
Shiona must be out of sight by now.
I reached for the door leading outside.
...That's strange.
It's not locked.
But the door wouldn't open no matter what.
It's as if it's bolted from the outside.
--Could it be, that's what's happening?
When Shiona left, she locked a lock that could only be locked from the outside without me noticing.
That's why I can't get out of this door.
--But, why?
--For what purpose?
I returned to the living room, holding my head.
When I glanced at the table, there was a piece of paper that hadn't been there before.
It's a note left by Shiona.
To Rei,
I think you were surprised that it was locked.
Do you remember me telling you that a nearby town was attacked?
So, I'm locking the door as a precaution.
Please stay home and be good.
I've prepared soup and bread for your meal.
Please heat it up and eat it.
So that I never go outside.
I've heard about humans who repeat plunder from that deceased young man as well.
Perhaps those humans are coming near here.
If that's the case, going outside is dangerous.
I see. Shiona was worried about me.
But, if that's the case, then it's dangerous for Shiona to go outside as well.
Shouldn't I, as a man, have been the one to go shopping?
--I mustn't deceive myself....
It's certainly true that there are humans who plunder.
Even so, is it necessary to lock the door from the outside?
Rather, if it's locked from the outside, then the key to open it can also only be used from the outside.
Entry into the house becomes easier.
--That's strange.
If she was really wary of humans who plunder, she wouldn't have sung in the plaza yesterday.
She wouldn't do something that would intentionally gather people.
If that's the case, then why?
--There's only one thing I can think of.
She locked me in.
To keep me away from Tipi.
There's no way Shiona would do something like this without thinking.
There must be a reason.
And it must be something she's doing for me.
...Could something have happened to Tipi?
Is she trying to keep it from me?
Something that's not good for me... so I won't be sad knowing about it...
I couldn't sit still.
I want to see Tipi. I want to confirm it.
A blue-haired girl, crying alone in the library.
I wanted to wipe away that girl's tears.
I look around inside the church.
There was a window in a considerably high position.
Even if I can climb up, there's no guarantee I can get out and down safely.
But that's the only way to get out of here.
Suddenly, a white cloth caught my eye.
A curtain swaying in the wind.
There are several of them in the room, long, large, and sturdy to cover the large windows.
I remove the curtains from all the windows.
From the sky closed off by dark clouds, there is no sign of sunlight pouring in.
When I tie the five curtains together on the table, they become quite long.
It's long enough to reach down to the first floor.
I tie the end of the curtain to the window lattice.
I wrapped it many times and checked the strength repeatedly.
It's okay.
It should be able to support my weight alone.
I tie the other end of the curtain to myself.
And with determination, I leaned my body out of the window.
The ground visible from there looks very far away.
I feel a little dizzy, but I can't back down now.
Gripping the curtain tightly, I slowly lower my body.
On the way, a strong wind shook me.
While my body was swinging like a pendulum, I was doing my best to cling to the curtain.
I waited several minutes for the wind to stop.
I took a deep breath and resumed lowering my body.
It probably took about ten minutes for my feet to finally reach the ground.
My body was so exhausted that I almost collapsed on the spot.
But there's no time to rest here.
I started walking towards the library where the blue-haired girl is waiting.
As if to hinder my feelings, rain quietly begins to fall.
As if to moisten the parched town, its intensity gradually increases.
Not caring about getting wet, I continue to walk without an umbrella.
The wet clothes stuck to my bare skin, making me feel uncomfortable.
I shielded my right hand, covered in a glove, from the rain.
Puddles started to form underfoot, and distant thunder could be heard.
My rough breathing occasionally brought rainwater into my mouth.
Contrary to my body heating up, cold rain lashed at me from the outside.
Spitting out the rusty-tasting rain, I finally arrived.
At the library where the blue-haired girl was waiting alone.
The inside was dimly lit, and no light was leaking out.
Is she buried alone in that dark sea of books again, I wonder?
Just thinking about it made my chest ache terribly.
I entered the entrance and proceeded to the depths where the blue-haired girl was waiting.
"You came after all..."
A voice came from the back.
It wasn't Tipi's.
It was the very person who kept me away from here--.
"I wrote in the note that it's dangerous outside, so you shouldn't go out, right? Or maybe, you didn't see it?"
"No, I saw it."
"I see... So you knew and came anyway. Rei is a bad boy."
Shiona's laughter could be heard, giggling.
But her expression wasn't clearly visible in the dimly lit hall.
"Why did you lock me up?"
"Locked you up...? Well, I guess that's how it turned out. I'm sorry."
"You must have a reason, right? Would you mind telling me if you're okay with it?"
"...Reason? The reason is simple. I don't want you to see her."
"You don't want me to see her...?"
"The blue-haired girl up ahead."
"Tipi? Why?"
"I can't tell you that. It's top secret."
"Wait, I don't understand what you're saying. Why can't I see Tipi?"
"That's... because it's not allowed."
"That's not a reason! Tell me properly!"
"I can't tell you the reason."
I couldn't help but raise my voice.
At the same time, I noticed that my chest was burning red and hot.
Is this "anger?"
Am I feeling anger towards Shiona...?
I don't mean to. I just want her to tell me the truth.
But my words just now seemed to have upset Shiona.
I can't see her expression clearly in the darkness, but the atmosphere coming from her has changed.
An air of hesitation, as if she's struggling to say something.
Shiona opened her mouth slightly, as if to say something... but then closed it again.
Then, tilting her chin down as if to look down, she whispered.
"...Because it will lead to unhappiness."
"Unhappiness? Who?"
"...You, me... and everyone living in this town, I guess."
"The people in town? Because we meet? I don't understand what you're saying."
"I know, you might not understand now. But I'm sure you'll regret it later."
"Why would I regret it? Hey, Shiona, tell me clearly. I'm not that smart, so I don't understand unless you tell me clearly..."
"In other words, it's like this..."
The sound of boots.
In the dimly lit entrance, Shiona approaches me.
The next thing I felt was warmth.
And, softness.
Shiona was hugging me.
"Shiona... huh? W-what...?"
"Please, Rei... won't you just go home with me?"
"Go home...? What do you mean?"
"It's really not good for you and Tipi to meet. To be precise, if you meet, a chain of bad things will happen. So..."
"Could it be that I made Tipi angry? Is that why she doesn't want to see me, or something like that?"
"No, it's the opposite. Tipi loves you very much, Rei."
"Then--"
"That's why, we can't meet. Please understand."
Shiona's arms around my waist tightened.
A sweet fragrance enveloped my entire body, making my head spin.
"...Is that, Shiona's wish?"
"Yes, it is. It's my heartfelt request."
"If I were to meet Tipi, what would Shiona think?"
"I would be very, very sad. I think I'd feel blue and prickly."
"Why? Why would Shiona feel that way?"
Shiona pulled her face away from me and looked up at me with upturned eyes... 
And said with a determined look.
"Rei... because I love you."
"L-love...?"
Those words almost made my mind shut down.
Sweet breath.
Lips that seemed about to touch.
Hands around my waist.
Touching body temperature.
We were as close as we could possibly be.
And then, those words just now.
Though it was just a word connecting two simple characters, it was filled with very deep emotion.
These words were filling my heart with incredible force.
I was feeling an unprecedented level of "joy."
To be needed by someone. To have a certain level of emotion poured into me by a specific someone.
I don't know any greater joy than this.
And now, I am about to obtain that joy.
I put my limp arms around Shiona's back.
Shiona accepts it.
The warmth deep within my chest increases.
"Shiona, I..."
"Yes, Rei. I understand. So let's go home, to our house..."
Shiona's hand is linked with mine.
I turned on my heel and started walking towards the library exit.
"...Thank you, Rei. But you know, this is for the best. This is for your sake."
I felt a sense of incongruity at Shiona's words.
Shiona called out to me with a puzzled expression as I suddenly stopped walking.
"Shiona, you just said, 'for my sake,' right?"
"Yes, I certainly did."
"No, Shiona."
"No? What's different, Rei?"
"If you're saying it's for my sake, then this is wrong."
"It's not wrong. Doing this is for your sake, Rei."
"It's wrong. Because, I'm happy when I can be of use to someone. I'm here to be of use to someone. But now, I'm trying to disappear from the person I can be of use to. That's not my joy, and it's not for my sake. So, who is this for, then?"
"Shiona, I'm going to Tipi's place. It's for no one else's sake, but my own. If someone ends up unhappy because of this, then it's my fault. But even if that's how it turns out, I won't stop. Because that's the result I wanted."
I released Shiona's hand and rushed back into the entrance.
Shiona's voice didn't reach my back.
Shiona just stared silently, without saying anything, with a sad expression.
I passed through the rain-scented entrance and moved deeper into the library.
I could feel the moisture on the soles of my shoes being absorbed into the carpet with each step.
The dry air of the library clung to my wet skin.
I continued to feel unwell.
That might be related to what happened with Shiona earlier.
My chest ached, as if I had swallowed something heavy.
Shiona's face flashed through my mind again and again.
Every one of them, wearing a sad smile.
Why did things turn out like this?
Why did I do something like this?
A wave of regret washed over me.
But, I couldn't stop walking.
--That girl is deeper inside.
A girl who is always alone.
A girl who is always blue.
A girl who is always shedding tears.
I couldn't bring myself to leave that girl alone.
That's why I'm walking down this hallway.
Paintings were hung on the walls of the hallway.
These were the paintings that Tipi apparently drew one each day.
In the paintings drawn on brand-new paper, a single girl was depicted.
I immediately knew who that girl was.
A girl drawn small and alone in the large paper.
Tears streamed down her cheeks.
All of the recent paintings had the same composition.
A painting of a solitary girl crying.
Seeing those paintings, my chest ached terribly.
The girl had been alone all this time.
I felt like I understood her sadness.
I wanted to quickly wipe away that sadness.
I wanted to tell her that she wasn't alone.
I wanted to tell her that I was by her side.
Dragging my wet soles, I advanced down the long hallway.
As I gazed at the paintings hung at a height Tipi could reach, I continued forward.
At that moment, I suddenly felt a sense of incongruity.
It wasn't because of the content of the paintings.
The problem was the number of paintings.
No matter how you look at it, Tipi is a girl who hasn't even reached adulthood.
Even if that child drew a picture every day, could she really have drawn this many?
…Perhaps there were days when she drew several pictures in a single day.
Even so, the number of these paintings is impossible.
Was the girl that lonely?
Did she have nothing else to do but draw pictures?
Ah, why did I leave the girl alone?
How many tears did I make her shed because of that?
The amount of tears in the girl in the paintings increased with each passing day.
It seemed to represent the way the girl's sadness was deepening.
I hurried.
To the girl who must be crying alone in the depths of this place.
In order to heal that sadness.
And to wipe away those tears.
To hold the girl. To hold her body in these two hands.
I walked as quickly as I could, to the deepest part of the library, until I was out of breath.
The girl wasn't there, in the place she should always be.
Her bear plushie, which she always kept close, wasn't there either.
All that was there was an unfinished drawing and crayons.
In the unfinished drawing, there was a picture of a girl crying all alone.
Where could Tipi have gone?
I searched around the bookshelves, but I couldn't find her.
Could she be somewhere in this library?
Or outside this library?
I don't know the truth.
I won't know until I try to find Tipi.
I started walking.
Weaving through the bookshelves, I searched for the figure of the blue-haired girl.
The vast library grounds were not suitable for searching for someone.
In addition to that, there's this darkness.
You can't find anything just by looking from the edge of the bookshelf.
I'll have to check step by step, with my own feet.
I walked between the bookshelves, from the back of the library towards the entrance.
Before I knew it, the clothes that should have been wet were starting to dry.
And it was around the time my hair had completely dried.
That's when I finally managed to find the girl.
The girl was on a large stepladder, arranging books on the shelf.
The girl is a resident of this library and also serves as a librarian.
She's probably returning the books that the townspeople have returned to their original locations.
That's a harsh thing for this little girl to do.
The thousands of bookshelves in this library are stacked to the height of the ceiling and connected.
I don't even want to think about the number of all the books in the collection, it's terrifying.
The girl faces such a large number of books and manages them like this every day.
All alone, inside this library.
Thinking about that, I couldn't help but feel a tightening in the depths of my chest for some reason.
Tipi stretches on top of the stepladder, returning books bigger than her face to the shelf.
After finishing that task and taking a breather, Tipi turned her face towards me.
"...Ray! ...W-w-w-w-what..."
Tipi, noticing my presence, loses her balance on the stepladder.
"That's dangerous, Tipi!!"
The stepladder falls over.
Tipi's hand reaches out.
Responding to that hand, I reached out with both of my hands.
--The impact pierces through my chest to my back.
When I realized it, I was holding Tipi in my arms, falling backwards onto the floor.
"Ray...you came for me, Ray...!!"
Tipi rubbed her cheek against my chest over and over.
Relieved, I stroked Tipi's head.
Her soft hair welcomed my hand.
"Tipi, are you hurt anywhere? Are you injured?"
"I'm okay. Is Ray hurt anywhere?"
"I'm fine. Thank you for your concern."
"You saved Tipi... I love you, Ray..."
The little girl's hands gripped my clothes tightly.
I felt a slightly wet and warm sensation on my chest.
Tipi is shedding tears.
But they seemed like different tears than usual.
Surely they are tears of relief.
I must be able to lighten Tipi's heart a little just by being here.
Thinking that, joy rushes through me.
"Tipi was putting the books away. I'm a good girl, right? Right?"
"Yes, you're a good girl. You're a very good girl."
"Hey, pet me. Because I'm a good girl, pet Tipi's head."
"Yeah... Tipi is a good girl, a good girl..."
I stroked her silky hair.
"Yay... Ray is petting my head. Tipi is so happy..."
"Do you always put the books away?"
"Yeah. I'm fixing the books. Because I want lots of different people to read them."
I look up at the bookshelf.
Indeed, some of the books are quite old.
Some have worn spines, and some are discolored.
Tipi is repairing these...?
I remember wetting the books in the rain.
If I handle them roughly, I'll end up increasing Tipi's workload like this.
I vowed from the bottom of my heart to treat them with care.
I sit up and lean my back against a nearby bookshelf.
"Sorry I'm late."
"It's okay... Ray came here like this, after all."
"Were you okay by yourself?"
"No... I was very, very lonely."
"Were you crying?"
"Yeah... yeah, yeah..."
Tipi presses her face against my chest.
Occasionally, I could hear her sobbing.
"It's okay, I'll be with you forever now."
"Forever? Ray, will you stay with Tipi?"
"Yeah, that's right. I'll try to come to the library as much as possible."
"Won't you live together with me?"
Tipi raised her face.
Large tears were welling up in her eyes.
"That's a little difficult. I'm currently being taken care of by Shiona."
"But, I'll come every day. That's enough to keep you from being lonely, right?"
"Yeah... but, the nights are very lonely."
"The nights, huh..."
"It's dark, and quiet... Sometimes Tipi thinks she might be all alone in the world."
"That's not true. That's not true..."
All I could do was hug Tipi.
A sweet scent wafts from Tipi.
A sweet scent different from Shiona's.
"Yeah, I know... Just you coming here like this makes Tipi happy. Hey, Ray. Is it okay if I ask you something?"
"Yeah, what is it? Tipi."
"Will you help me?"
"Yeah... of course, it's the least I can do."
I stood up and took Tipi's hand.
Pushing a cart filled with several books, we strolled through the library.
"Next is... um, a book called 'The Philosophy of Mind and Body'."
"In that case, it's Easy 493, third shelf from the top, 13th book from the right."
As soon as I said the book's title, Tipi stated its location without missing a beat.
It was as if she knew every single book in this library.
Just as she said, there was indeed a gap for one book in the specified location.
When I inserted it, it fit perfectly.
Tipi wasn't just saying things randomly.
She was indicating the book's location with certainty.
I became interested and decided to ask a slightly mischievous question.
"Hey Tipi, can I ask you something?"
"Do you remember the opening part of this novel?"
What I presented was a rather old novel.
Tipi stared intently at the title, and began to recite as if opening a book in her mind.
"'Looking down, there was a height of five stories. Cream-colored bricks were laid right next to the school building, creating a walkway that would be pleasant to stroll along. Right next to the walkway was a flower bed, and even from this height, you could see the colorful flowers. If I were to throw myself from here, would the cream color and the flowers all be stained with my dirty blood?'"
Tipi recited it flawlessly, word for word.
It matched the handwritten text in the novel perfectly.
"Could it be that you remember all the books here?"
"Hmm... I don't know."
"Then, what about this book?"
After glancing at the book I presented, Tipi began to recite fluently.
"'The human body is composed of approximately 206 bones, starting from the head with the occipital bone, frontal bone, temporal bone, parietal bone, sphenoid bone, ethmoid bone, malleus, incus, stapes, inferior nasal concha, lacrimal bone, nasal bone, vomer, maxilla, palatine bone, zygomatic bone, mandible, hyoid bone, then connecting to the cervical vertebrae, and spreading to the thoracic vertebrae, lumbar vertebrae, sacral vertebrae, coccygeal vertebrae, ribs, and sternum.'"
"...Then, what about this one?"
I presented another handwritten book, this one titled 'The Complete Book of Pi'.
"What about the beginning of this 'Soulless Child Theory'?"
"'All things are finite, and even the soul is no exception. A child born after the soul is exhausted will be a soulless vessel. - Edward Morgue'"
Tipi has memorized every single book here.
But, why?
Even with incredible memorization skills, she would first need to read all these books.
Even if she read every day, she could never finish reading this sea of books.
What on earth is going on...?
"Ray, what's wrong?"
"No, it's nothing. Come on, let's put the next book away."
There's no point in thinking about something I can't find an answer to.
For now, I'll focus on helping Tipi with her work.
After returning all the books to the shelves, we sat down in our usual spot.
"Ray, thank you for helping me."
Tipi is being even more affectionate than usual.
Is it a reaction to not being able to see me until now?
The way she clings to me is cute and endearing.
"It's okay, Tipi. You're always doing this alone, right?"
"Yeah... I'm always, always alone. I'm lonely."
"...Since when have you been alone?"
That might have been a forbidden question.
Tipi looked up at me sadly.
"Tipi has always been alone, for a long time."
And then, Tipi told me her story.
A sad story of how Tipi came to be alone.
"Papa, Mama."
It was a story from when Tipi's parents were still in the library.
The girl loved them very much.
She loved her kind mother and father very much.
Her mother was always smiling and would gently hug Tipi.
Her father was always organizing books, gently watching the two of them.
"Tipi is still such a spoiled child."
Her father took out an electronic device for books from the desk.
"Oops, that's right. Tipi liked this one better."
He put away the electronic device with a wry smile and took out a "book" made of paper instead.
The technology of printing had already become obsolete, and now it was a precious cultural relic.
"Welcome, Tipi."
She was called onto her mother's lap and sat down happily.
And on Tipi's lap was a bear plushie that her parents had chosen for her.
Tipi enjoyed every day.
She enjoyed the days she spent with her beloved mother and father.
And there wasn't a day she didn't feel happy.
Her mother always praised the pictures Tipi drew.
"You're sure to be an artist someday. Your father is so proud."
Her father always had hope for Tipi's future.
She wished those days would last forever.
She wanted to stay together, just the three of them, forever.
Tipi always thought so.
Before she knew it, the days when her parents frowned increased.
Tipi didn't like that expression.
The town also seemed restless.
The adults were all talking about something, saying the same things.
But the young Tipi didn't understand what it meant.
She only felt a rising anxiety that their life as it was would be destroyed.
One day, the phone rang.
To Tipi, that sound seemed very sad.
The father who answered the phone began to frown.
That expression that Tipi didn't like.
The father who put down the phone was talking about something with the mother.
After a while, that talk turned into an argument.
They were arguing about something.
The only thing I understood was that watching the two of them argue was very sad.
"Tipi, will you listen to me?"
After a while, her mother looked at Tipi with a serious expression.
Behind her was her father--and packed luggage.
Tipi intuitively realized that their life as it had been would not continue.
"Right now, terrible things are happening in the world."
"Many people are scared, and they can't sleep at night. Tipi, you don't want that, do you?"
"There are children all over the world who feel that way. If we can, Mommy wants to help them."
"Yes... I knew Tipi would say that... So, Tipi, what I'm going to say now is important. It's okay if you don't understand, but will you listen?"
"Actually, your father and I have to go far away to help those children. Even if we go, we might not be able to change things... But there's a possibility we can."
"No. Much, much farther. It's so far that it will take days or weeks to get there."
Her father stopped Tipi as she tried to go to her room.
"Tipi doesn't need to pack for a trip."
"That's not it... Actually, Tipi, your father and mother are going to that place alone."
"Alone...? What about Tipi...?"
Her parents looked at each other.
Tipi sensed something from her parents' sad faces.
Suddenly, tears began to overflow.
"I'm sorry, Tipi, we can't do that."
"The place your mother and I are going is very dangerous. We don't want to take you to such a dangerous place, Tipi. Because your mother and father love you very much."
"No... I don't want to... I don't want to! Tipi's going too..."
Her parents gently hugged Tipi.
"I'm sorry, Tipi... But your mother and I have to go."
"I'm sorry, Tipi... It's okay, we'll be back soon."
"We'll be back very soon... So you won't be lonely, we'll come back right away..."
"Tipi, be a good girl and stay home. And show us your drawings again."
"Ah, that's right. Draw one picture every day. What you saw, what you heard, what you learned, what you felt. When we get back, will you tell us about it?"
"That's right. I'll make a lot of stories into books on my trip. I'll come back to tell them to Tipi."
"Yes, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. I promise, so..."
The three family members hugged each other.
To heal that parting, which they didn't know how long would last--.
How much time had passed since then?
Tipi continued to draw, just as her father had told her.
Each time she finished a drawing, she would stick it on the wall. So that her parents would see it as soon as they came home.
What she saw...
What she heard...
What she learned...
What she felt...
But that was soon filled with thoughts of her parents.
I want them to hug me, to pat my head, to call my name, quickly... I want to see them...
Her heart was dyed blue, a deep blue.
The girl continued to draw, tears streaming down her face...
Tipi told me about her sad past, as blue droplets of sorrow flowed.
Her small shoulders were trembling faintly.
A girl enduring sadness right before my eyes.
I can't fathom how great her sorrow is.
Probably because I've never felt such sadness before.
So I can't understand Tipi's feelings.
But I should be able to heal her sorrow.
By holding her small body close.
Surely.
Tipi sat with her back against the wall.
I reach out to her delicate body.
When I touch her shoulder, Tipi's body jumps slightly.
It's not rejection.
She just seems a little surprised by the sudden action in the darkness.
"It's okay, Tipi. It's okay."
"Hey, Rei, you won't disappear from Tipi's life, will you?"
"Yeah, I won't disappear."
"You won't leave Tipi alone?"
"Yeah, I won't leave you alone."
"You won't make Tipi lonely?"
"Yeah, I won't make you lonely."
"You won't make Tipi sad?"
"Yeah, I won't make you sad."
"Will you cherish Tipi?"
"Yeah, I'll cherish you."
"Will you hug Tipi?"
"Yeah, I'll hug you."
"Will you hold Tipi?"
"Yeah, I'll hold you."
"Will you pat Tipi's head?"
"Yeah, I'll pat your head."
"Will you hold hands with Tipi?"
"Yeah, I'll hold your hand."
"Will you stay with Tipi forever?"
Tipi's eyes glimmered faintly in the darkness.
The shoulder I touched held a body temperature that was almost too hot.
I embraced Tipi's body--.
"Oh, you two are getting along well."
The voice that echoed in the darkness didn't belong to a girl trying to heal her sadness.
It was Shiona's, who should have parted ways with me at the entrance.
Before I knew it, Shiona was standing beside me.
With a smile that was still visible even in the dim light, Shiona approached us directly.
"But you know, being too close is also a problem. You're a young man and woman, after all."
Shiona stopped the hand I had extended towards Tipi.
"Y-Yeah..."
Tipi's face twisted in sadness, seeking that arm.
I couldn't help but raise my voice at Shiona.
"Shiona, what are you doing!"
"What's wrong? Why are you so agitated? You have to consider the implications of physical contact with someone of that age."
"That's not it. Tipi is sad... I'm just trying to heal her sadness, even a little."
"Sad? About what?"
"About her parents not coming home yet! Tipi has always been all alone. She's been lonely all this time!"
"That's reality, so it can't be helped."
"Can't be helped? What does that even mean..."
Shiona walked up to Tipi.
And then, she looked at Tipi, who was small and grieving.
"Tipi-chan? It's unfortunate, but Tipi-chan will always be all alone, you know? Always has been, and always will be."
She said that with a smile, in her usual tone.
"Shiona, what are you saying..."
"Tipi-chan knows it too, right? Your mom and dad aren't coming back, are they?"
"Shiona... stop... stop saying such cruel things..."
"You've already realized it, haven't you? You just don't want to admit it."
"...No... no... I don't want to..."
"Tipi-chan's mom and dad..."
"...Shiona... stop..."
"Are already de──"
"Stop ittttttt!!"
My voice echoed through the library.
My whole body was hot.
My breathing became ragged, and I felt a pain deep in my head.
My clenched teeth were also grinding.
My vision flickered, and I could barely stand.
And at the same time, I was certain.
My chest felt red and prickly. The emotion that Mad always had.
This is the emotion called 'anger'.
I'm feeling anger at the injustice happening before my eyes.
Right now, the blue girl's hope has been severed.
With Shiona's heartless words, Tipi was hurt.
Tipi is crying with a voiceless voice.
Her face is all crumpled up.
Turning her sadness into large droplets, letting them flow down her cheeks.
With her young body, she desperately tells the story of her bottomless sorrow.
Shiona added insult to injury.
"Because it's true, right? How long do you think it's been since Tipi-chan's mom and dad came home?"
"Tipi-chan, you draw pictures every day, right? How many is it now?"
"Stop it..."
"Doesn't it make you sad to draw every day? How many more pictures do you have to draw before your mom and dad come back?"
"St, op it..."
"It's useless no matter how much you cry. Tears only flow to comfort yourself. Just because they flow doesn't mean anything will change."
"...Please stop..."
"That's just self-satisfaction. You're just crying because someone will be nice to you if you cry. That's just running away from reality."
"...St...op it..."
"Let's realize it already. Mom and Dad aren't coming back. Never again. Tipi-chan will never be able to see her mom and dad again."
"Also, let me tell you. Rei is only here because he feels sorry for Tipi-chan. He doesn't have the love that Mom and Dad poured into Tipi-chan. Only pity is tying Rei down here. Tipi-chan, do you understand? You're all alone."
"Stop it――――――"
A roar that echoed.
When that voice echoing off the walls stopped, only Tipi's sobs remained.
Tipi looked up at Shiona with hollow eyes.
I felt like the light she had just a little while ago had disappeared.
"Rei, spoiling and comforting are two different things."
"That's not true... that's not true..."
"Rei, accept reality too. Tipi-chan's parents are no longer in this world."
"That's wrong... that's not true..."
"Then why haven't they contacted her even once? They haven't even sent a single letter to Tipi-chan, who they loved and cherished so much?"
"That's... surely, they're just too busy to find the time to contact her..."
"If they knew the other person was worried, they wouldn't begrudge that time. Especially if it's their beloved child. The fact that they haven't means--"
"Stop it... please stop..."
"--Tipi-chan's mom and dad are already dead."
I froze.
Shiona's tone was as gentle as usual, and her smile was the same as always.
I wish she would have said it in a cold, emotionless voice.
In that abnormal atmosphere, I couldn't continue speaking.
Shiona's face, as she turned to face Tipi again, was smiling.
"Tipi-chan, your only family is your mom and dad. But those two aren't coming back anymore. That's why no matter who you're with, you'll never be truly fulfilled. Even if Rei is with you, you can't become a family. That's an immutable fact. You'll always be alone."
Shiona turned on her heel and headed towards the entrance.
On the way, she glanced back at me just once.
She just kept her gaze fixed on the floor.
"Rei... it's all for your sake."
Shiona left the library, leaving only those words behind.
Silence descended upon the library.
Now, even Tipi's sobs had ceased.
I was furious and exhausted by Shiona's words and actions.
I couldn't even stand up.
But I couldn't leave the girl alone like this.
The girl must be thinking:
That she's all alone in the world.
That she has to live in solitude.
I didn't want her to think that way.
I wanted her to know she wasn't alone.
My feelings for Tipi aren't pity.
It's definitely not pity.
I repeated it over and over again.
As if telling myself, again and again.
I reached out and placed my hand on Tipi's shoulder.
I pulled her delicate shoulders close.
Tipi startled at first, but then settled against my chest.
She pressed her face against me, stifling her sobs.
I stroked her trembling shoulders again and again.
If only I could ease even a little of the sorrow she held in that small body...
I don't know how long we stayed like that.
We sat there, nestled close to each other.
After a while, when I had lost all sense of time.
Tipi got up unsteadily and started walking as if searching for something.
Tipi didn't answer.
It was her sketchbook and crayons.
Tipi came back to me with those two items.
She sat down, leaning her back against my stomach.
Tipi still didn't answer.
Instead, she flipped through the pages of her sketchbook.
Using the fresh page as her canvas, Tipi picked up a crayon.
And without hesitation, she ran the crayon across the paper.
What she drew was a cute, age-appropriate picture.
The first thing she drew was a picture of a blue girl.
There were traces of tears on her cheeks.
Her eyes were tinged with red.
I gently stroked Tipi's head.
Lowering her gaze again, Tipi ran the crayon across the paper.
The next thing she started drawing seemed to be me.
My hand is placed on the girl's head.
It seems to be a scene of me gently stroking her head.
And then--
It was Shiona.
She's watching the girl from a short distance away with a scary look on her face.
That was Shiona as Tipi saw her.
Even from my perspective, Shiona in front of Tipi probably looks like that in a picture.
Why did Shiona do such a thing?
Shiona said it.
That it was all for my sake.
I don't know what that means.
No, I didn't want to know.
I don't understand how making Tipi cry could be for my sake.
Can I be happy by making someone else unhappy?
No, there's no way that could be true.
It shouldn't be allowed to happen.
As if to erase Shiona's words that clung to my ears, I hugged Tipi.
Her voice was faint and about to disappear.
But deep down, I felt a tinge of joy.
I think as I look at the picture.
Maybe this is Tipi's way of avoiding sadness.
It is said that people dream at the end of the day.
It is said that this is to organize the memories of the events of that day.
For Tipi, maybe this is the picture.
The events of that day--
Including the good and the bad, she draws everything in a picture.
By doing so, she organizes her memories and calms her heart.
In fact, Tipi's expression has softened somewhat.
As the painting progresses, her sadness subsides.
As if she were passing her sadness on to the painting.
Tipi, who had stood up, took my hand.
Following her hand, I arrived at a wall covered with paintings.
She said she draws one picture a day.
The number of paintings was enormous.
Tipi pasted the picture she drew today on the very edge.
Another one, Tipi's painting has increased.
The wall full of paintings felt like a diary showing this girl's loneliness.
Tipi must have spent her time alone on this story.
To keep such a sad story to herself all this time...
Thinking that, something welled up from the bottom of my heart.
Looking into those sorrowful eyes, I was unintentionally at a loss for words.
Instead of answering, I embraced Tipi.
After a while, I could hear her quiet breathing.
I looked back and forth between Tipi, who was sleeping in my arms, and the illustrated diary on the wall.
Could it be that this picture book is Tipi's heart itself?
Thinking about such things, I fell asleep.
It's the church where I live.
I'm standing in front of the familiar white, large door.
I pushed open the door with both hands.
The chapel that continues inside is enveloped in surprising silence.
--No, it's not complete silence.
Because the sound of quiet sobbing reached my ears.
I rushed through the chapel.
Then, I came face to face with the person who was sobbing.
It was a person who never stopped smiling.
It was Shiona.
Shiona was crying, her delicate shoulders trembling.
I couldn't hide my surprise at that.
--Why is she crying?
I couldn't understand the reason.
But it's a fact that Shiona is crying in front of me.
Those tears are not fake.
Even so, I couldn't do anything.
...No, that's not true.
There must be something I can do.
I reach out my hand.
My fingertips were reaching for Shiona's eyes.
I don't think I can stop those tears.
But I can wipe away the tears that have already fallen.
I'm just someone who can only do that, but--.
I extend my fingertip towards a large drop.
Halfway there, my hand stopped.
My fingertips are made of machine.
The extended index finger had a metallic sheen...
That's right.
I had forgotten.
No, I wanted to forget.
I am not human.
I am an artificial being.
Why is this happening?
Am I not even allowed to wipe away the tears of someone I care about?
Shiona is crying.
She continues to shed tears.
Is this a sadness that Shiona has never shown before?
But I can't stop or wipe away those endlessly flowing tears.
Then why am I here?
Being here, what can I do for Shiona?
I couldn't find the answer.
I couldn't move my outstretched mechanical hand any further...
--Immediately after, a discordant sound of metal scraping against metal echoed around us.
The ear-splitting sound echoed intermittently.
And then, my outstretched fingertip--.
The parts crumbled and fell to the floor.
The collapse, which started from the fingertip, increased its range to the palm--wrist--arm--shoulder.
Parts from all over my body are falling apart.
Before long, it became difficult for me to even stand there, and I fell to the floor.
My legs, my torso, are turning into scrap.
Scrap metal is piling up around me.
Unable to even speak, I had no choice but to accept the collapse.
Shiona is still crying.
Crying, trying to stifle her voice.
I can no longer even extend my mechanical hand.
Because there's no longer even an arm or fingertip there.
The collapse corrodes my entire body, reaching even my head.
I don't feel any pain.
I shouldn't feel any.
But...
I felt a pain deep within my chest, a place that should no longer exist.
The last thing I saw as my vision crumbled was Shiona's sad expression and tears.
Eventually, I became just metal--.
A mountain of scrap.
--And then, I awaken.
I was shouting something, but I don't remember.
My breathing is ragged.
I hurriedly look around.
A dimly lit, dusty space.
The lukewarm air sticks to me unpleasantly.
And thick books lined up on shelves.
This was the library.
It seems I fell asleep yesterday and woke up this morning.
I hurriedly took off my gloves and checked my right hand.
The one that should have collapsed just now was still there as always.
But, just like in the dream, it's made of machine.
On my lap, Tippy was already fast asleep.
Her innocent sleeping face doesn't betray the sadness of yesterday.
It seems I was having what humans call a dream.
During sleep mode, past records can be glimpsed in order to organize the memory area.
But what I just saw was probably something like a prediction based on experience and memory.
Does this mean that this kind of possibility is hidden in the future... that's what was calculated?
Even so, how sad.
I still couldn't calm the turmoil deep within my chest.
Why do Shiona's tears shake me up so much?
And why am I so powerless?
I'm not real.
I knew that.
I thought I knew it.
But even so, I want to make them smile.
I want to make Shiona, Tippy, and everyone in town smile.
But, I can't do it.
I have an idea why, but I don't want to admit it.
--It's because I'm a fake.
The one truth I can't resist, no matter what.
But, even so, I was hoping.
I want to make everyone around me smile.
But, I can't make it happen.
When I try to make Tippy smile, Shiona won't smile.
When I try to make Shiona smile, I can't wipe away Tippy's tears.
How difficult.
Isn't there a way to make everyone smile better?
While looking at Tippy's sad sleeping face, I repeated it over and over in my heart.
I stroke Tippy's head with my fingertips.
The smooth hair lets my fingertips pass through to the ends without getting tangled.
A sweet scent spreads.
"Unn... unnn..."
Is she dreaming? Tippy let out a small voice.
Looking at her innocent sleeping face, my desire to protect her grows stronger.
But, how?
Alternately looking at my mechanical right hand and Tippy's face, I was at a loss.
I wished that this gentle time could last forever.
--But, it couldn't be.
A strange sound echoed from afar.
Footsteps echoed, as if many people were walking at the exact same time.
And, faintly, the sound of screams and something being destroyed.
Those two sounds crushed even my small hope.
I hurriedly put on my glove on my right hand.
"W-What... Rei, what is it...?"
Tippy woke up to the abnormality.
An anxious expression that wasn't there before spread across Tippy's face.
"I don't know... but, it seems like something happened."
"Something? What is something?"
"I have no idea. But, I'm sure it's not a good situation."
I stood up and pointed my toes towards the library aisle.
"...Rei? Where are you going?"
"I'm just going to check things out."
"No... don't go, Rei."
"It's okay, I'm not going anywhere. I'm just going to check things out on the roof for a little while."
"No... I don't want you to go..."
Tippy hugged me and shed tears.
She must be superimposing my vanished parents onto me.
"It's okay. It's okay, Tippy."
"N-No... no..."
"Have I ever broken a promise with you, Tippy?"
"That's, that's right. When you said you'd go see them, you always did, right?"
"So it's okay. I'll look from the roof and come right back."
"...Okay. But, come back quickly, okay?"
"Yeah, of course."
I made a promise with Tippy and headed to the library rooftop.
What I reached after climbing the long spiral staircase was an old, rusted door.
There were no signs of it being used for a long time.
When I opened it, a grating, unpleasant sound echoed in my ears.
Without concern, I pushed the door open.
...At the same time as that.
An anomaly jumped into my eyes.
Black smoke was rising from all over town.
The scream-like sounds were not a mishearing; they were coming from the mouths of the townspeople fleeing from something.
And chasing after those townspeople were multiple shadowy figures clad in soiled cloaks.
Silently, they just walked while holding firearms──yet, with efficient coordination, they were surely cornering the fleeing people.
It was as if everything was calculated, such movements.
The townspeople cornered against the wall and the attackers were exchanging words.
The attackers glanced at each other and nodded, then pointed the muzzle of their guns at the townspeople's heads.
And without showing the slightest hesitation, they pulled the finger they had on the trigger.
──Along with a dry sound, the head shook violently as if it burst, and the townspeople collapsed on the spot...…
The sound snapped me back to reality, and I understood the situation.
It's hard to believe... but it seems this town is under attack.
What Shiona was saying was true...…
I rushed back to the lobby in a panic.
Seeing me like that, Tippy asked anxiously.
"Ray... did something happen? You have a really scary look on your face."
"...I don't really know... but... something bad is happening..."
Unable to tell Tippy directly what I had seen, I spoke vaguely.
"Something bad? What do you mean?"
"This town is being attacked... I think."
"No... Tippy's scared..."
"It's okay, it's far away from town. It should still be safe here, so calm down."
"...Okay... but, what are we going to do?"
"I'm going to go and see what's happening..."
I was worried about the town, but I was even more worried about Shiona.
Even though that happened yesterday, she's still a person who helped me.
I haven't even asked why Shiona, who is kind to everyone, is so harsh only to Tippy.
I still don't understand the meaning of her words that it was for my sake.
"No, don't go... please... Ray..."
"It's okay, Tippy. I'll definitely come back."
"Really? Really, really?"
"Yeah, of course. So, can you wait for me just a little bit?"
"If you come back, Tippy will wait."
Tippy hugged her bear tightly.
Even so, the anxiety could not be erased from her expression.
Is there nothing I can do about this girl's sadness and anxiety?
Leaving the library with such a guilty feeling in my heart, I left the library.
I decided to use back roads as much as possible on the way to town.
What's happening in town is clearly not good.
There is a risk that I might suffer some damage if I am found.
I try to silence my footsteps as much as possible as I head to the square.
I wanted to arrive before the squad if possible, but it seemed impossible because I kept taking detours.
The closer I got to the center of town, the more broken buildings I noticed.
But those were all buildings that didn't seem like they were about to break until yesterday.
Were they destroyed by those strangers who were chasing the townspeople?
Dust hangs in the town that was so beautiful until yesterday.
Why would they need to destroy the buildings in this peaceful town?
I just can't understand it.
Amidst the screams and the noise of buildings being destroyed, I arrived at the truth.
--The tragedy unfolding in the plaza.
Many men were chasing and capturing the townspeople.
Pointing guns, using unreasonable violence as a shield, they drove men, women, and even children, indiscriminately.
The captured townspeople are being made to sit in the center of the plaza.
Children crying and screaming. Inarticulate shouts of anger.
The armed men, as if such voices were nothing to them, wore cool expressions.
No, perhaps the expression "cool" is strange.
They had faces that showed no interest whatsoever, like a glance at a stone lying on the roadside.
I can't see Shiona anywhere within my field of vision. I can assume she hasn't been captured yet, right...?
"--What's the situation?"
"--We've captured the majority of the residents. It's only a matter of time before we get the rest."
Nearby, I overheard two men talking.
Careful not to be noticed, I slowly approached the two and eavesdropped.
"How are the water and food supplies?"
"They were sufficiently stocked. As for water, we found an underground water source."
"I see, so it was a greater harvest than expected."
"Yes, it's possible to settle here permanently."
I was certain.
These men are the ones attacking the town and stealing water and food.
I just couldn't forgive their unreasonable actions.
To hurt innocent people for the sake of mere plunder...
But, I couldn't do anything more than that.
I couldn't even jump out from that spot.
I knew better than anyone that I was a powerless being.
"But how did you find such a small town?"
"--There was a slave who escaped the other day, right?"
"If I remember correctly, he was advocating for coexistence with the Phloイド..."
"Yes. A foolish man trapped in the ideas of the old era. Coexistence and harmony with the Phloイド are such useless thoughts in this world."
--Coexistence and harmony...
Those words brought to mind a certain young man.
The one I helped, brought to this town... and whose last words they were before he passed away.
Does that mean these men are the ones who inflicted those injuries on him?
"So, we treated him the same as the Phloイド, and he was a labor force that we kept alive."
"That's right. Chasing after him to bring him back unexpectedly proved useful."
One of the men continued in a monotone voice.
"After all, a human appeared to help that man and guided us to the town."
Hearing those words, I felt a chill run down my spine.
Why didn't I consider the cause of that young man's injuries back then?
I should have known from Shion that there was a group carrying out looting...
Even when returning to town, if I had paid more attention to my surroundings, I might have avoided being followed.
I regret taking such reckless action on a momentary impulse.
I'm the one who created the cause of this attack──……it's me.
"We've finished gathering the town's key people in one place. There are zero resisters."
"I see. Then, select those who are orally ingestible and lack production or management skills from among them. Factors that reduce productivity are──"
As he said that, the man receiving the report pulled a pistol from his pocket.
"Dispose of them."
"--Stop!"
At the same moment I understood the meaning of those words, I screamed.
However, I couldn't help but scream at these humans who so casually said 'dispose' of the townspeople who had taken care of me.
At that, the men who were there turned around.
And, our eyes met.
"Secure him."
With that voice, the men rushed towards me.
In a panic, I started running.
But, my body couldn't keep up with my feelings.
My legs wouldn't move properly, and I ended up running away while losing my balance.
Immediately, the men were closing in behind me.
Their movements are mechanically precise.
Damn, at this rate I'll be caught.
It's now or never, I fled into the back alley.
The back alley had several muddy spots due to the rain.
While my feet were being caught, I kept running.
Occasionally, I knocked over lumber leaning against the wall, trying to slow the men down.
But that level of interference wasn't even enough to slow them down.
I could tell the men were closing in right behind me.
Can I really escape like this...?
What I was aiming for was the library.
Even if I managed to escape to the library, Tippy's existence would be revealed to them.
If Tippy were to be attacked──.
I changed the direction of my toes.
I fled into what seemed to be the back door of the nearest building.
Coincidentally, it was Mad's general store.
I searched for a place to hide──.
"! ?"
I found a figure sitting in a chair.
Mad didn't answer. Just like that day after turning the projector, he sat shallowly in the chair with his arms crossed.
"Mad, you can hear me, right!? Stop joking around at a time like this, Mad──Mad?"
I swallowed my scream just in time.
The moment I touched Mad's shoulder, Mad──quietly collapsed from the chair. As if he were already dead.
Wh-Why--!
Did those men 'dispose' of him? But, there aren't any external wounds.
Target acquired.
What snapped me out of my near panic was, ironically, the voices of the men who had been chasing me.
However, it was far too late.
We have enough manpower as it is, eliminate him.
Unable to do anything, I just frantically jumped back from Mad, the men stepped in, and the lead man aimed his gun at me──
Ray!
Immediately after, several things happened at once.
A dry sound rang out, the sound of a gunshot.
And, a figure slid in front of me as if to protect me──.
Shio──
It took me a moment to grasp the situation.
That person was standing there, as if to protect me.
That person turned only their face to look at me.
With the same unchanging smile, that person looked at me.
And, a few seconds later──.
Shionaaaaaa!
My mind blank, I scream.
Seeing her like that, my body started moving without thinking.
With the mechanical arm hidden beneath my glove, I punched down one of the shelves. That caused a chain reaction, toppling shelves all over the store──scattering fine fragments and even finer dust everywhere.
At the same time, I picked up a can that had fallen on the floor and threw it with all my might at the window.
The men reacted to the sound of the window glass shattering.
Did he escape through the window?
Let's chase him.
The men jumped out the still-open door and outside.
They're gone--
And as for me, I was crouching still right next to the fallen shelf, half my body sunk into the floor that had been knocked out by the impact.
Hugging Shiona in my arms so that the shelves and fragments wouldn't hit her.
Shiona, Shiona, hang in there!
I desperately shake Shiona, whose eyes are closed.
It seems she's lost consciousness.
I run my eyes over Shiona's body, but I can't find any wounds.
Could the bullet have missed? But, since she's unconscious, I can't say she's safe.
In any case, I have to evacuate first.
──Nearby, a place where I can do that is...
I take a deep breath and remember.
The girl I left waiting in the library.
I took the back streets to return to the library, trying not to be seen by the humans.
Carrying Shiona on my back was a considerable handicap, but I went through the destroyed buildings again and again as if crawling through them.
During that time, Shiona didn't move at all. That helped when carrying her, but at the same time, my anxiety increased.
If something happened to Shiona... While feeling crushed by that fear, I arrived at the library.
The clouds covering the sky were darkening their hue even further.
Having finally reached the library, I began searching for Tippy.
Is Tippy alright?
For now, there are no signs of the library having been ransacked.
There's no sign that anyone has entered.
Passing through the entrance, the inside of the library was silent.
Feeling relieved, I weaved between the shelves, searching for Tippy.
But no matter how much I searched, I couldn't find Tippy.
Could it be--.
Trying to dispel the unpleasant thought, I desperately searched the area.
Could it be--.
Relying on hope, I headed to the lobby.
I went around to the back of it.
There, I found Tippy, covering her ears and eyes and trembling slightly.
I reached out my hand to that small body.
Tippy, I'm back.
Tippy's shoulders twitched slightly.
But when she recognized me, she hugged me with the force of a jump.
"Welcome back. I believed in you, Rei."
She pressed large tears against my chest.
Her body was trembling slightly.
Ah, I had made this child feel uneasy again.
I put my hand around her back and stroked it.
"It's okay... I won't leave you again."
Perhaps relieved by those words, Tippy's trembling lessened and eventually stopped.
"What happened? What's wrong with Shiona?"
Tippy stared at Shiona, who still had her eyes closed, and asked anxiously.
I told her the truth without hiding anything.
"She was shot. To protect me... She doesn't seem to be injured, but she lost consciousness..."
"Show me immediately!"
With unprecedented agility, Tippy took Shiona in her arms and laid her down on the floor.
"Rei, turn around, I'm going to look at Shiona's wounds."
"Ah, okay... Wait, is Shiona injured!?"
"I don't know. But I'm going to check."
Seeing Tippy's hand on Shiona's clothes, I hurriedly turned around.
Shortly after--
"...It's okay, there were no problems... Rei."
Tippy's tone had returned to normal.
I quietly turned around.
Shiona was breathing peacefully on the lobby floor where she was lying.
I thought she had been shot protecting me, but it seems she just lost consciousness from the close-range gunshot.
"That's good..."
I let out a sigh of relief from the bottom of my heart.
"Rei, why was Shiona shot?"
"Humans came. And they're starting to loot this town. Destroying buildings and--"
I didn't mention that they were trying to 'dispose' of the townspeople, or that Mad-san might have already been 'taken care of'.
"And when I was found and about to be shot, Shiona protected me--"
I clenched my fist tightly without thinking. Tippy looked sadly at me like that,
"--I see. But if that's the case... this place might be dangerous too."
She answered with a serious face.
"I wonder if we can get through this by hiding... somehow until the humans leave..."
As if to stop my words, Tippy sadly shook her head.
"The humans have found this town. A town for them to live in. So, they'll come here too."
"No way... are those guys going to settle down here...?"
"Because this is a 'town'."
A town... That's right.
I walked through barren lands before I reached this place.
I had no food or water, and was constantly facing death.
Those humans must have traveled through such a world too.
If that's the case, this "town" is a paradise they never wished for.
"But... even so, why do they do things like stealing? The people of this town would have accepted them."
"It's for them to live."
"It's wrong to think that anything is okay for that reason... that it's okay to sacrifice someone!"
"...Rei, scary..."
"Ah, sorry, I didn't mean to scare Tippy..."
I released the fist I had clenched in anger and stroked Tippy's head to reassure her.
Let's think about Tippy and Shiona for now.
If we stay in town like this, these two will be in danger too.
I really want to help everyone in town. But, it's impossible for me now. I don't have the power or wisdom.
I'll freeze the emotions that Shiona and the townspeople taught me, and mechanically... make the most efficient choice.
Let's go somewhere we can settle down for a while.
"Tippy, let's leave town for now. And let's think about how to help the people in town."
As I said that, my chest tightened.
That's because I put a rank on life.
I chose the lives in front of me, within reach.
That must be a shameful thing. The weight of life is equal, but... even so, I'm trying to choose...
"Yeah, I think that's a good idea."
The little girl's nod lightens my sense of guilt.
"Let's hide in that abandoned factory for now. There shouldn't be anything there that humans would want."
"Then, I have to prepare food for Rei and Shiona..."
"That's right. I wish we could somehow stop by the church."
The library where we are now and the church are on opposite sides of the plaza, at opposite ends of town.
Even if we leave town and make a big detour, we'll be sitting ducks if they snipe at us from a place with no cover. On top of that, I'll be carrying Shiona on my back.
So, does that mean we have no choice but to proceed while crawling under the rubble again? It'll be even more difficult this time since Tippy's with us...
I explained that to Tippy as clearly as possible.
"Is it hard to go to the church?"
"Yeah... for now."
"Then, you should go under!"
"...Under?"
"Yeah, under. Go under the ground to the church."
"Yeah, underground. If it's underground, no one will find you."
"Underground... underground, huh... but how?"
"You can go inside through a manhole and then go under the town."
...I see.
Certainly, if we do that, we can go to the church without being seen by anyone.
"That's a good idea, Tippy! You're amazing, Tippy!"
"Ehehe... Rei praised me."
"But, where are the manholes located in town?"
"Hmm... Rei, come here."
Tippy takes my hand and leads me to the bookshelf.
Without the slightest hesitation, she came to a certain bookshelf.
"That book."
I take the book Tippy is pointing at and open it.
Inside, there was a map of the town's manhole locations and its underground waterways.
"That's amazing, Tippy! If we have this, we can get to the church without any problems."
"Thank you... Rei."
Tippy narrows her eyes and rejoices as I stroke her head.
"Alright, Tippy. Let's get going right away."
"Okay... but wait. I'll get ready, so just a little bit--wait?"
"Yeah, sure."
"Thank you, Rei."
Tippy bows quickly and disappears into the back room.
Tippy said that she was fine, but I'm still worried that she hasn't regained consciousness.
The humans didn't shoot her with a gun that fires bullets, but with a weapon that takes away freedom of movement.
If I know the cause, I'll know how to deal with it.
Is an unknown situation really this terrifying?
"Rei, sorry to keep you waiting. --What's wrong?"
Tippy came back from the back room.
"No, it's nothing. I was just a little worried about Shiona."
I answered, trying to appear as calm as possible.
"So, what are you taking with you?"
Tippy, who said she had prepared, was carrying a large bag.
"A stuffed animal and... a picture book and... crayons."
"I see. They're important to you, aren't they?"
"And... a picture of Papa and Mama."
Tippy says sadly.
A picture of her parents who will probably never return.
I don't know how Tippy feels as she stares at the picture.
"Um, then what's this?"
Apart from the large bag, Tippy was carrying a thin but sturdy metal bag in her hand. It seems a little too rugged for small Tippy to carry.
"This is... I'll tell you later. More importantly, Rei, let's go."
"Ah, okay..."
With Tippy's help, I carry Shiona, who is lying on the floor, on my back. Strangely, I couldn't feel the weight.
"I'm ready, Tippy."
"Okay, then... goodbye."
Tippy said goodbye to the countless bookshelves.
Her voice sounded somewhat sad.
I still haven't been able to heal this girl's sadness at all.
But I haven't given up.
We'll be together from now on.
Even if it's just little by little, as we spend time together.
I want to heal Tippy's sadness.
And someday, I want to see Tippy with a heartfelt smile on her face.
That was my secret wish right now.
"Now, let's go."
"--Yeah."
Without uttering a single complaint, Tippy followed me.
By the time we reached the church, we were quite exhausted.
There were no signs of humans around.
We cautiously looked around and stepped into the church.
The chapel was silent.
It was a silence that made the town's commotion seem like a lie.
I found a music box on the altar at the back of the chapel.
Was this where Shiona listened to its melody?
The sound of my footsteps echoed loudly in the chapel as I headed towards the music box.
I approached the altar and reached for the music box.
As I turned the handle, a melody poured out from within.
The melody warmed the depths of my heart somehow.
--Suddenly, I heard a singing voice.
It came from behind me.
"Welcome back,"
Shiona said, getting off my back.
"That's not important. Are you hurt anywhere? Tippy said you were okay, but..."
"Yeah, I seem to be fine."
Shiona smiled to reassure me. Then, she looked at Tippy, who was next to her.
"Tippy-chan... you came too, huh?"
"Yeah--"
Tippy nodded, looking as sad as ever--yet with a look of resolve on her face.
"Shiona..."
Tippy held out her palm towards Shiona, stopping her words.
"I understand... I understand, but!"
Shiona looked down, as if enduring something.
"--Shiona."
In response, Tippy was gentle as ever...
Those were such unexpected words. Shiona gasped and stared into Tippy's small eyes.
"I realized it while being with Rei. What Shiona is trying to do."
"But, if that's the case--"
"That's also why I came here. The library is impossible now... Probably this town too."
"Tippy-chan, I'm sorry..."
"It's okay. Shiona doesn't need to cry, it's alright."
Kneeling down, Shiona jumped into Tippy's arms, and Tippy gently embraced her, saying that.
It was as if Tippy was the older sister, giving me such an illusion.
"Rei, what are you going to do now?"
Tippy's words startled me back to reality.
"If Shiona seems okay, I want to help the people of the town. Especially those who were said to be disposed of--"
"Disposed of?"
"Yeah..."
It was a terrible way of putting it... Speaking as if they didn't see fellow humans as humans.
"Can Rei do it?"
"I don't know, but... even so, I can't just stand by and watch someone about to be killed right in front of me."
"But, Rei will be in danger."
"Yeah, I know that..."
They're the kind of guys who'll point a gun at you without a second thought. There's no way I can win by confronting them head-on.
I'm sure even trying to talk to them will be impossible.
"I promise. If it gets even a little dangerous, I'll definitely turn back."
"Absolutely. If Rei gets hurt--everything will be irreversible."
"Yeah. I can't just leave Shiona behind either."
"Rei..."
"Shiona--"
With that one word, we separated as if magnets repelled each other.
"S-Sorry! It's not like I forgot about Tippy-chan!"
"Only Shiona, that's not fair..."
Tippy said, pouting her lips just a little.
"I'm sorry, Tippy. I didn't mean it that way..."
I apologized while gently stroking Tippy's head.
"Muu... That's not it..."
Even so, Tippy's expression wasn't entirely displeased.
Seeing that, Shiona laughed first--followed by me and Tippy, who also smiled.
And so, we laughed together.
Without a word, the three of us held hands.
Grasping each other's hands tightly, as if never to let go again.
And before that resolve could waver, I declared.
"From now on, let's always be together, the three of us. Always--"
But, as if mocking me...
In the distance, footsteps echoed.
Shiona's smile, Tippy's smile, stiffened.
I must be stiffening up too.
Everyone in town has been captured.
Then, the one heading towards this church now is--
Without a doubt, it's a human.
I was the first to move. I looked outside the window, making sure not to make a sound.
There's one person. However, I don't know how many more are coming behind.
"Shiona, Tippy, go to the back of the chapel. Crouch down as much as possible, so you can't be seen from the outside."
"Okay, but shouldn't we lock the door first?"
"That's no good. If we do that, they'll definitely call for backup. If that happens, we won't stand a chance."
I want to neutralize the human outside without making as much noise as possible.
If it's just one person, I think I can manage. If it's two, we can somehow manage with a surprise attack.
But, if there are three or more--I haven't told Shiona or Tippy, but I was prepared to be captured alone.
I muffled my footsteps and stood in the shadow of the door. In the meantime, the footsteps are getting closer and closer.
The number is one. For now, there's no one following behind.
"...Sigh..."
I quietly took a deep breath and steeled myself.
I held my breath. The footsteps are--right nearby.
The door slowly opened.
Then a man with a pistol slowly enters.
--Now!
In that instant, I swung my arm down with all my might from his blind spot.
Immediately, I kicked away the pistol that fell to the floor.
At the same time, I tried to sweep his legs, but as expected, he dodged it.
We're still at a distance where we're almost touching.
It's safe to assume he has weapons other than a gun.
If so, I can catch him off guard by pouncing on him the moment he reaches for it.
But the man quietly tilted his head and looked at me.
"What do you intend to do, you?"
He asked in a voice devoid of intonation.
"Why are you hostile to us? Are you the owner of this town?"
"Owner? I just want to do what's best for the people of this town."
"That's quite the Philoid-like thing to say."
"...So what if it is...? That's my reason for existing."
As I said that, I took off the glove on my right hand and showed off my mechanical hand.
It's not a good idea to fight me head-on with my mechanical body.
If I can make him think that, he might back down.
Right now, all that matters is ensuring the safety of Shiona and Tippy. Even if my true identity is revealed to them, I'll protect what I want to protect.
That is my role as a Philoid.
The man tilted his head again at my actions.
"What are you talking about? Philoids cannot engage in any combat actions. They are made to obey orders, so they cannot defy humans."
"Huh?"
"In any case, you are an incompatible person trapped in the ideology of the old era. I will eliminate you before you become a source of trouble."
The blade is thrust straight towards my throat.
I grabbed the blade of the knife with my mechanical right hand. Then, I put all my strength into it and twisted it sharply.
With just that, the knife blade snapped off from the base.
I put all my weight on him and pushed him down. I put the elbow of my left arm against his throat and pinned his legs with my knees--
"Rei!"
Shiona jumped out from the back of the room.
I pressed down on the man's throat with my left hand, and said, while raising my bare metal right hand.
It's a metal arm that can break a knife. If I swing it down on his head with all my might, he won't be unscathed.
"Rei, stop!"
Shiona pleaded in a trembling voice.
--But.
While grinding my teeth, I put all my strength into it--and swung down my right hand.
My right hand was half-buried.
Not in the man's head, but in the floor right next to it.
"Why spare me? If you consider your own safety, killing me is the right choice."
The man said that, still expressionless.
"That's not true. Killing is the wrong choice, no matter the reason."
"Incorrigible. Such an inefficient way of thinking."
"I'm going to take you hostage. And make them release the people of the town."
I grabbed the other party's collar and pulled him up.
"That's meaningless. My life is not worth that much. If my death now opens up the future for my comrades, there is no reason to regret it."
Without changing his tone at all, the man took something out of his pocket.
It was an old-fashioned bomb. At the same time as pulling out the safety pin, he grabbed my arm.
"What!"
I pulled my arm back reflexively, but it didn't budge.
I shuddered.
Why doesn't this human show any emotion on his face, even at this moment when he's about to throw away his life?
I felt as if my body was bound by the color of his eyes, which seemed to lack any will.
--No good! If I let my thoughts stop, it's over!
I instantly switched gears and started analyzing the situation.
What the man is holding is a really small bomb, about the size of a small fruit.
But, since it's a bomb, it will have lethal force, and more than anything, the blast could alert the humans staying in the town.
When, when will it explode?
The other party intends to self-destruct. It's certain that there isn't much time.
But, what should I do? If the scale of the explosion is large, Shiona and the others who are hiding will also be affected.
It's impossible to neutralize this bomb, so what's the best way to minimize its effect?
I reflexively hugged the man. In a way that sandwiches the bomb.
This way, I might at least be able to protect Shiona and the others from the blast. It might be imperfect, but it's the best choice I can think of.
If only I can save these two──
The next moment, the impact came.
From the side. Like being shoved away... no, I was shoved away!
While rolling on the floor, I looked at the place where I was before.
There, was Shiona, holding the bomb.
"Shiona!"
"Get down!"
The bomb she was clutching burst with a strong light and sound.
Perhaps the scale of the explosion wasn't that large because it was a type of bomb not intended for killing.
Even so, I, who was at point-blank range, took the full force of the blast and sound and felt dizzy.
The human, who was also at point-blank range, has also lost consciousness.
"Shiona!"
In my vision that was swaying dizzily, I shouted.
Please, please be safe.
"Shiona!?"
"...Rei..."
"Shio...na..."
"Shiona, we need to treat you immediately!"
The distance of a few steps felt incredibly long.
While slapping my wobbly legs, I approached Shiona.
There, I saw it.
"What... is this..."
I was speechless at the sight of Shiona.
Her right arm, thrown onto the floor... from the wrist onward... a metallic frame?
Not bone. Absolutely not. It's clearly different from that of a human.
And--it's gone.
That's strange.
Something that should be there, isn't.
Red.
That is the proof of a human.
"Wh... wh... why?"
"B-but..."
I clench my mechanical right hand, covered by a glove.
That's right, if we were the same... if only we were the same....
"Shiona, are you... okay?"
"Yeah, I'm fine with this much."
There's no way that's true.
There's no way that could be true.
She took the explosion at such close range.
There's no way she could be okay.
It must be so painful that she can't help but shed tears.
And yet.
And yet, why?
"More than me... Rei, your head."
I followed Shiona's gaze and touched my head.
--Ah, why is this?
Why is it that something Shiona needs is with me?
I don't need this.
I don't need this, so I wish Shiona had it.
No, she should have had it.
Shiona touches my head and says.
"You're bleeding, are you okay?"
Blood was flowing from my head.
Red.
Red blood.
Something that doesn't flow in a Phloid...
In contrast, not a single drop of blood flowed from Shiona's arm.
Instead, the exposed mechanical parts are visible.
What this means is only one thing.
That is--
"...Rei? There was a loud noise, are you okay--Shiona!? Rei!?"
Tipi, who came out from the back, screamed.
With an anxious expression, her eyes are filled with tears.
"You both have to heal your injuries...!".
"It's okay... I'm okay..."
I gently embrace Tipi, who was about to panic.
Embraced, Tipi showed a slightly relieved expression in my chest.
But it is an unstable thing.
It looks like it's about to collapse at any moment, and it hurts deep inside my chest to see it.
"Rei... let's move, we can't stay here anymore..."
Tipi says in a trembling voice. Shiona nods in agreement.
Certainly, with the explosion just now, other humans will definitely come.
There were many things I wanted to ask.
There were many things I wanted to confirm.
But, I swallow it for now.
"...Let's go, let's leave the town."
We left the church with only the bare minimum of luggage.
Then, following Tipi's instructions, we used the back streets of the town to escape outside, and headed for the abandoned factory.
I am reminded of it there too...
The heavy footsteps from fatigue... were only mine.
Led by Tipi and pulled by Shiona, I continue walking.
Reaching the abandoned factory, I finally sat down on the ground.
Next to Shiona, who has a cool face, I regulate my rough breathing.
"Tipi, I'll go get some water."
The little girl glanced at Shiona and then disappeared into the back of the abandoned factory.
She probably entrusted all the explanations to Shiona.
"...Shiona"
At my voice, Shiona returns a slightly troubled smile.
"I think you've already noticed, but I am... no. Everyone living in this town is a Filoid."
That was... what I was trying to avoid.
I had a premonition... I felt something was off... but it was something I didn't want to admit...
"So... I'm a 'human'?"
When my head was damaged, a red liquid leaked from the damaged area.
It closely resembled the 'blood' flowing in the human body.
Filoids don't have such a liquid, so it shouldn't flow.
"You've been misunderstanding because you have a mechanical arm... it's an artificial medical part to compensate for limbs lost in an accident or something."
"So... then I really am..."
"Yes, you are a human. Our Filoid creator and partner. That's who you are. Everyone in town is a Filoid. Only you were human."
"I see..."
I stare at my mechanical right hand covered in a glove and weakly clench it.
The existence I thought I had was the complete opposite....
Shiona is a Filoid... and I am a human....
--In other words, I am a human, the very existence I should hate.
I felt something deep inside my chest.
That feeling was painful.
Sad.
And infuriating.
I was the same existence as those cold-hearted, merciless beings I could only see as evil.
My chest ached unbearably.
I felt anger at the unchangeable truth.
What the man I was dealing with earlier was saying was right.
I wasn't a Filoid, but a human.
And those humans, the rulers, are trying to do terrible things to the townspeople, the Filoids they dominate--no, they probably already are.
How did things end up like this?
I just wanted to live together with Shiona and the townspeople.
I just wanted to make everyone happy.
But, but, but--.
I can't do that.
Because I'm a human.
Because I'm one of those hopeless creatures.
I felt warmth in my fist, which I had unconsciously clenched.
When I lowered my gaze, I saw Shiona's hand placed over mine.
That warmth is artificial.
But, that didn't matter to me.
…It's warm.
That alone was enough to ease the emotions that were weighing on my heart.
But at the same time, it highlighted my own inadequacy.
Do I even deserve her kindness?
"Do you want to know more? About you all?"
Shiona said to me with a smile.
"By 'you all', do you mean humans?"
"Yes, humans. Do you want to know about our partners?"
If I can learn about it, I want to know.
So I nodded.
"I want to know… I want to know why we ended up like this."
"Ray, do you remember the picture of Tippy-chan in the library?"
"Ah, I remember it…"
"That picture, Tippy-chan draws it every day. Every single day, no matter what, one picture a day."
I closed my eyelids and recalled that scene.
There were dozens, hundreds of those pictures drawn with crayons.
"How many do you think there are?"
"I don't know... If Tippy is also a Philoid, she's probably been drawing for years... Maybe around a thousand."
"Eighty-six thousand six hundred and seventy-one."
"Eighty-six thou--"
Once again, a strong dizziness attacked me. But it wasn't from the explosion earlier, or the subsequent bleeding.
For such a long time, Tippy had been spending her days alone in that dark library.
Hardly anyone ever came to that library.
It must have been a lonely existence.
Just thinking about the time Tippy spent there filled me with a terror that felt like the ground was disappearing beneath my feet.
Tippy had endured all of that.
With that small body of hers.
"From there, several decades prior, we Philoids were born. Desired by humans--"
Shiona told me the history of the Philoids as if singing a song.
First, Philoids were androids that had reached the practical stage, equipped with human emotions.
Basic emotional information was installed from the beginning, and a system was adopted that allowed them to learn new emotions through self-sufficient thinking circuits.
Including that, it can be said that they are as close to humans as possible.
Therefore, they were able to become as close to humans as possible, not only in work but also in life.
Eventually, companies appeared that installed custom-made emotions and memories, and an unprecedented Philoid boom arrived.
Families who could not have children purchased child Philoids, and those who had lost parents or children ordered Philoids with their memories.
The number of Philoids increased in the blink of an eye, and in just over a decade, the number produced was comparable to the human population.
Among them, the most revolutionary was the Philoid equipped with 'love,' the most complex emotion of humans.
It had the ability to serve as a companion for life.
You could obtain a loved one without going through the process of romance, and that love was guaranteed semi-permanently.
In a society where late marriages were progressing and more humans were prioritizing work over romance, the demand was great and it was received with applause.
However, no children were born into families who married Philoids, accelerating the declining birthrate.
And the declining birthrate created a shortage of marriage partners, creating a loop in which more and more Philoids entered into marital relationships.
"And, before they knew it, humans forgot how to nurture love."
Shiona laughed sadly.
"Human children began to be created artificially using science. But humans who had lost love could not teach the children who were born about love."
Love was the origin of all emotions.
Because there is love, you feel the joy of connecting with someone.
Because there is love, you know what you want to protect and feel anger when it is hurt.
Because there is love, you feel sadness when you lose something important.
Because there is love... you share, divide, and know the joy of sharing the same emotions.
But──……, they forgot that.
The humans who came to town are probably those kinds of "humans."
Humans who have forgotten "emotion" along with love have even lost the ability to care for others.
Humans no longer needed love, and the existence of Philoids with emotions became unpleasant.
When considering the efficiency of actions, there was too much waste...
Humans eventually came to believe that Philoids should be machines.
To deliberately put them in harsh environments... to have them do dangerous work... to abuse them beyond their specifications...
However, there were humans who did not approve of this.
The humans who retained the emotion of love appealed, saying that Philoids were partners.
The world was divided in two.
Humans with love, and humans without.
And the humans without love concluded.
That the ideas of the old generation were foolish and should be annihilated...
They didn't even hesitate to press the button for a weapon that would scorch the earth.
After that, everything happened quickly.
It didn't even take five days for retaliation to call for retaliation, and for the world to be enveloped in flames and ash.
A poisoned land of pollution, black clouds blocking the sunlight, a sea that could not nourish life.
The history of humans would come to an end by their own hands...
It was such a foolish choice.
"We, who were born for the sake of humans, ended up taking away what was most important to them."
"That's not true... we humans are to blame for everything..."
"But you know, there were many humans who survived. No matter how tattered the world becomes, life never stops moving forward."
I couldn't find the words to respond to Shiona, who spoke to me so gently.
"...Ahem, ah, ahhh, ah."
Suddenly, Shiona began practicing her voice.
Then, she turned to face my questioning gaze head-on──
"Nice to meet you. I am the MODA-117 Alice mk-17, manufactured by Asou International. Have you completed user registration? If you have registered, please decide on my individual name. It's the first name given to me. Please choose it carefully!"
――I was caught off guard.
It would be easy to just say I'd never seen that before... but it was the first time I'd seen Shiona so utterly cheerful and innocent.
"Surprised?"
Shiona asked, back to her usual self.
"Y-yeah..."
"That's the oldest memory I have."
I wonder when that was. I can't even imagine.
"Back then, every day was like a festival... it was so lively."
Saying that, Shiona showed me a piece of paper that looked like a newspaper clipping.
'World-renowned Musician Passes Away'
The photo on it was the same one that was in the photo frame in Shiona's room.
He had a face similar to mine.
"Is this... your brother?"
"Yes, this story is also quite old... You see, I'm the latest model among the Philoids that were manufactured. Fifth generation, I think."
I wonder how Shiona feels about describing herself as 'manufactured.'
Philoids have emotions just like humans.
In other words, they are the same as humans.
Can she really be so detached about it?
"My generation was the first model to be equipped with the concept of human 'death.' To get as close to humans as possible. But the models before me don't have that... That's the case with Mad and Tippy-chan. Neither of them can understand 'death.' It's useless to explain it. The day they understand will never come."
To continue waiting without knowing death.
It's a hope that exists, but a hope that will never be rewarded.
Despair in the name of hope.
To be confronted with that unconditionally.
If I'm going to be confronted with something like that, wouldn't it be better to have been taught despair from the start?
I thought it would be better that way.
"Tippy-chan is an even earlier model... I think she was a second-generation Philoid. Up until the second generation, they couldn't extract energy from food. That's why she runs on electricity. But there's a limit to how long the battery lasts. She carries that bear plushie as an auxiliary battery."
Come to think of it, Tippy always had that plushie in her hand whenever she moved somewhere.
I had no idea it was a battery.
But that explains a few things.
Like why Tippy was always in that library.
That library has the only power generation system in town.
Tippy was staying in that place in order to continue functioning.
"Tippy-chan's parents also died a long time ago. Probably more than 200 years ago. But Tippy-chan, who has no concept of death, is waiting. Always, all alone."
What a cruel story.
I don't know the lifespan of a Philoid, but Tippy has spent hundreds of years like that.
Every day, shedding tears.
Trapped by a future that will never come──……held captive by an unfulfilled hope.
In that lonely library, all by herself.
It feels like there's a lead ball in the depths of my chest.
It's painful and agonizing.
But the more I think about it, the more it sinks into the depths of me.
But, even knowing that, it's still painful.
And Shiona is aware of death. In other words, she can't even hold onto the hope that we might meet again.
Ray saw Mad collapse at the general store, right?
Yeah... it was strange. It was like his soul just left him, even though he had no external injuries--
I understand now. Mad was already broken at that time.
But, we have to keep living like this. Until the day of our death--when we break. For us who don't get sick, that's a time equal to eternity. That's why we try to be human. Wouldn't it be too sad otherwise? We take over the work that our partners were doing, or we take over the work of positions that have disappeared... We keep the world turning, just like humans did. So that this world that humans were running never stops.
Mad ran the general store.
There were photo studios, bars, and all sorts of shops in town.
All of that was the work of the Philoids.
It was the effort of the Philoids to protect the human world.
It was the last hope of the Philoids who had been left behind.
We spend every day so that when humans return someday, we can tell them about that fun world, so we can return it to them.
Shiona showed me a smile.
An emotion that definitely doesn't fit the current situation.
With that smile, Shiona was protecting herself.
That smile looked sad to me.
But... we Philoids also have a flaw. That is, if something unbearably painful happens, some kind of emotion just comes to the forefront. I'm like this, Mad is always angry, and Tippy-chan is always sad.
But, Shiona continued.
That's our last stronghold. If even that emotion disappears, we'll break... we'll die.
Then, when Shiona was shot, Mad was--
That's right. He didn't just go on a trip. After Ray finished showing him that movie, Mad was bro--no, he had stopped moving.
Then, closing the store was--Shiona?
Yeah. I thought that if I didn't, Ray would have doubts, even if the townspeople didn't. And you did, didn't you?
Well, yeah, but...
If the store had remained open there, I would have definitely gone inside and found Mad, who had stopped moving.
If the humans hadn't come, I probably would have never noticed.
In the end, it was confirmed that I wasn't just seeing things.
I didn't want to believe it, but that was the truth.
My brother used to say, 'Emotions are pieces of the puzzle of life.' The pieces of emotion connect life. If emotion is missing, all the pieces will crumble away. That's the same for humans and Philoids. Mad broke because the emotion of anger towards his son was dissipated.
If that's the case, then I killed Mad.
I found the playback device on my own, and I showed Mad his son's movie without permission.
If I hadn't done that, Mad would have continued to move without breaking.
Sensing my feelings, Shiona moved to my left side and placed her hand on mine.
It's okay, it's not Ray's fault. Sooner or later, we're all destined to end up like that. It's the same as humans not being able to escape death. Mad was surely happy. He was able to know his son's true feelings at the end.
Maybe. But--
An unbearable feeling swells up.
If I had known that back then--I would have stopped him, even if I had to force him.
You're so kind, Ray--
That's not true...
Shiona stood next to me.
I can't see Shiona's expression.
Anxiety beats against my chest from the inside.
Because even knowing, I still wish for it. I wonder if I'll ever see that smile again.
Shiona smiles sadly as she looks at her brother's photo.
That's why, when I first met Ray, I was so happy. Ah, so it was a dream after all. My brother was alive.
Dying.
Whether you know it or not, it's painful either way.
Made to be convenient for humans, forced to have a family, and then leaving behind only the pain of death.
Selfish and awful.
That's what we are, humans.
Tipi is feeling the loneliness of losing her family. That's why, if we act like family, she'll 'die'. But that doesn't mean I don't want you to say those words to Ray. We Philoids have a rule that we can't do or say anything that 'makes them realize we're Philoids'. Because it would shatter the humans' dreams. But I went too far... I'm sorry.
When Shiona lowered her head, a sweet scent wafted around.
Certainly, what Shiona did isn't something that can be forgiven.
But, considering Shiona's feelings, it was clear that that method was the most appropriate.
It can't be helped. Shiona was just following the rules, it's not her fault.
This is how someone forgives someone, and someone is forgiven.
Apologizing, and being apologized to.
Crying, getting angry, laughing.
That's what humans are.
They, the Philoids, knew that better than anyone.
Thank you for telling me, Shiona. For being so kind to me, a human--
I felt ashamed as a human.
To think I'm repaying the kindness of these Philoids who are doing so much with evil.
Even as we speak, humans in town might be 'disposing' of Philoids.
And the Philoids probably can't even put up much resistance against it.
Thinking that, I couldn't hide the pain in the depths of my heart.
Shiona gently reached out and embraced me.
A warm warmth enveloped me.
Of course. Humans and Philoids are partners, both in the past and now. It's decided that it will be that way far into the future, too.
I felt like the emotion I couldn't understand until the very end was there.
It was warm, vast, deep, strong, gentle, soft, large, and precious.
Humans had lost something significant.
But, they remembered what the humans had forgotten.
For many years, many decades, many centuries.
While enduring loneliness, they continued to protect it.
I felt like I had to inherit that and protect it in the same way.
It wasn't an obligation or an order.
It was something I myself desired.
"I'm back, I found some pretty water."
While Shiona and I were sharing body heat, Tippy called out to us from behind.
For some reason, I felt embarrassed, and I instinctively distanced myself from Shiona.
The warmth that had been touching my skin was snatched away by the air.
But, that gap was immediately filled with a new warmth.
I saw that Tippy had slipped in between Shiona and me.
"Tippy too--hug."
Shiona and I exchanged glances.
Shiona seemed to be entrusting the decision to me.
Tippy had lived in solitude for two hundred years.
If things continued as they were, Tippy could continue to live semi-permanently without breaking.
But, would that be happiness?
Does an empty life have any value?
I embraced Shiona.
Including Tippy, who was standing between us.
Shiona also embraced me in the same way.
Tippy hugged both of us and muttered softly.
"Warm..."
It was warmth for the first time in two hundred years.
Tippy had been waiting for something so trivial for two hundred years.
That was a very sad time...
If I could give Tippy two hundred years' worth of warmth, I would definitely want to give it to her.
Because then, I feel like I could say that the time Tippy waited wasn't wasted.
"What are you going to do now, Rei?"
While still hugging Tippy from behind, Shiona asks me.
"If I could... I still want to help everyone in town... but I don't think I can right now."
I feel bad for the townspeople, but I don't have the power to do that.
First, I want to ensure the safety of Shiona and Tippy.
"It's a little far, but let's go to the factory where I woke up."
No, that place probably wasn't a factory.
A facility where people would sleep until the world, uninhabitable due to war, and its polluted land, became even slightly better.
My... awakening was a little late.
"There was still electricity there. Shiona and I can ingest food orally, so if we have the food we brought from town, we'll manage somehow. But in Tippy's case, she needs to be charged."
"Shiona..."
She probably realized it just from those words. Tippy raised her voice.
"Yes, that's right... I'm sorry."
"No. I thought I had to say it soon."
Somewhat sadly, yet with a slightly stiff expression, Tippy continues.
"Tippy too, has to do what Tippy can... while there's still time."
"...Tippy-chan?"
Something must have caught her attention, as Shiona questions Tippy.
"The three of us, let's survive."
Those were aimless words.
There was no guarantee, nothing.
Even so, I could only continue to say those words.
"We, the three of us, will survive forever and ever."
It was just an ideal.
I know the world isn't sweet enough to live on ideals alone.
Of course, Shiona probably knows that too.
Even so, Shiona doesn't express any doubts to me.
Anxiety or dissatisfaction.
She sealed all of those words away.
Surely her heart must have been filled with them.
In fact, my heart was being ravaged by those feelings.
Even so, it was necessary.
Words of hope.
"...Yeah."
Shiona nodded and hugged me and Tippy even tighter.
And so, we began our journey towards the facility.
"This is, outside of town..."
Facing the wilderness, Tippy hugs her bear tighter to her chest.
"Is this different from the scenery Tippy knows?"
"Yeah. When I saw it before, there was a road, a forest, and then--then--"
The scenery Tippy described was like a larger-scale version of the festival days Shiona had told me about.
It seems that in those days, humans freely controlled not only towns, but also nature, the Phylloids, and even the weather.
"So... by the time I started operating, humans were already beginning to decline..."
Shiona seemed a little lonely. The hem of her clothes fluttered wildly in the dust-filled wind.
"Alright, let's go!"
With a little food and a spare battery for Tippy, we started walking through the wilderness to survive.
And above all, to survive.
Struggling, struggling, to survive.
Floundering, floundering, to stay alive.
Just being alive is enough.
Just being alive had value.
I truly thought so from the bottom of my heart.
Using the position of the sun, faintly perceptible through the dim clouds, as a guide, I walked while searching my memory.
As the sun set and the temperature dropped, the three of us snuggled together and fell asleep.
Sometimes singing songs, sometimes encouraging each other, sometimes joking around...
We continued on a journey that was not just painful.
We crossed the reddish-brown earth and reached our destination three full days later, as the sun was beginning to set.
"The building is half-buried in sand... no wonder we couldn't find it. I can't believe this kind of facility was still around..."
As we entered, faint lights flickered on, and the air conditioning hummed faintly from somewhere.
The room was exactly as it had been when I woke up. For now, I gathered up all the Phylloid parts that would be unpleasant for Shiona and Tippy.
I'm sure these Phylloids were protecting us humans while we were in cold sleep.
"Yay, I can sit down!"
Tippy ran over and quickly sat down on the sofa that was there.
As soon as she sat down, all the strength seemed to drain from her body.
It seems I was pushing her pretty hard.
"...It's kind of cold here."
"It was originally a facility for cold sleep, after all."
Even though we're inside, it's a little colder than outside.
Now that the air conditioning is working, I'd like to think that the function to raise the temperature inside the facility is still working too.
But I don't know where it is.
"I wish we had a heater or something..."
"I know what to do. Rei, sit next to Tippy-chan."
"Like this?"
"Get closer!"
"L-Like this?"
When I asked that, almost completely pressed against Tippy, Shiona looked satisfied and said,
"Yeah, that should do it!"
And then she sat down on the opposite side of Tippy from where I was snuggling with her.
--Snuggling close, just like Tippy and I were.
"See? Isn't that warmer?"
"Y-Yeah... I guess so."
It's certainly warm. It's warm, but...
"How is it, Tippy-chan? Still cold?"
"Hmm... warm."
Tippy narrowed her eyes and snuggled against my arm.
"Warm? Oh, good."
"Yeah, warm... so, so warm, Rei. It's like..."
"Like what?"
"When we're like this, it's like we're a family."
"............"
"Tippy's Papa and Mama used to hug Tippy like this a lot."
"Yeah. It's like that time, it's warm."
"...Yeah, it's warm, isn't it."
"...Hey, can you hug me again? Can you squeeze Tippy tight?"
I almost hugged her without thinking, but I stopped when I felt Shiona's sad gaze.
"Tippy-chan, I can't do that."
"Why? Won't you squeeze me tight?"
"Yes, that's right. Because Tippy-chan, we're not family or anything."
"Not family... is Tippy all alone?"
"Yes. No matter how long we're together, you're alone. That's something that can't be changed."
If you only picked up on the words, they were cold, as if she hated Tippy.
But now I understand.
That those words are filled with kindness.
The only emotion remaining within Tippy.
--Sadness.
To fill Tippy's heart would mean to release her from sadness...
In other words, it would be the same as dying.
Until now, I had been hugging Tippy without thinking.
But perhaps that was a kindness that was far too cruel.
No, perhaps it wasn't even kindness at all.
It was nothing more than a self-satisfying act that only shortened Tippy's lifespan.
Shiona had been enduring it all this time.
To protect Tippy's feelings of sadness... and more than anything, to protect Tippy.
She must have really wanted to hug her.
She must have wanted to pat her head and say kind words to her.
She must have wanted to give her a smile that turned her heart orange.
Without offering a hand to this blue girl, she had been enduring it all this time.
That's why I thought I had to endure it too.
That's what I thought, but--...I couldn't stop myself.
I just couldn't bring myself to leave this girl with such a sad expression in front of me.
I embraced Tippy, and Shiona along with her.
The back of my eyes grew hot.
I know this is an act that shortens Tippy's lifespan, but I ask myself why I can't stop.
Aren't I just temporarily satisfying my own desires...?
I really am just a human...
Selfish, full of self-interest, a human who hurts others.
I hugged them both tightly, painfully so.
I embraced the warmth of two people.
As if to fill the void of two hundred years, we brought our warmth closer together.
The warmth of three people doesn't let you feel the cold, even in the freezing facility.
It was that warm.
A melody naturally spilled from Shiona's mouth.
That song that Onii-san made.
That melody lights a warmth deep in my heart.
A gentle song echoes throughout the factory.
"Tippy, you know, I love this song that Shiona sings."
Tippy says, burying her face in my chest.
"It reminds me of when Papa and Mama were here... and somehow the tears just won't stop."
A girl repeating her sorrow.
Tippy has been repeating that sorrow for two hundred years.
I may not be able to wipe away those two hundred years of sorrow.
But I can give her this moment of warmth.
I decided to put those two hundred years' worth into this fleeting warmth and embrace them both.
But that small moment didn't last long.
"Huh... Tippy?"
I turn my gaze to Tippy, who is sitting on the sofa.
There, Tippy was blankly staring ahead.
"What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?"
"Hmm? ...Hmm..."
She doesn't seem to have much energy.
Is it because she's been released from the tension, or is it because she walked for so long?
Either way, it seems like she needs to rest.
"Tippy seems tired too, so let's call it a day and rest."
"...Y-yes."
Her reply is a beat late. It seems she was thinking about something.
"Rei, Tippy-chan might be running low on energy. That's probably why her attention is scattered."
"I see... then we need to replenish her electricity. --But how do we do that?"
"It's non-contact charging. The charging equipment should be common, so first we need to find a connector and charge the bear plushie."
"Got it. I'll ask you to confirm if I find something that looks like it."
"Leave it to me."
Leaving Tippy on the sofa, I start checking what's inside the facility.
Many cold sleep devices are lined up. I look for one that is still leaking cold air.
Then, I opened the maintenance cover at the base and examined some of the cables connected to the distribution panel.
Soon after, I found something that looked like a power connector connected to a thick cable.
"Yeah, this type should be fine. Tippy-chan, lend me the plushie."
Shiona borrows the bear plushie from Tippy, opens the zipper on its back, and exposes the connection terminal.
When she inserts the charging connector there, the bear's eyes blink twice.
That must be the signal that charging has started, Shiona sighs in relief.
Tippy also tightly grips the bear's hand. Just that seems to transmit electricity, and I feel the light in her eyes has intensified.
"Shiona, let's have a meal too."
I show her the oral blocks I found when I was looking for the charging cable.
It's the same thing I found when I was leaving this facility.
"The taste is nothing compared to Shiona's soup, but I think it has nutrition."
"No, I'm happy because I was hungry. Just being able to have a meal makes my heart feel warm."
I line up the portable dishes and place the oral blocks on top of them.
I thought it would make it look a little more like a meal.
Because it's a time like this, I want to cherish the everyday things, even the small ones.
I wanted to recreate, even just a little, what we used to do in that town──at Shiona's house.
"It looks delicious."
Shiona smiled, as if understanding my wish.
The two of us put our hands together before the meal.
Tippy, who had been watching us, came over to our side.
Then, she placed the bear plushie in front of us and put her hands together just like we did.
"Together with everyone."
"Tippy-chan...?"
"Haha, Tippy is a great feast. Very luxurious."
Tippy shyly gave a bashful smile.
It was a time of peace in these past few days filled with hardship.
Surely in the distant past, we humans lived such a life with our partners called Phylloids.
No, it should be a life we can still reclaim.
Just like I, who had lost my emotions, was taught by them... I should be able to reclaim the time I had forgotten...
I was thinking about such things as I brought the oral block remaining on the plate to my mouth.
──It was then.
『Warning. The wear rate of the main battery exceeds 90%. Please replace and maintain the battery immediately.』
Suddenly, Tippy started saying such things in a businesslike tone.
『An online replacement request will be made to the service center――The service center is offline. Retrying.――The service center is offline. Retrying.――The service center is offline. Retrying...』
"Shiona, this is――!"
"I don't know the details, but it seems Tippy-chan's battery can't be charged anymore."
"Can't be charged..."
Is the voltage different? No, that shouldn't be a problem since it's going through the bear plushie.
In that case, is there a problem with the battery itself?
If there's a possibility... could it be deterioration over time? Come to think of it, it's a battery that's been running for over 200 years.
It wouldn't be strange if it was completely worn out.
"Maybe we need a new battery..."
"A brand new battery... Besides, I think Tippy-chan's generation couldn't be replaced unless a specialized technician disassembled it once... !"
"No way..."
Cold sweat ran down my back.
In other words, Tippy will stop functioning as is--no, will she die?
"No, after coming all this way... !"
"It's okay... because I knew it would happen."
Tippy's voice returned to its usual tone, and we could only stare as if struck by lightning.
"Tippy-chan, you knew this was going to happen, didn't you--"
"Yes... I thought this would happen since I left the library. I also noticed that the battery charging rate had been dropping since 6427 days ago."
Tippy answered with a weak smile.
"More importantly, Tippy has to do what Tippy can do... Rei, could you bring me the metal bag Tippy had?"
"O-Okay!"
The slim, yet somewhat rugged, metal bag that Tippy had been carrying ever since she left the library. Carrying it, heavier than expected, I brought it in front of Tippy.
Tippy casually places one hand in the middle of the bag. With just that, the two locks on the handle side automatically unlocked.
Inside was a single black board. Its size was about that of a slightly larger book. However, it was much thinner, only about half the size of a short picture book.
Tippy carefully took it out with both hands and slowly turned to face me.
Rei. Place your palm here. The one that's not mechanical.
Like this?
As Tippy told me, I placed my non-prosthetic hand on the jet-black board. Then--
A fluent male voice echoed from the black board.
"Current administrator, Vortex Company MSK-3737 model name 'Dorothy,' individual name 'Tippy' has approved the continuation of work. Continuing registration process."
"Confirmed. Registration applicant, please state the name to identify the individual."
"Um... Rei."
"Understood. Registered <Rei> as the new administrator. Please receive a verbal explanation of how to use it from the current administrator. That is all."
Having said that, the black board fell silent.
"Tippy, what was that just now..."
"All the books that were in the library, digitized. It's a backup of Tippy's memory storage."
Tippy answered in a slightly tired--yet somehow accomplished--tone.
I recall the many handwritten books lined up in the library.
Tippy, who remembered every word written there without a single mistake.
So, Tippy was the one who wrote those books after all.
Even if she were to stop someday... no, predicting that she would stop, so that she could leave behind a record of the prehistoric civilization as books.
That place wasn't just a library. Tippy herself was the library.
"When you use it, place your hand in the middle of the board, just like before. That will activate the tablet—the board will light up. After that, you'll be able to call up all the data using the administrator's voice recognition function..."
"Then—"
As Tippy told me, I activated the board called a tablet. I placed my palm on it as I was told.
『Biometrics confirmed, administrator Rei authenticated. Which data would you like to load?』
"The manual! How to repair a Phylloid... um, how to replace the battery!"
『Initiating search... There are 3,195 items and 124,751 types of information regarding Phylloid repair methods. Narrowing down the search is recommended.』
"From those, Vortex Company MSK-3737 model 'Dorothy'."
『Initiating search... Condition matched.』
The surface of the tablet lit up brightly. And letters emerged.
『Repair by the user is almost impossible. Please allow it to rest until personnel from the service center arrive.』
My vision went dark.
"How is it? Is it working well?"
"Yeah, it's working... but..."
"That tablet... only has about... fifty years left... of operation..."
It's more than enough time for me, but for a Phylloid, and as a library management system, it probably isn't that long.
"Really, is it okay for me to use it?"
"Rather, use it. From now on... Tippy won't be useful anymore..."
"That's not true! Tippy has always been helping me!"
When I fixed Siona's music box, when I fixed Mad's projector. All of that was possible because Tippy remembered the library's collection perfectly and taught me.
"It makes me happy to hear you say that, Rei... From now on, please use this..."
Tippy, who had been sitting on the sofa, slowly lay down.
"Tippy!"
"Tippy-chan!"
I've been waiting for 200 years.
I can't let it end here.
Tippy's small mouth moved up and down.
It looks like she's saying something, but her voice is so small that I can't hear it.
I put my ear close to her mouth.
"Hey, Rei... Tippy had fun."
Tippy's hand was placed on top of mine.
It's a small, soft hand.
"Rei is the father, and Siona is the mother... Both of you are kind and a family I love very much."
No matter how coldly I treated her, no matter how much I pushed her away, I couldn't hide my true feelings.
Tippy had noticed.
How much we cherished Tippy.
From the moment we got involved, it was decided that Tippy would end up like this.
That there was nothing we could do about it.
Being alone all the time was the only way Tippy could live.
But that's impossible, isn't it?
Tippy has emotions.
We're not perfect enough to overlook sadness.
No, that's not what you call perfect.
Because we can feel sadness, we are allowed to have emotions.
Slowly.
Like a handkerchief sinking into the water, Tippy's eyes closed.
Even though she's a Philoid we created, we can't even save her.
We just create them and then can't do anything else.
Humans are truly selfish creatures.
"Hey, Siona..."
Tippy's eyelids slowly opened again. But the light had already disappeared from her eyes. She probably can't see anymore.
"I'm here... I'm here, Tippy-chan..."
Siona's voice was trembling slightly.
"I'm glad... Hey, Siona."
"Yes...?"
"Thank you for everything. You worked hard to keep Tippy from breaking, didn't you?"
"I think you realize this, but Tippy has been running for over two hundred years since she started operating... But her lifespan was originally one hundred and fifty years. So, this isn't Siona's or Rei's fault. It was meant to be..."
When Tippy left the library and came to the church, Siona apologized to Tippy, and Tippy forgave her.
That's what that meant...
"So, please. Siona, don't cry... Sing... Sing a song..."
"Yes... Yes--!"
"Tippy... Siona's song... I love it."
Siona began to sing a song. She hiccuped every now and then, throwing off the tune. Even so, Siona continued to sing. To that melody--.
"Tha...nk... yooou..."
Tippy smiled--and then stopped moving.
My hand trembled.
It wasn't just that.
My whole body was trembling.
Just now, on my lap, another small life had come to an end.
Some people might say it wasn't a life.
But to me, it was an irreplaceable life.
Siona quietly continues to sing.
The tune isn't off anymore. It's the same as always--but that song had a transparent resonance that went on forever.
It was a melody dedicated to Tippy.
Something hot ran down my cheek.
It ran down my chin and fell onto Tippy's cheek.
Tippy wasn't crying, but she looked like she was crying.
I hugged Tippy close.
That small body will never move again.
That mouth will never speak again.
Those hands will never draw again.
That is "death."
Warmth spread through my head.
Siona was hugging me.
Suddenly, my eyes grew hot.
This is emotion spilling out. An unbearable pain, an uncontrollable sadness... an immense sorrow.
For the first time in my life, I shed "tears."
Tears for Tippy--.
After that, our lives changed drastically.
The e-book terminal containing all the library's books that Tippy entrusted to me.
Thanks to what was once called a tablet, my knowledge increased rapidly.
How to grow crops, houses that can be made with just stone and mud, how to predict the weather, and the many animals and plants that can no longer be seen.
Furthermore, a database of newspapers spanning the past 350 years until the library ceased functioning.
I'm sure if I searched, I could even find information about myself.
"Ray, are you studying again today?"
"Yeah. There are countless things I need to remember."
"What kind of book are you reading today?"
"Survival--how to survive in any environment."
The power supply to the cold sleep facility wasn't that great. If that's the case, then I have to become able to manage to some extent with just a tiny amount of power.
I've already started securing drinking water using morning and evening dew, and the problem of securing drinking water, which was the weakest point of this facility, is improving considerably.
That's right, from here on out, we can no longer move forward by simply relying on physical strength and brute force like before.
From now on, what we need is knowledge. With knowledge, you can face many people alone, avoid confronting them in the first place--or even win.
It might even become possible to help the people in town.
I greedily absorbed the "power" that Tippy left behind.
While I was reading, Siona was singing beside Tippy, who had stopped moving.
Among the luggage we brought from town was Siona's older brother's music box.
Occasionally, instead of singing, she would turn the handle and play the music box's gentle melody.
It was a very peaceful and comforting time.
With my current "knowledge," it would be possible to live with Siona in this place forever.
That's why... I didn't notice.
That there was something wrong with Siona's body...
"Ray, dinner is ready."
Siona prepares the meal with a smile, as always.
She dissolves the oral block in water, making it into a soup.
It closely resembles the orange, fluffy soup that Siona always made for me in town.
"Thank you, this soup makes me feel better."
"I'm happy to hear you say that. It makes my heart orange."
"But, Siona's soup, the amount is small?"
The amount of soup in the bowl is less than half of mine.
"I'm a Philoid, so if I go into save mode, this amount is enough."
"Is that so?"
"Yes. So Ray needs to eat well. If you get hungry, you won't have any energy, right?"
Ah... why couldn't I realize it?
At this time... her functions as a Philoid were already declining...
She was only operating at a level sufficient for half the amount of energy I was using.
As always, I read a book, and Siona sang a song for me.
While tracing the surface of the tablet with my fingertip, I pondered if there was a way to free the people of the town.
Then, suddenly, the rhythm of the pleasantly flowing song stopped.
Wondering if something was wrong, I looked up and saw Siona frozen while holding her hand over her mouth.
The music box she was holding had also stopped.
"Siona...? What's wrong?"
"Um... no, it's nothing. Just the song..."
She said that and took a deep breath.
And then she starts singing again──
"...Ah? What was the pitch again...?"
"Sio...na...?"
"Ahaha... that's strange, even though it's a song I loved so much, just wait, I'll remember it soon..."
Siona closed her eyes and tried to sing from the place where she kept stopping.
But the melody flowing from her mouth was completely different from what I knew.
"What's wrong... I can't remember my brother's song..."
"Siona!? Is there anything wrong with your body!?"
I was an idiot. In the end, I was only thinking about myself.
Siona was kind to me, cherished me, and I was satisfied with that, spoiled myself... I wasn't thinking about her.
Even though she was caught in an explosion that lost the artificial skin on her arm when we left town.
"Siona! At the time of that explosion, you were actually seriously injured, weren't you!"
Siona thought for a moment, then shook her head.
"I was okay then, yes."
Siona—Philoids don't lie.
But, she will hide words while thinking about humans.
Since she said she was okay, there probably wasn't any damage from being caught in the explosion.
As she said—"then."
"...Siona. Could you show me your condition?"
"...Okay."
Urged by me, Siona hesitated only once before nodding.
I almost averted my eyes in embarrassment at the suddenness, but what was there wouldn't let my gaze go.
Siona's white and firm chest.
There, a small hole was open.
"That is..."
Forgetting that it was a woman's body, I approached the wound.
This is a gunshot wound.
I immediately remember the time at Mad's shop when she protected me from the humans.
"It hit you..." I said.
"I was wondering if I was okay, but it seems that wasn't the case," Siona said.
Siona stuck out her tongue and smiled like a child caught doing something mischievous, but without showing any signs of guilt.
I know that's a smile to keep me from feeling guilty.
Even at times like this, she's thinking about me.
"...Search! MODA-117 Alice mk-17 Maintenance Manual!"
Reacting to my voice, the tablet glows faintly.
But Siona covered the screen with her hand. And then slowly shook her head.
Without losing her smile.
"It's my body. I know it best."
"But... there might be something we can do! If you had told me sooner..."
No, there's a reason she didn't say anything.
Siona knew that she had a fatal injury that couldn't be healed.
No matter how much I struggle, it's a reality that won't change.
It's something too horrible to even put into words.
The word 'death' floated into my head.
No matter how much I don't want to think about it, it just pops into my head.
"I know. I'm going to die soon. Since I'm a Philoid, should I say 'break down'?"
No, Siona.
You're not breaking down.
You're going to die.
"Ahaha, I guess I lost a little focus, I don't have any strength in my body..."
As if her shoulders slumped, Siona fell straight toward the floor.
"Siona!"
I hurriedly caught her and held her in a position that would be as comfortable as possible.
How long has she been like this?
Why couldn't I have noticed...?
"Breaking down... does that mean I'll stop being me...? But, maybe it can be fixed...?"
"It's okay... Siona is Siona..."
"Ahaha... you know, I'm... a little scared right now..."
"Siona... Siona..."
"Don't cry, Rei. Tippy-chan will laugh at you if you do."
Siona's hand reaches for my cheek.
It was my second tear that she brushed away with her fingertip.
"I don't want Rei to turn blue.... I always want you to be orange and fluffy..."
I'm sad.
An immense sadness wells up within me.
It multiplies infinitely in my heart, never ceasing.
As time passes, that sadness becomes more intense.
Why am I so sad?
The answer comes quickly.
Because you're precious.
You were a precious existence to me.
Even if a Philoid with the same appearance appeared before me, it wouldn't mean anything.
It's okay if the appearance is different.
As long as the inside is you.
"Rei... you know, I thought of you as family. It's partly because you resembled my older brother, but it's not just that. I thought you were important,"
Family.
That is, an existence that can be believed in and helped unconditionally, without any benefit.
That is 'love'.
The emotion I had been wanting before I knew it.
I had realized that emotion before I knew it.
I had been given it all along... all along.
It's such a natural emotion to have while living and walking with someone.
"What's wrong, Rei... don't make such a sad face... That's right, let's sing a song, let's go to the plaza again... everyone will be happy."
"...Siona...?"
"Something I promised everyone. Rei gave everyone smiles, you made them feel happy."
That is a memory of happier times. Memories of the fun days we spent in town.
It's probably a confusion of memory areas.
But...
"...Yeah, let's sing. Everyone's looking forward to it."
I turned the handle of the music box that was placed on the floor.
The melody quietly begins to flow.
Siona's cheeks relaxed, and she closed her eyes and began to sing.
I also closed my eyes, listened to the melody, and reminisced.
It wasn't a long time, but I recalled the scenery of that town where I spent my time.
People walking down the street stopped and turned to look at us.
One by one, they gathered in the plaza.
Children, the elderly, someone's mother, her husband, the townspeople all began to smile.
As if intoxicated by Siona's singing melody.
Surely that scene was commonplace in the distant past.
Humans and Philoids alike, smiling, living together, supporting each other.
It's the obvious thing that we've forgotten... the obvious thing we've lost...
"Hey, Rei... always, always keep smiling, okay?"
"...Yeah."
"It's okay to be sad, it's okay to be angry... But... after that, smile."
"Hey... if love has a shape, it must be round. Because love never hurts anyone."
Holding back tears, I smile.
"Hey... if love has a temperature, it must be warm. Because love warms you as if enveloping you."
"Yeah... I'm sure it is."
"Because there's love, Rei won't be sad. Because love is something that protects, and it won't hurt Rei. I promise. No matter what happens from now on, our love will protect Rei."
I had cried so much that my eyes were starting to hurt.
My vision blurred.
But even through that, I could see Siona's smile clearly.
"So don't cry. Love is always by your side. Because love is eternal. You don't have to cry. Because it's eternal."
I placed my hand over Siona's hand, which was on my cheek.
It was warm, but she had almost no strength left.
It was as if something was spilling out from between her fingers.
I knew what was spilling out.
But I didn't want to admit it.
I gripped her hand tightly, wishing that it wouldn't spill out.
I could hear a song.
The warm melody that Siona always hummed.
It seeped into the cracks of my darkening heart, filling it with warmth.
"I'm sorry, for leaving you alone again."
"--! That's not true. That's not true!"
I wanted to tear at my own hair.
I finally realized it now.
Siona wasn't afraid of breaking. She was afraid of me being alone again.
"I... I received so much, so much from Siona...!"
"Rei?"
I take Siona's mechanical hand with my human hand.
That's right, until I met Siona, I was an in-between existence, unable to become either human or Philoid.
Siona stayed by my side all that time—and I was able to become human.
"Siona will always be inside me, I'm not alone anymore. Joy, sadness, anger... I received them all from you. There's no way I could forget."
Ah... Damn it, I have to smile here.
I have to reassure Siona, but my emotions won't allow it...
No matter how hard I try, tears spill out from the rising sadness.
"So Siona, don't make such a sad face. I'll be okay. I'll definitely be okay."
"I see... then, I'm glad."
Siona nodded, looking satisfied.
"Huh..."
Siona narrowed her eyes as if confused. Then, as if pushed out from her eyelids, transparent droplets began to cover her eyes.
"I'm sure... that's different..."
I said in a trembling voice, smiling reassuringly at Siona.
Now that I've become human, I understand the meaning of those tears.
Siona seemed to realize it soon after, and smiled back at me.
"Tears... they also flow when you're happy, right?"
The strength slowly drained from Siona's body.
Am I smiling? Am I?
I wonder if I'm able to keep smiling, so Siona doesn't get worried.
"...See you later."
"...Yeah, see you later."
Softly.
Siona closed her eyes.
In that instant, Siona had probably the most beautiful face I had ever seen.
And after that, Siona never opened her eyes again.
That peaceful face looks like it's smiling.
As if she's praying for my happiness.
But there's no happiness in a world without Siona.
The life that continues for me from now on is hell itself.
Can I endure it?
...No, I have to endure it.
My chest tightens so much it hurts.
All my emotions circulate through my body, creaking.
Is my heart this fragile and weak?
Is losing someone important this painful?
"Ugh... Aah...!!"
My vision is dyed pure white, and as if to destroy that world, I raised my voice and lamented.
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah...!"]
Siona said.
Certainly, Siona's love may be eternal.
But, I couldn't bear it.
I understand, this is emotion.
What Siona gave me.
This suffering, this sorrow.
But, it's not just that.
The warmth that barely remains in my heart, and the memories with everyone that I can proudly say were fun.
All of that too, Siona gave me.
Both of them are mine now.
I will never let go of either.
How much time has passed?
How much time does a human need to sort out their feelings?
I... I kept remembering the time I met Siona, over and over again.
The meals we ate together.
The times we woke up in the morning and exchanged greetings.
We went shopping together.
I went to the abandoned factory and made her worry.
She was so happy when the music box was fixed.
We sang in the town square, surrounded by smiles.
I made a promise... .
I learned warmth.
I learned joy.
There were times I felt anger.
There were times I shed tears of sadness.
And... I received love.
──No... everything was love.
This tragedy was brought about by the foolishness of us humans, who lost that love.
Humans are hopelessly selfish.
They will repeat the same things over and over... .
Even so, they will need someone.
It's instinct. Even when I woke up here, I wanted to see a human.
It's the instinct to seek love, to want to walk alongside someone.
I can't even realize something so simple... .
I look at the cold sleep devices in front of me.
I had Siona and Tipi sleeping in the few that were left, the ones that were functioning properly.
They were originally for humans, but this should help slow down the deterioration a little.
I wanted to preserve their appearance, even just a little.
Standing before the two of them, who look as if they are merely sleeping, I mutter.
"Siona, Tipi... I'm going now."
There's no reply.
There couldn't be.
But I continued.
"I'm going on a journey now. Don't worry, it's not a journey without a purpose. I'm going to find a world where humans and Phylloids can coexist."
That was also the wish that the excluded human youth spoke of.
If there is a world where humans and Phylloids can coexist, this kind of sadness won't happen.
If there is a world where humans and Phylloids can coexist, there is no greater joy.
That's why I'm going to go find it now.
"And if that world doesn't exist──"
I clench my iron fist as if covering it with my bare palm.
"──No, it definitely exists. The world that you tried to leave for us humans definitely exists."
Finding it will be extremely difficult.
But I have the knowledge that Tipi gave me.
And I have the emotions that Siona gave me.
In this world, there is a partner who continues to convey "love".
So, this journey from now on is not a journey of despair.
"I'll borrow this, okay? I'll come back to return it someday."
In my hand is Siona's older brother's music box.
I turn the handle in front of the sleeping Siona, letting the melody of peace packed inside resonate.
In time with the melody, I felt like I could hear her song.
"Well then, I'm off."
A world where humans and Phylloids can hold hands--.
I took that first step.
"Even so, I remained hopeful and continued to reach both arms toward the light."
"Are you awake?"
"...Where... is this...?"
"You've awakened from a long sleep. Do you remember your name?"
My name is...
"I am an Asou International product, MODA-117 Alice mk-17. An individual name has not been set."
"It seems the settings have been initialized. For now, Alice will do."
The man in front of me held out an old wooden box.
"What's this...?"
"It was inside the device you were sleeping in."
I take the box. It feels very nostalgic.
When I open the lid, there's a dull golden disc. When I turn the handle coming out of the side of the box, a clear tone begins to play.
A very beautiful melody flows as the metal comb is gently plucked.
"It's a song that's been played since long ago."
A melody that isn't in my records.
But even so, it's very nostalgic, warm, and makes my chest feel all warm and fuzzy.
And at the same time...
Hot tears spill from my eyes.
"Emotional function runaway confirmed. Maintenance may be required."
"No, that won't be necessary. You should cherish those emotions. ...Only the knowledge was left behind, but it took a great deal of time to recover the technology to make use of it. I'm sorry."
The man speaks to me gently.
I feel a nostalgic shadow in his expression as well.
It's not in my records... my memories...
"For now, shall we go home after completing the routine maintenance?"
"Where to?"
"To town."
Outside the facility was dazzling.
The sky was blue and endlessly high. White clouds slowly drifted by, drawing various shapes.
Warm air filled my artificial lungs. A gentle breeze softly stroked my hair.
It was a natural sight.
For some reason, I felt nostalgic for this ordinary world.
And... for some reason, I felt very sad.
We drive along the paved road.
Every scene visible from the window is beautiful.
Lush greenery thrived.
Small fish leaped on the surface of a clear stream.
In the sky, small birds chirped and flew together harmoniously.
"Alright, we're here."
Passing through the gate, we arrived at a town surrounded by white walls.
It was overflowing with many people.
Humans and Phylloids alike, holding hands and living ordinary lives.
That sight makes my eyes grow hot again.
"Excuse me, there is still a risk of emotional function runaway. The rhythm pattern in my chest is also not at a normal value."
"It's alright. I'm sure it's the right thing."
"Is that so? In that case, am I a defective product?"
"No, you're normal. You're closer to a human than any other Phylloid."
Those words were very pleasing to me as a Phylloid.
But I don't understand why I'm being told that.
I gaze intently at the town that I feel nostalgic for.
In a corner of the plaza, a human child and a child-type Phylloid are playing happily.
That place is a photo shop. The Phylloid owner is smiling as he takes pictures of a human family.
At a general store in a separate location, a human is shopping and the Phylloid owner is responding curtly.
"Sensei, welcome back!"
A very cute Phylloid girl runs up to me.
"Hey, I'm back. Have you been a good girl, Dorothy?"
"Yes! I drew lots of pictures while Sensei was gone. Look!"
The little girl shows me the picture she probably drew, with a beaming smile.
The townspeople are in a circle, laughing.
The picture drawn with crayons is very warm, and just looking at it makes my heart feel warm.
It was a picture that made everyone who saw it feel happy.
"Huh? You are..."
The girl looks up at me.
"Nice to meet you. I'm Alice, nice to meet you."
"Ali...ce? Hello Alice. Dorothy is Dorothy because she isn't registered."
"Yeah, me too."
An unregistered Phylloid. If I don't have a primary partner, what should I do?
Perhaps sensing my anxiety, the man next to me patted me on the shoulder.
"What do you want to do?"
"...What can I do...?"
"Alice, can you sing a song?"
"Yes, a song. Like this."
Dorothy closes her eyes and begins to sing.
It was a little clumsy, but it was a song I recognized.
"It's a song that has been sung since long, long ago. There's no one in the world who doesn't know it."
The man said that and took out a music box from the car.
He opens the lid and turns the handle protruding from the side of the box.
Clear sounds are plucked, and a gentle melody begins to flow.
As if drawn in by the melody, the townspeople gather around.
Everyone listens to the tone, their expressions becoming calm.
I know this scene.
In the deepest part of my memory, which should be pure white--a memory that breathes faintly gently taps my chest.
My mouth moved naturally.
The song I should be singing for the first time was familiar to my throat, my lips...my heart.
The music box melody filling the square is very nostalgic.
Wow, that's so pretty. You're so good!
Yes, this song is...a very important song.
