──The air shifted.
The pale blue light that had enveloped me until then receded.
Eventually, what came into view was a stained ceiling.
My right arm, extended towards that spot, was slightly different from my left arm, which was also extended.
From the wrist down, my right arm was made of exposed mechanical parts.
My fingers moved smoothly, but each time, a small metallic scraping sound echoed.
Next, I slowly raised my upper body.
That's when I realized the pale blue light that had been in my vision earlier was an oval-shaped lid with a gentle curve.
It seems I had been sleeping inside this capsule-like object.
Where is this place?
Who am I?
Why am I here?
I asked myself, but found no answers.
Even when I tried to recall my memories, all I had was the memory of the pale blue light.
To search for clues to my memory, I got out of the capsule and decided to wander around the room.
Although I knew the act of walking, it felt like it had been a long time since I had done it, and my steps were unsteady.
Paying attention so I wouldn't fall, I slowly moved forward.
The air was lukewarm, and dust clung to my throat every time I inhaled it into my lungs.
Light streamed in from a hole in the ceiling, and along those rays, the dust in the air was revealed.
It's likely that no one has been in this building for a long time.
Thin layer of dust covered the floor.
What kind of place is this?
Numerous oval-shaped capsules were scattered throughout the large room.
Most of them were open.
They were empty.
Even if some were closed, there was nothing inside.
It seems I'm the only one in this room.
──No, to be precise, that's not true.
There were people leaning against the oval objects or lying on the floor.
But, no.
To be precise, those aren't people.
It would be more accurate to say they are humanoid objects.
Those humanoid objects had mechanical parts peeking out from under their skin.
Some had mechanical parts from the neck up.
Some had exposed mechanical arms.
Some had their lower bodies torn off, revealing mechanical parts.
That's when I remembered what those humanoid objects were.
Partners for Humans, created for Humans.
They were the beings closest to Humans, equipped with not only the five senses but also emotions.
I reached out my hand to the Philoid that had stopped functioning.
The exposed hand, not covered by skin, was remarkably similar to my right hand.
This is a factory.
I was made here.
...However, it's likely the facility was abandoned for some reason just before completion.
Staring at my mechanical right hand, before it was covered with artificial skin, I concluded the most likely possibility.
Understanding my own existence, I started walking towards the wall.
There was an old automatic door there, and right next to it, an LCD panel displaying "CLOSE" was covered in dust.
I touched it with my mechanical hand.
The moment I felt something cold, like electricity, on my bloodless fingertips, it displayed "OPEN" and the door opened.
Could I get out of here?
Is there anyone left in this facility?
I wanted to meet someone.
I wanted to meet a Human.
Let's go find them, my partner.
I pushed open the door leading outside.
To prove my own existence.
When I returned home, I headed straight for the living room.
There was the broken music box.
I opened the book I borrowed from the library and studied its structure.
Just as I thought, a gear inside was chipped.
That's why no matter how much I turned the handle, the disk wouldn't spin and no sound would play.
...But what should I do about this gear?
Would it be possible to make one to the exact size described in the book? No, it's impossible.
Without finding an answer, I continued through the pages of the book.
At the back, there was a list of products by manufacturer and a list of parts used.
As I skimmed through it, my gaze caught on something.
What I learned there was that the manufacturer who made this music box also made clocks.
If that's the case, they might be using the same parts for the intricate sections as they do for clocks.
Suddenly, I remembered what I had broken at Mr. Mad's shop.
That clock... if he's going to throw it away because it's useless...
If I use parts like the gears from inside the clock, I might be able to fix the music box.
"Ray, what are you doing?"
Just as the possibility of repair became clear, Shiona entered the living room.
"Shiona, listen. I might be able to fix the music box with parts from the clock at Mr. Mad's shop."
"Really? Truly?"
Shiona had an even happier smile than usual.
From her expression, I could tell how happy Shiona was.
"But please don't push yourself. Even without the music box, I can still sing."
Shiona took the music box in her hands and began to sing.
That song she sang in the chapel.
That song that felt somehow nostalgic.
That song that warmed the depths of my chest.
Looking at Shiona gazing lovingly at the music box, my resolve grew stronger.
I want to fix this music box for her.
And I want to make Shiona happy.
That feeling swelled within me.
"Tomorrow, I'll go to Mr. Mad's shop again."
I'll try to ask if he can give me the clock.
But there was one thing that bothered me.
That was the fact that I had broken the clock.
I apologized, but it still felt difficult to go there.
Thinking about being yelled at by Mr. Mad again made me scared.
"You know, I want to make lots of people smile with this song of yours, big brother."
Shiona's words reached me as I hesitated.
"This song is orange... and I'm sure it can make many people's hearts orange. Because it's a song that was created with the wish that it would become like that. Because that's your wish, big brother. That's why I want many people to hear this song. And I want to make many people smile. That's my wish."
Shiona said, as if talking to herself.
Those words gave me a push.
Let's go to Mr. Mad's shop again tomorrow.
And let's apologize again for breaking the clock.
With Shiona's singing voice and the music box, I firmed my resolve.
The next day, I visited Mr. Mad's shop alone.
I can't count how many times I thought about turning back on the way.
Every time I thought that, Shiona's smile came to mind.
I want to see that smile forever.
That's why I want to fix the music box for her.
I recalled my resolve from yesterday many times.
What I can do for Shiona.
I steeled myself and stepped into Mr. Mad's shop.
"What nerve do you have, showing your face here?"
Immediately after, Mr. Mad's low voice, like distant thunder, rained down on me.
I wanted to run away immediately, but I didn't.
"I wanted to apologize more properly for yesterday."
"About the clock? You already apologized for that."
"Shiona was there at the time... I wanted to apologize properly, by myself."
"I don't need that. Just go home."
"I can't do that. I'm truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday."
"No matter how much you apologize, the clock is still broken. Go home."
"I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry."
With my head bowed, I continued to apologize.
How much time had passed?
Eventually, Mr. Mad's voice, slightly softer, reached me.
"...Look up."
When I did as I was told, Mr. Mad's face, looking somewhat exasperated, was there.
"Good grief... what a guy. You're incredibly persistent."
"I'm sorry..."
"Don't apologize anymore, or I'll knock you out!"
He said that, but there didn't seem to be as much anger as yesterday.
I thought I heard a small sigh.
"You're done with your business, right? Just go home."
"Um... I have just one favor to ask."
"A favor? You've got some nerve asking me for a favor."
My feet froze from the pressure, but Shiona's words pushed me forward.
"That clock... would you let me have it?"
"...Say that again."
"Um... yesterday's clock, would you let me have it--"
"DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!"
I froze solid, standing perfectly still, as if struck by lightning.
"You broke it yourself and now you want me to give it to you? Don't get carried away!"
It's no use...
Not anymore...
As I was about to run away, a voice called out from behind me.
"Please wait, Mr. Mad. Ray just wants to fix my brother's music box."
There was Shiona, who was supposed to be waiting at home.
Shiona stepped between me and Mr. Mad, unafraid of him.
"My brother's music box is broken, and Ray said he would fix it for me. He just needs the parts for that. He's truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday. So, could you please forgive him?"
Shiona told Mr. Mad, keeping her smile.
"Mm... Mmm-hmm..."
Mr. Mad, who had been bright red, his expression gradually softened.
"But, that clock isn't here anymore. I threw that thing away. However..."
Mr. Mad turned his back to us, but continued to speak.
I threw it away at the abandoned factory on the outskirts of town. I don't know what happened after that."
After saying just that, Mr. Mad sat down facing the wall.
"Thank you, Mr. Mad."
Shiona bowed without losing her smile and left the shop.
"Ah, thank you..."
I also bowed the same way and left the shop.
"The abandoned factory is very close to where you collapsed, Ray,"
Shiona told me as soon as we left the shop.
"Um, you mean Shiona goes there to throw away garbage?"
"That's right. Garbage from various places gathers there."
"Could it be that he fixes things he picks up from there and sells them here?"
"Yes. Mr. Mad often goes to that place."
I see, that's why there were so many old things in the shop.
He probably brings things he can use from that place and reuses them.
Anyway, I decided to head to that abandoned factory.
"Shiona, if you don't mind, I'd like you to guide me to that place."
"I'm sorry, the red children are coming to my house today."
She was probably talking about the children Shiona was talking to yesterday.
Come to think of it, I had promised to treat them to soup.
"But Ray, you can't go alone, can you? I'll break my promise with the children."
"No, it's fine, Shiona. Keep your promise."
"But how will you get there?"
"I'll try going to the library. I want to know about this area, and I want to look at a map."
"The library..."
Shiona's expression seemed to cloud over a little.
"Huh... No, it's nothing. ...Hey Ray. Is Tipy attached to you?"
"I don't know. I don't think she dislikes me, but why?"
"No, it's nothing. There's definitely a map at the library. Have a good trip."
"Yeah, I will. See you later then."
I turned on my heel and started to head towards the library.
The smile I saw on Shiona's face at that moment seemed to me to contain a hint of sadness.
But I didn't know the reason why.
"Ray, you came."
Tipy was in the same place as yesterday, crying the same way.
"Yeah, I came. Hey Tipy, can I ask you something?"
"Is there a map of the town in this library?"
"Yeah, there is. There are lots."
"That's good. Can you show me where the map is?"
"Okay, but... but..."
Tipy was somehow hesitant.
"No, that's not it... That's not it, but..."
"Can you hold me?"
Tipy's face turned a little red.
Her sad expression hadn't changed, but her cheeks seemed to soften just a little.
"...Hold you? Hold you, you mean like yesterday?"
"Yeah... Is that okay?"
"It's okay. Here, come here."
"Yeah... yeah..."
When I spread my arms, Tipy stood up and, with some hesitation, jumped into my chest.
Unlike yesterday, I was holding her.
But I felt the same way.
Tipy, whom I was holding, was still small, soft, and seemed like she might break.
"Tipy, is this okay?"
"Yeah, it's okay. Ray... you're warm."
Tipy rubbed her cheek against my chest.
That gesture warmed the depths of my heart.
Could this be the feeling of endearment?
I want to protect this girl.
I want to stop these tears.
I held Tipy for a while.
"Um, walk that way while holding me like this."
Tipy pointed her finger down the aisle from inside my chest.
Still holding her, I headed in the direction she indicated with her fingertip.
"Why do you need a map?"
"There seems to be an abandoned factory near town. I want to go there."
"Why to the abandoned factory?"
"There might be a part I'm looking for there."
"For the music box you were looking at yesterday?"
"Yeah, that's right. I really want to fix Shiona's brother's music box."
"Shiona's... I see. I hope you find it."
While being held by me, Tipy led me without hesitation to the bookshelf where the map books were kept.
"Could it be that you remember where each book is?"
"Yeah, mostly."
"That's amazing... Did someone teach you?"
"No. While I was waiting for my dad and mom, I did it by myself."
When she mentioned her dad and mom, Tipy's eyes became a little teary.
"Um... is it this one?"
To change the subject, I took out one of the map books.
I sat down on the spot and opened the book.
Like the music box book, this map was also handwritten.
Could it be that all the books in this library are handwritten?
If so, that's a considerable amount.
Who on earth handwritten this many books?
The work, which must have taken endless hours, makes me feel faint.
"It's pretty worn out... How old is this book?"
"Um... I don't know. It's a book from a long, long, long time ago."
It seemed like a map from decades ago.
The buildings themselves look the same as the current townscape, but...
The pages were badly faded, as if tea had been spilled on them.
Some were stuck together, and it seemed like they would tear if I turned them.
I carefully turned the pages.
"Ah, maybe it's this one?"
I found the map symbol for a factory in the northern part of town.
Considering the direction of Shiona's house, it's highly likely this is the place.
"Ray... are you leaving? Don't go..."
Tipy clung to my neck.
I stroked her small back with my hand many times.
"It's okay, I'll come again."
"Really? Will you really come again?"
"Yeah, of course. I promise."
Absolutely? You'll absolutely, absolutely come again, right?
Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely.
Again and again, I made promises with Tipy.
Why is that?
Even so, I felt reluctant to leave the place.
A feeling of wanting to stay by Tipy's side forever was welling up inside me.
Hiding that feeling, I left the library.
When I entered the abandoned factory, guided by the map, the smell of oxidized oil stung my nose.
This factory must have originally made Philoid arms and legs too.
Around the area, parts of unfinished Philoid arms and legs were scattered everywhere.
They were all before the artificial skin was applied, with the mechanical parts exposed.
If I looked closely, I could see that they were made the same way as my right hand.
Even though I knew they were artificial, this sight was strange.
To move the arm that was lying around, I pushed it aside with my right hand.
A sad sound of metal hitting metal echoed through the factory.
If any part of my body breaks for some reason, I'll come here.
Here, there are mountains of replacement parts.
In the back, there were many drums filled with oxidized oil lying around.
Most of it was oxidized, but there was also some unopened oil.
Even if I run out of oil, I can perform maintenance here without being seen.
The further I went into the factory, the more the worries I had in the back of my mind were resolved.
This abandoned factory should become an important place for me.
But I can't find the crucial thing.
That is, of course, the clock that Mr. Mad said he threw away in this place.
But inside this factory, there isn't even a single thing that looks like trash, let alone a clock.
Could it be that the trash isn't inside the factory, but thrown outside?
I left the factory for a moment and decided to go around its perimeter.
Then, on the back side of the factory, I was able to find an area where mechanical parts were piled high.
Of course there were mechanical parts, but there was also a lot of trash thrown away.
Surely this is where the town's trash dump is.
Besides Mr. Mad, there must be others who take things that can be used from here.
Looking up at the mountain that was many times my height, I thought such things.
...Now, where could it be?
There's a considerable amount of trash.
It's going to be tough to find it by diligently searching.
But there's no other way.
I immediately decided to start searching from the ground.
I don't know how much time passed.
My sense of time was long gone.
My hands were covered in mud from moving muddy metal plates and containers covered in waste oil.
My clothes were sticky with oil, and somehow they had gotten a lot of stains.
After that, I crossed the carpet of trash, swam in the river of filth, and was battered by the waterfall of scrap.
And then, I finally found it.
It was at Mr. Mad's shop.
The one I broke yesterday.
That clock.
I picked it up and stared intently at the hands on the face.
Naturally, it wasn't moving.
I put my ear to the body, but it didn't make any sound.
It was natural, since I had broken it.
This clock will likely never tell time again.
That fact pricked a small spot deep in my chest.
I gently hugged the clock and decided to head home.
Shiona welcomed me back with kindness.
"I'm home. I found it."
When I held out the oil-stained prize, Shiona smiled gently.
"It's true, thank you. Here, change your clothes, change your clothes."
Shiona had prepared a towel and a change of clothes for me.
After wiping away the dirt and changing, I headed to the living room.
There, Shiona welcomed me again.
"Ray, you must be tired, right? Eat something and rest."
"No, I'm fine. I want to start working right away."
"Are you sure? I'm worried about your body, Ray."
"I'm okay. Strangely, I don't feel tired right now."
"But, you have to eat..."
"Yeah, I know. I'll eat later, so you go ahead and eat."
"...Okay, I understand. Good luck."
Shiona left the living room.
Seeing her off, I started working.
I opened the book I borrowed from the library beside me.
This music box works by turning the handle, which causes gears of various sizes inside to interlock in a complex way, making the disc rotate at a constant speed.
It seems turning it faster doesn't necessarily make the song faster.
I thought that was a really amazing technology.
Following the assembly instructions written in the book in reverse order, I disassembled the music box.
And as I compared the parts one by one, I found that a gear in the power transmission section was broken.
Is it true that for something that moves precisely, just one small part breaking is enough to make it stop moving?
I couldn't help but look at my right hand.
For now, let's find a gear of the same size as this broken one from the clock.
Next, I started disassembling the clock.
I removed the lid and used a screwdriver to remove the screws.
When I removed the cover, the internal structure was revealed.
Gears much more precise than those in the music box were interlocked in multiple layers.
One of them, the shaft of a slightly larger gear, was broken. That's why the part wasn't turning.
This must be the place I broke yesterday.
The fact that Mr. Mad threw away this clock means he didn't have a gear of the same size as this one.
What was fortunate was that the broken gear wasn't the size needed for the music box.
Disassembling things feels somewhat reluctant.
Because I'm breaking this clock to fix the music box.
Is it because I understand what kind of being I myself am?
Hesitantly, but as a gesture of respect, I disassembled the clock as carefully as possible.
I lined up the clock's gears on the table, from the smallest ones, and compared them to the music box's.
"...Found it."
I was able to find a gear that seemed to be almost the same size.
Now, all that's left is to transplant this into the music box according to the book.
"I think this should be okay..."
With this, the disc should move without any problems.
I put the lid back on and turned the handle, and I felt resistance.
But the handle wouldn't turn any further.
Why is that?
I reread the book.
The parts and their positions are correct.
Tilting my head, I removed the lid again.
Then, I tried turning the handle as is.
The gears certainly meshed perfectly.
However, because it hadn't been used for a while, the oil seemed to have completely dried up.
That must be why the handle wouldn't turn.
What should I do?
Should I go to Shiona and borrow some cooking oil?
...No, that's also a problem.
Cooking oil and gear lubricant are probably different types.
It might work at first, but it could cause a malfunction later.
Then, what should I do...?
Suddenly, I looked at my right hand.
Although it was covered by a glove, there were exposed mechanical parts underneath.
How about using the oil used in my hand?
I took off my glove and carefully examined my right hand.
The exposed mechanical parts.
Oil was built into the interior to make those parts move smoothly.
I inserted a screwdriver into the palm near the base of my thumb.
When I removed the exterior, it was packed with mechanisms for moving the mechanical hand, such as wiring, cylinders, and shafts.
One of the cylinders inside contained oil.
And it was detachable so that old oil could be easily replaced.
I removed the cylinder with my left hand and dripped the oil that filled it onto the music box gears.
I spread the oil with my fingertip so that it would blend into all the gears as much as possible.
Will it work?
I put the cylinder back into my right hand and reattached the exterior.
After hiding my mechanical arm with the glove, I cautiously tried turning the handle.
At first, it was stiff. But as I turned the handle, the gears ran smoothly.
The handle continued to turn without any resistance, likely because the oil had circulated into all the gaps between the gears.
And then, that melody began to play.
"Ray, that song...!"
Shiona suddenly entered the room.
"Yeah. It's fixed, Shiona."
"Thank you... Thank you, Ray. Thank you... I'm so, so happy."
Shiona showed me a smile I had never seen before.
Just looking at that smile made a spot deep in my chest warm up.
And then, I realized.
Ah, this is it.
Is this the feeling of being happy?
I am happy right now.
Seeing Shiona's smile, I am happy.
And for the first time, I felt a sense of being useful.
"Thank you, Ray, thank you."
Shiona took my hand and thanked me repeatedly.
As her face drew closer, I felt my face grow hot.
"Thanks to your hard work, Ray, the music box is fixed. I can hear that song again, the one I had given up on. This orange song that my brother made. This song that I love so much..."
"Hey, Shiona, sing it. Let me hear your brother's song."
"Yes... of course!"
I turned the music box handle.
Shiona clasped her hands in front of her chest and began to sing along with the melody.
The song she sang when we first met.
The song Shiona's brother made.
The orange song.
Now, I felt like I understood its meaning.
The feeling dwelling in my chest is joy.
Shiona's song.
And Shiona singing happily.
Just watching her made joy overflow within me.
More than ever, Shiona sang that song happily.
That day, Shiona kept singing until she fell asleep.
I also listened intently to her singing voice and the melody.
Again and again, Shiona asked me to play the song.
Shiona kept singing until my arm could no longer move.
Looking at her expression, I thought.
I want to stay with Shiona like this forever.
If Shiona wishes for it, I can stay with her forever.
But for that, my true identity must never be revealed.
Never, absolutely never...
That day, I solidified my resolve to stay with Shiona forever.
At night, in the darkened room.
On the two beds side by side, Shiona spoke to me.
"Will you listen to my request?"
"You see, I want many different people to hear this song. And I want to make them smile. I want to make many different people happy with this song my brother made."
I knew the words.
But I didn't understand what it was.
Was it a state?
Or was it an emotion?
I repeated the word "happy" over and over in my head.
"And so, I want you to help me."
"Help? How should I do that?"
"Tomorrow, I want you to go to the plaza with me. And I want you to turn the music box."
"Then, Shiona will sing, right?"
"Yes, that's right. And I want as many people as possible to hear it. That orange song my brother made..."
"Yeah, I want to do that too. Of course, I'll help."
I heard the sound of the sheets rustling.
"What's wrong, Shiona?"
"Hey, Ray... can we hold hands?"
I couldn't see Shiona's expression in the darkness.
But I felt like Shiona's face was turning red.
"Hands? With me?"
"Yeah, I want to hold hands with Ray... Is that... not okay...?"
I searched through my knowledge.
I know the act of holding hands.
But what does it mean for a boy and girl of that age...
"No, it's fine..."
If a human... if Shiona asks for it, I want to respond.
Fortunately, she was on my left side.
I think it's fine with the hand covered by artificial skin.
I reached my hand out to the next bed.
In the cold room, the hand I extended felt a little chilly.
I searched for Shiona's hand in the air.
A touch, warmth.
Shiona's hand overlapped with mine.
"You're warm, Ray."
"Yeah... you're warm, Shiona."
We held hands.
Without either of us initiating, our fingers intertwined.
It wasn't just the warmth emanating from our hands; a different kind of warmth spread.
Was this the warmth of a human, different from my artificial warmth...?
"Ray... tighter."
"...Like... this...?"
"Sorry, did that hurt?"
"No... it was just stronger than I expected."
"Is this tightness okay?"
"Yeah... Thank you, Ray."
We held hands all night.
Our hands remained linked until morning woke us up.
The next day, the plaza was filled with sound.
The melody that Shiona and I began to play.
Shiona sang.
And I turned the handle of Shiona's brother's music box.
At first, there were no people passing by.
But as if drawn by Shiona's singing voice, their numbers increased.
One person, then two, stopped, and soon a small circle formed.
That circle quickly grew larger, and the deserted plaza rapidly became a scene of great liveliness.
Everyone present was listening intently to Shiona's singing voice.
A young couple leaned against each other, holding hands.
An old man closed his eyes with deep emotion.
A young man gazed at a woman a little distance away.
A young parent and child laughed happily together.
Children moved their bodies to the music.
Each person listened to Shiona's song with their own feelings.
But there was one thing they all had in common.
That was that everyone was 'smiling'.
Everyone who heard Shiona's song broke into a smile.
Feeling that I was cooperating in making the people in this place smile right now, I felt warmth deep in my chest.
This is the feeling of being happy.
The feeling I felt yesterday when I saw Shiona's smile.
This is what it was.
I am happy.
I felt my cheeks lift slightly.
Surely, I was smiling too.
Perhaps it looked a little awkward.
But that was fine.
If I could get even a little closer to Shiona, I was satisfied with just that.
The music box, which I had just repaired, continued to play the melody without a hitch.
The handle turned smoothly.
The sound flowing from the disc resonated and was amplified inside the wooden box, coming out as a clear tone.
According to Shiona, it was an orange melody.
Shiona sang along to that melody.
I wished this time would last forever.
This time when I could make people smile.
And I wanted to keep watching Shiona's profile as she sang so happily, forever and ever.
Suddenly, my gaze drifted towards the library on the outskirts of town.
It was because I thought I saw the closed curtains sway slightly.
For a moment, I even saw a small figure.
I knew who it was.
That blue girl who was always crying.
Tippy.
She was probably crying even now.
Alone in that library--.
Just thinking about it made my chest ache a little.
It was like a thorn had been stuck in it.
How must Tippy have felt, watching this circle?
The ever-widening circle of smiles.
Everyone in it was smiling and sharing the same feeling.
Among them, I noticed one person with a scowl.
It was Mr. Mad, with his shoulders hunched and arms crossed.
He was the only one with the emotion of 'anger' on his face, completely out of place.
I suddenly made eye contact with Mr. Mad, who harbored that emotion I didn't yet know.
It was for less than a second.
Mr. Mad immediately snorted and turned on his heel, disappearing into the crowd.
Seeing him, I thought.
I want to make everyone smile.
The two people showing sadness and anger.
I want to make Tippy and Mr. Mad smile.
But how should I do it?
While turning the music box handle, I kept thinking about that.
After the song ended, I went to Mr. Mad's store alone.
I couldn't help but be bothered by that scowl from before.
I cautiously stepped into the store, which was as dim and eerie as ever.
There were no customers.
Only Mr. Mad was sitting on a chair by the register.
But something was off about him.
Unlike before, he wasn't leaning back in his chair.
He was just staring intently at something that looked like a small, square chip in his hand.
His expression was still stern, but there was also a hint of loneliness about it.
"Um... Mr. Mad?"
When I spoke to him, Mr. Mad quickly hid the chip in his palm.
"Oh, oh, what do you want? You, why did you just come in?"
"Rather than 'just came in,' it's a store, so it's free to enter..."
"Don't be ridiculous! You're a rude fellow to enter my store without my permission!!"
He was saying something completely unreasonable.
"But for Mr. Mad not to notice me coming in, you must have been really focused on that chip."
"I'm talking about the chip you're hiding in your palm."
"I'm not hiding anything like that!!"
"But I saw it. If you're not hiding it, open your palm and show me what's inside--"
"Shut up and get out! And don't you ever come here againnnnnn!!"
As if pushed out by his words, I was chased out of Mr. Mad's store.
Even though I came to make Mr. Mad smile, I ended up doing the exact opposite.
Shiona was waiting for me in front of the store.
Her smile made my chest feel a little warm inside.
"Huh? Shiona, why are you here?"
"I was curious where Ray was going, so I followed you."
"I came here thinking I'd make Mr. Mad smile. But I just made him angry again..."
"Making Mr. Mad smile, huh... That's a really difficult thing to do. So don't worry about it. It's normal for Mr. Mad to get angry."
"But today, he seemed angrier than usual."
"Angrier than usual? Did something happen?"
"I'm not sure, but I asked him about a chip."
"...A chip?"
"Yeah, it was a square chip, about the size that would fit in his palm. Mr. Mad was staring at it..."
I shaped the size of the chip Mr. Mad had in his hand with my fingers to show her.
Shiona's eyes widened slightly, as if she knew something about that chip.
"Did you perhaps ask him about that chip?"
"Yeah. And then, he suddenly got angry--"
"Mm-hmm, I see. Ray, that can't be helped."
"Can't be helped? What do you mean?"
"Because that chip is Mr. Mad's treasure."
"Mr. Mad's treasure? What's inside it?"
"It should contain a movie that his son made."
"His son's movie? Is Mr. Mad's son a movie director?"
"Yes, that's right. Although, he left this town quite a while ago and hasn't come back since."
Shiona said that while looking towards the store.
With a strange expression that mixed two emotions: looking troubled, but still maintaining her smile...
"But why is he just staring at the chip? Why doesn't he watch the movie?"
"That's impossible. There's no equipment in this town that can play that chip."
"So, Mr. Mad is staring at it like that because he can't watch it even if he wants to?"
"I'm sure that's it. He's shy, so he won't say it out loud, though."
At that moment, I had an idea.
A way to make Mr. Mad, who always scowled and was always angry, smile.
"Uh, it's nothing. Shiona, there's somewhere I want to stop by, so you can go back first."
"Somewhere you want to stop by...?"
"Yeah, there's something I want to look up."
"...The library?"
I felt like Shiona showed a somewhat surprised expression.
Was she worried about me, who wasn't used to the town yet?
"I'll definitely make sure not to be late."
To lessen the burden on Shiona's heart, I said the words clearly.
Shiona opened her mouth as if to say something, but closed it right away.
And then once. After a gesture of lightly biting her lip for just a moment, she smiled.
"...Okay. Be careful, Ray."
I parted ways with Shiona in front of Mr. Mad's store and started walking through the town alone.
Inside the library, it was as dim and the air was as stagnant as ever.
Through the labyrinthine interior, I headed straight without getting lost.
Towards the blue girl who was always shedding tears--.
"Ray, you came."
When Tippy saw me, she stood up and ran towards me.
I gently held her small body.
"Yeah, because I promised."
"Thank you, Ray. I'm happy."
Tippy buried her face in my stomach.
I could feel her tears through my clothes.
"Tippy, what were you doing?"
"Drawing. Come here, Ray."
With my hand held, I walked as Tippy led me.
On the spot where Tippy had been sitting, drawing paper and crayons were scattered.
There was an unfinished drawing on the drawing paper.
"Did you draw this, Tippy?"
"Yeah. I draw one every day."
Saying that, Tippy resumed her drawing.
I peered into the drawing.
There was a drawing of a singing girl and a boy turning a music box.
"Tippy, could this be...?"
"It's Ray and Shiona. Singing in the plaza."
As I thought, Tippy was watching us from behind the curtain.
Thinking of Tippy watching us alone, for some reason, my chest ached a little.
"Ray, what's wrong? Are you feeling sick somewhere?"
The girl's eyes, looking up at me, were filled with sorrow.
I placed my hand on Tippy's head as if to comfort that emotion.
"It's okay, it's nothing. This is a really good drawing."
"Yeah... Thank you. I'm happy."
When I stroked her head, Tippy snuggled up to me affectionately.
But her face was fragile and sad--.
I truly wished I could see this child's smile.
"You said you draw one every day, but do you have other drawings?"
"Yeah, I do. Ray, come here."
Tippy stood up, took my hand, and led me deeper into the library.
There, the drawings were.
There were many drawings pasted on the low part of the wall, probably by Tippy herself.
"This is the drawing I drew yesterday, this is the day before that, this is the day before that..."
Tippy explained each one.
A drawing of a girl holding hands happily with a young man.
A young man and another girl visiting the girl.
And a drawing of a girl crying alone.
Ah, I see.
This is Tippy's drawing diary.
From then on, the drawings of a girl crying alone were lined up.
Since I came here, Tippy hasn't been alone anymore.
The expression on the girl in the drawing seemed to have softened a little.
Surely, that is Tippy's emotion itself.
But it is still just something that contains sadness.
I wanted to make this girl smile too.
What could I do for that?
I couldn't think of an answer.
The only thing I could say was that I would stay by Tippy's side like this.
"Hey Ray, what kind of book did you come to look for today?"
Tippy, still wearing a sad expression, pulled on my sleeve and looked up at me.
"I'm looking for a device that can project images... Is there a book that knows about that?"
"Yeah, there is. It's a little far from here, though."
"Will you show me?"
"Yeah, okay. Here!"
And so Tippy spread her arms wide.
The teddy bear in her right hand dangled in the air.
"Hold me."
I picked Tippy up.
Just like before, she rubbed her cheek against my chest.
"Over there, Ray."
I stayed like that and started guiding her to the book I was looking for.
That book was on the second floor of the library--.
It was in a corner of the shelves where materials related to images from all times and places, such as projectors and projection machines, were gathered.
"The book you want to read is probably here."
All the books lined up on the shelves, just like the music box books and maps, were handwritten.
However, it seemed there were quite a few types of projectors, some using film, others using discs.
"What kind are you looking for?"
"I'm looking for something that can project a chip about this size, do you know?"
I used my fingers to show the size of the chip Mad had.
"Hmm... square? A square with one corner missing?"
"The corner was... it felt like it was missing diagonally... I think."
I hadn't looked at it very carefully, so I couldn't say for sure.
But Tippy nodded, just a little.
"That shape, is it the chip Mad has?"
"Yeah, it's the chip Mad had."
I was surprised that Tippy knew about Mad too, but since he was the owner of the general store in this town, there was nothing strange about it.
Even Shiona knew about Mad's chip, and maybe everyone in town knew.
And it was probably common knowledge that Mad was stubborn and wouldn't look at the contents.
"Um, well... if it's that... this one."
Standing on her tiptoes, Tippy pointed to a book on a shelf just within her reach.
"That's amazing, Tippy. As I thought, you remember the location of all the books."
"Ehehe~. I was praised~."
Tippy pressed her face into my stomach.
While stroking her head, I took the book and checked its contents.
It was more like an instruction manual than a book.
'Mume Co. Projector'--It detailed the types of playable media and chips.
The internal structure and wiring were also carefully written down.
It seemed to be a projection-type player that could project the contents recorded on a portable chip onto a screen or a white wall.
If I could find this device, I could show Mad the movie inside the chip.
"Thank you, Tippy. I found the information I needed."
"...Are you leaving already?"
Tippy looked up at me with a sad expression.
"...Yeah, I'm sorry."
"No way~. Don't go."
Was she trying to stop me from leaving?
Tippy hugged me.
Her innocent warmth shook my resolve.
But I had to go.
Because right now, I want to make Mad happy.
Because I want to see Mad's smile.
"Tippy, I promise. I'll definitely come again tomorrow."
"Tomorrow...? Really...?"
"Yeah, really. I promise."
"...You won't disappear?"
"Yeah, I won't disappear. I'll definitely come to see you every day."
"...Okay. I'll be waiting."
With a heavy heart, I left the library, leaving the blue girl—Tippy—behind.
"You're back again! What are you here for?!!"
As soon as I visited the store, Mad's angry roar greeted me.
I wanted to run away.
I wanted to cover my ears.
But I didn't.
Because I wanted to grant Mad's wish.
"Mad, I have a favor to ask. Please lend me your son's chip."
"That chip with your son's movie on it."
"Why should I lend it to you? Don't be ridiculous!!"
"Please... please."
"Stop being so nosy! You're a nuisance!"
"I... I want to be of help to you, Mad!!"
"Help?"
As Mad's gaze grew even sharper, a feeling of fear began to work, and my throat constricted.
The movable parts of my knees lost strength, and I felt lightheaded.
I want to run away right now... but I can't hesitate here.
"Shiona told me about that chip. That your son left town aiming to be a movie director. And that's the movie sent by your son, right? But you haven't been able to watch it because you don't have the playback device, is that right?"
I spoke quickly to suppress my fear, rushing my words out.
Perhaps pushed by my momentum, Mad looked at me with a slightly surprised face.
"I just went to the library. To find out which device could play it."
"You... went to the library...?"
At the word 'library,' Mad looked even more surprised.
"Yes... I'll find a device that can play that chip. Even if the player is broken, I'll fix it. If I can't find one, I'll make one by connecting various parts."
"Why are you going that far? It has nothing to do with you."
"That may be true. But I want to do it."
"I want to be of help to Mad... that's all. So, please."
Silence continued.
Was this a silence of affirmation, or was it--.
"He was the worst kind of idiot son."
Mad sat down on a chair and looked up at the ceiling.
And with a somewhat sad expression, he began to tell me a story.
We always fought.
Whenever we met, all we did was fight.
So at some point, he started avoiding me.
No, maybe it was me who was avoiding him.
Anyway, we stopped seeing each other's faces often.
So I was surprised when he said he had something to talk about.
"I'm leaving this town."
"Leaving town? What are you talking about?"
"I'm leaving this town and becoming a movie director. After all, I love movies."
"Stop talking about dreams and face reality. Someone like you can't be a director. There's no way you can do it."
"Don't just decide it's impossible! You won't know until you try!"
"I know, I'm your father. No one will watch a movie by a director with no talent."
"There are people who recognize me! I've gotten results! You're just the one who doesn't recognize it!"
"You can't even dream if you stay in a town like this!"
"A town like this? Say that again."
I'll say it as much as you want. A life spent in a town like this, in a shop like this, I can't stand it.
You... that's enough...
I'll say it as much as I want! You're afraid of changing!
Ever since Mom died, you've been doing the same thing every day--
Without thinking, I hit him.
...See? Always violence. I've had enough.
...Alright, get out.
Yeah, I'll do that. You can keep doing the same thing here forever.
My son left home.
And since then, he hasn't even sent a single message.
The only thing he sent was the movie on this chip.
How am I supposed to watch something without a playback device?
I can't forgive him for being so selfish.
I don't want to watch a movie like this.
I definitely don't want to see his face.
I was surprised by how talkative Mad was, more than usual.
The more I heard his feelings, the more my own feelings grew.
If Mad truly hated his son, he wouldn't need to keep holding onto a chip he couldn't play forever.
If his son hated Mad, he wouldn't have sent the movie he made.
Surely, he wanted Mad to see this movie.
I think he sent that chip to Mad with some kind of feeling in mind.
That's why I want to show this movie to Mad.
I bowed my head again.
Please! Lend me the chip!
Mad came in front of me without a word.
I was prepared to be yelled at, but I no longer felt afraid.
More than that, the desire to be useful to Mad was stronger.
But Mad handed me the chip he was holding.
Do as you please.
I looked at the chip I received again.
It had a metal core covered with organic glass, with rainbow-colored electronic circuits running through it.
I had knowledge of it. It was a general-purpose chip also used for Philoid's memory backup.
It had become a world standard, and most manufacturers adopted this format.
If that's the case, it might be playable even without a Muum company projector.
I gripped the chip and bowed my head towards where Mad was.
The abandoned factory on the outskirts of town.
I stepped into the mountain of garbage behind it.
I thought that if there was a device to play Mad's chip, it would be nowhere else but this abandoned factory.
If it were in town, he would have played it long ago.
There was a lot of equipment mixed in with the garbage.
Things with broken wires, things that were rusted.
From what I could see, everything was unusable.
The possibility of finding the desired projector itself in this place is low. But I think I can find some kind of part, like a circuit board.
Just as I told Mad, I'll assemble it so that the chip can be played, even if I have to connect parts.
This is the only place I can rely on.
If I don't do something here, Mad will stay with that expression forever.
I won't let that happen.
I don't want that to happen.
With just that single thought, I started digging through the mountain of scrap.
But no matter how much I searched, I couldn't find the device I was looking for.
Surely Mad must have searched too.
No... maybe Mad is still searching even now.
Shiona said that Mad fixes things he picks up from this garbage dump and sells them at the general store.
Perhaps his real purpose was to search for a projector to play his son's chip.
If that's the case, how must Mad have felt, not being able to find it all this time...?
What was he thinking when he picked up other things instead of a projector... and when he repaired them...?
And I broke Mad's watch.
Ah... I see... that's why Mad was angry.
That watch was something that was part of his process of trying to get back something important to him.
This is speculation. But I want it to be true.
If that's the case, I probably won't be able to easily find what Mad has been searching for all this time.
Even so, I won't give up.
Finding the projector should be the greatest atonement for me, who broke the watch, towards Mad...
It was when I was dragging a piece of equipment larger than my body.
I felt a strange sensation in my right hand.
A very small strange sensation... I felt a stiffness in the movement of my finger joints.
Had the oil run out, or had something broken?
It might not be good to continue working like this.
I couldn't stop moving my hands.
Mad must have searched within the range of his sight.
I looked up at the mountain of scrap metal piled much higher than my height.
If I'm lighter than Mad, maybe I can climb it.
As soon as I thought that, I started climbing the unmaintained, awkward stairs.
I felt water hitting my back.
From the sky I looked up at, large drops of rain were pouring down.
"Ray, let's stop."
A voice came from a position lower than my feet.
When I turned around, Shiona was there.
She was looking up at me, getting wet in the rain.
"It's raining. You'll catch a cold if you stay like this."
"It's okay, I'll look a little longer, thank you."
"Even if you don't find it, you tried so hard, so Mad will be happy."
"It's okay, Shiona. Just a little longer."
I continued working.
From behind me, Shiona kept talking to me unilaterally.
"But you're already drenched. Let's stop. You're tired, aren't you? No one will blame you if you give up."
As if to soothe me.
"I'm worried about your body, let's stop? I'll be sad if you get hurt, Ray. ...Knowing when to give up is important too."
"There might be other ways, so let's go home today. I've prepared the orange fluffy soup."
"Let's go home now... Ray, let's go home... Hey, Ray... I'm worried about you, Ray..."
Even so, I continued.
Undeterred by the pouring rain, I kept searching.
I pulled out a rusted iron plate.
At that moment, a small avalanche of scrap occurred.
I stepped back, avoiding the scrap that came stabbing at my feet with a roar.
"Look out, Ray!"
When I turned around at Shiona's voice, a mountain of scrap pouring down from behind me came into view.
The mountain piled up behind me had also avalanched in the same way.
While being swallowed, I somehow managed to run up the collapsing scrap.
After a while, the avalanche subsided, and only the sound of rain remained in the surroundings.
"Are you okay, Ray? Are you hurt?"
"Yeah, somehow... That was close."
"It really was... I'm so glad you're safe, so glad..."
Shiona let out a sigh of relief.
To prove I was safe, I stood up.
"Ah... Ray, that."
Shiona pointed at my feet, her eyes wide.
In the pile of scrap that had just collapsed, there was a piece of equipment I recognized.
It was the same equipment shown in the book Tipy had shown me.
I dug it out, and looking at the surface of the casing, I saw the faded letters 'Mume' written on it.
"I found it... Shiona, this is it! I found it!"
I lifted it up and held it high so Shiona could see.
The water that had accumulated inside flowed out as it tilted.
"I did it, I did it, Shiona! I finally found it! Now Mad can watch the movie!"
"Yeah, but... I think that machine is broken...?"
"Huh?"
At Shiona's words, I brought the hand holding the equipment in front of me.
Indeed, the equipment I found—the 'Mume Company Projector'—showed clear signs of damage.
The lens needed for projection was missing.
And there was a large crack on the top as well, and when I peered inside through it, the circuit board inside was covered in rust.
With this, I couldn't project a movie.
"That's too bad... Ray, let's go home now?"
Shiona's outstretched hand.
I placed my hand on hers.
Its warmth warmed my hands, which were cold from the rain.
By the time we returned to town, the rain had stopped.
Even so, my heart didn't clear up.
Could I really repair the projector I held in both hands?
Mentally, I was determined to fix it, but now that I saw how battered it was, that resolve wavered.
"What's wrong, all drenched like that?"
On the way back to the church, I was suddenly called out to.
Looking back, the director of the photo studio who had taken my picture before was standing there.
"I was just looking for something."
"Looking for something...? I see. So, did you find what you were looking for?"
"Yes... but..."
"Is something wrong?"
"I found it, but it's broken and can't be used."
Shiona answered for me, seeing how dejected I was.
"I see. That's a shame. By the way, what were you planning to use it for?"
"Actually... I wanted to play the chip Mad has."
"Mad's? The chip sent by his son, you mean."
"...Yes. I wanted to make Mad, who's always angry, happy..."
"Is that something you truly want to do from your heart?"
The director asked gently, yet as if testing me.
"Yes, of course."
I answered without hesitation.
"Mad... always looks angry, and he seems very sad. I'm sure if there's some kind of trigger, he'll smile. I think if people can smile, they can be happy. And I think other people who see that can also be happy."
After saying that much, I looked at Shiona.
"I... learned that from Shiona."
Shiona looked surprised at my words, but then she smiled.
Yeah, that expression. Someone's smile makes the people around them happy too.
The moment Shiona smiled, my heart also warmed up.
I see... May I see that?
The director pointed at the projector I was holding. I silently handed over the broken equipment.
The photo studio director examined the equipment carefully.
I see, this is terrible. There are too many missing parts to fix it.
Hearing that from the director, who usually maintains cameras, made my heart sink.
Perhaps noticing my dejected mood, the director returned the projector with a wry smile.
Ray, let's go home quickly? You'll catch a cold.
That's right. Staying wet from the rain will be bad for your body. It's better to go home and change for now.
I'll just cause the director more trouble if I stay.
Even if I'm fine, Shiona, being a human, will catch a cold.
Hugging the projector, we bowed to the director and headed towards the church.
When we returned to the church, Shiona dried my head with a fluffy towel.
Gently, softly, tapping carefully so as not to rub.
That's too bad about the projector.
...Yeah, but that place was originally a garbage dump, so it's only natural that it was broken.
It was something I should have realized with a little thought. And yet, I was hoping for a convenient outcome.
Hoping that if I wished for it, things would work out. That if I tried hard, results would surely follow.
I was reminded that reality isn't that sweet.
It can't be helped. Ray tried his best, so no one will complain.
But... but I wanted to show Mad the movie.
Yeah... Ray, you're kind.
It's not kindness or anything like that. I just think it's my role.
But Mad will be happy just with that feeling. That's enough.
I hope so...
For now, let's warm up? I'll make us something to drink that will warm both our bodies and hearts.
Folding the towel she used to dry my head, Shiona smiled and headed towards the kitchen.
I sat down in a chair and sighed.
I looked at the broken projector placed on the table.
...No, there's no point in being dejected.
Even though it's broken, it's a little bit of progress compared to having nothing at all.
If I fix this projector little by little, I should be able to play the chip someday.
The book I borrowed from Tipy had instructions on how to disassemble it for maintenance.
If I unravel it step by step, I should be able to fix it.
As for the missing parts, I can just look for them one by one at that factory.
I want to see Mad smile. I want him to show an expression of joy, like Shiona did when the music box was fixed.
I reaffirmed my resolve to fix the projector.
Just then, I noticed that the main hall of the church was getting lively.
Excuse me.
Opening the door and peeking my head in, I saw the photo studio director there.
And behind him, even more townspeople.
What's going on?
When I asked, looking puzzled, the townspeople smiled and offered me something.
Here, these are parts from my broken clock. Feel free to use them if you like.
Wiring, I thought maybe this might fit.
You can use my light.
No, use my light.
We have lots of tools at our place, so feel free to use as many as you need.
Various electrical components, wiring equipment, electronic circuits, gears, and screws were placed on the table one after another.
As I stood there, dumbfounded, unable to comprehend the scene, the director smiled warmly.
...Um, what is this?
You're going to fix that projector, right? When I told everyone about it, they brought things they thought you might need. There might be some unnecessary things among them, but it's better to have materials than not, right?
Why would you do that...?
Everyone here was moved by your and Shiona's music and singing. They really wanted to show their gratitude. ...I'm one of them too.
The director took out a lens and handed it to me.
This is... a camera lens, but I wonder if it will fit?
I felt something warm deep in my chest.
And that warm feeling gradually rose higher and higher.
Eventually, that warmth reached the back of my eyes, becoming hot and intense.
Words wouldn't form properly in my head. I wanted to say something, but only my lips trembled.
Shiona, holding a steaming cup, watched me gently.
Shiona... my chest feels warm. Why is that?
Ray, that feeling is 'joy'.
Saying that, she approached me and handed me a cup containing a drink with a heartwarming scent.
Everyone is responding to your desire to make Mad smile. Everyone is centering around you, wanting to make Mad happy.
Am I not being a bother...? Even though I started this on my own.
If they thought you were a bother, they wouldn't have such warm smiles on their faces.
I looked at the townspeople who had brought the parts, one by one.
They held their respective parts in their hands, held them up for me to see, and smiled.
...Everyone... thank you.
Using the parts and tools I received, I started the repair right there.
I proceeded with the help of various people for the parts I didn't understand on my own.
I removed moisture, carefully filed away rusty parts, and repaired broken electronic circuits with copper foil.
I used the tip of a screwdriver heated until red to fix the solder that was coming loose.
No, no, it's not like that, it's like this.
No, no, it's like this.
You're both wrong! It's definitely like this!
Not this way, not that way.
Loudly, but cheerfully, the repair was done by everyone.
And finally--
The repair was finished, in a patched-up, awkward state.
Everyone, thank you.
It's nothing. In return, please let us hear that song again.
The children really liked it. Please do it again.
Listening to it with him, I can get into a good mood.
When I hear that song... it makes me remember the past...
I love that song, it's so fun!
The awkward machine that everyone made.
Its appearance was far from what I saw in the book.
But it was the only projector in the world, made by everyone.
I felt more joy than ever before.
Everyone there was genuinely happy about its completion.
Now, all that's left is to test it.
When they said 'test it', I looked around the room.
Come to think of it, I've never seen electricity in this town.
The photo studio also used analog cameras.
...Um, perhaps there's no electricity in this town...?
At my question, everyone in the room suddenly had startled expressions.
It was an awkwardness like I had touched something I shouldn't have.
Even the director, who had suggested the test run, fell silent.
It's the library.
It was Shiona who broke the awkward silence.
There's no electricity in this town, but the power storage facility is still here.
That's the library?
Yeah, that's right.
It was like a ray of hope had shone through.
I felt my cheeks soften.
But Shiona's expression—even though she was smiling, her eyes looked somehow sad.
The next day, I went to the library with Shiona.
I brought the handmade projector we built with the townspeople yesterday.
I didn't know there was a device like this here.
Equipped at the library counter was a device that could store electricity generated using solar power in a portable battery.
It seemed to be the only remaining device in this town.
However, due to the aging solar panels, it wasn't capable of generating a large amount of power.
Electricity, as an energy source, was precious in this town.
Despite my selfish request for such a precious thing, everyone in town gave their permission.
They always said, "In return, please let us hear your music again."
However, there was something that bothered me.
I felt that the library had some special meaning for the townspeople.
Everyone's reaction yesterday. Thinking back, even Mad's expression changed when I went to the library.
...No, I shouldn't make strange assumptions right now.
I averted my gaze from the battery that had started charging, and looked at Shiona, trying to hide the anxiety in my heart.
We'll have to ask Shiona to sing again.
Yeah, I'll sing with feelings of gratitude for everyone.
Shiona gave me her usual smile.
Next to Shiona was Tippy.
She was looking at Shiona with a slightly bewildered expression.
Come to think of it, this is the first time I've seen these two together.
Tippy, how long do you think it will take to charge?
Um... maybe about thirty minutes?
I see, that's surprisingly fast.
I can only be with Ray for another thirty minutes...?
Tippy took a wide detour around Shiona and hugged my leg.
Her sad expression hadn't changed.
But I felt that her sadness had eased just a little.
I stroked Tippy's head with my palm.
As I repeatedly stroked her hair, which felt like silk, Tippy rubbed her cheek against my leg.
...Alright, you two. That's enough.
Shiona stepped in between me and Tippy.
Ah... Ray, Ray...
Tippy reached out, seeking me.
But her hand couldn't reach me.
Ray, just a minute...
Shiona grabbed my arm and led me towards the wall.
--Shiona's sweet scent tickled my nose.
Ray, Tippy-chan is a girl now. Do you understand what that means?
I understand. She's adorable when she's attached to me.
That's not what I mean... I don't think it's good to touch her too casually or be too friendly with her.
Why? I think it's fine if Tippy is happy.
That's not it... I don't think it's good to touch a girl her age so casually.
Even if you say 'her age,' Tippy is still a child, isn't she?
Girls mature faster on the inside than they look. Her heart is already a lovely pink.
Pink...? What does that mean?
Pink is pink. So I don't think it's good.
Shiona seemed more flustered than usual.
Even though she was smiling as she spoke to me, her cheeks were puffed out a little.
Come to think of it, whenever I said I was going to the library, her smile would stiffen.
It seems Shiona doesn't really like me being friendly with Tippy.
Even now, she looks like she's competing with Tippy.
...Hey, Shiona. Could that feeling possibly be 'jealousy'?
At my words, Shiona's eyes widened and she gasped.
She moved her gaze restlessly, trying not to look at me.
It was the first expression I'd seen from her, who always had a smile on her face.
I reached out my hand to Shiona's head.
Huh? Ray...?
And I gently stroked her hair, just like I did with Tippy.
Wha... What, Ray, what's with the suddenness? What's wrong?
Unlike Tippy's, Shiona's hair was smooth and pleasant to the touch. It smelled nice every time I stroked it.
It was the kind of hair you'd want to touch forever.
R-Ray? I feel kind of embarrassed, you know?
Ah, sorry. But I just felt like this might be the right thing to do somehow.
I don't really understand why, but seeing Shiona like this right now makes my chest feel warm.
A feeling close to the joy I learned about before wells up inside me.
A-Anyway, let's try not to be so clingy, okay? Can you promise?
Yeah, if Shiona says so, I'll do that.
So, that's all I could say.
We returned to where Tippy was.
Tippy was looking up at us anxiously.
What's wrong? Tippy, bad girl? Is that why both of you are angry?
Tippy furrowed her brows sadly.
It's okay. It's nothing.
Really? Really, really not angry? Because Shiona's face... it's red?
Th-This is different, okay? I'm not red and prickly, okay?
Hmm... Okay, I understand.
Tippy shed tears of relief.
Honestly, I wanted to wipe away those tears with my fingertip, but Shiona would probably dislike that.
So I decided to suppress that urge.
I turned on the power of the projector, which had finished charging.
A low motor sound hummed, and the exhaust fan started spinning.
The light on the top, indicating that it was preparing to start, was blinking.
It was the light of electricity, which I hadn't seen in a long time. I, Shiona, and Tippy were all watching the blinking light with eyes that saw something rare.
Um... the place to insert the chip is...
The control panel was exposed, with the lid on the side of the projector broken off.
In the center of it, there was a place to insert the chip.
I slowly inserted the chip that Mad-san had entrusted to me.
The projector's reading lamp blinked red rapidly, trying to confirm the data inside.
We watched the scene, holding our breath.
After about 10 seconds, the interval between the lamp's blinks shortened—and it changed to a solid green light.
This... means it's okay, right?
Anxiety and excitement were mixed, and my voice was high-pitched.
Yes, the projector is fixed properly, and the data inside is also fine.
My chest swelled with Shiona's words. I could feel the corners of my mouth naturally turning up.
I felt "joy" in the satisfaction of having accomplished something new.
After finishing charging the projector and checking its operation, we headed towards Mad-san's shop.
Tippy said she was sleepy and stayed at the library.
I wanted to watch it together since we went to the trouble, but Shiona cautioned me not to push her.
I wonder if Mad-san will be happy.
Uh, yes... I'm sure he'll be happy.
I hope so. Because it's something everyone in town made together. It's even more so because everyone's feelings are in it.
U-Uh... yeah.
What's wrong, Shiona? Did something happen?
Shiona has been somewhat distant since a while ago.
No. Nothing's wrong.
Is that so...? I feel like something's different...
More importantly, Ray, it's cloudier than usual today, and my heart is turning gray.
Shiona muttered that while looking up at the sky.
I looked up at the sky in the same way, but I couldn't tell the difference from usual.
Rather, since it's after the rain, the dust in the air has settled, and I feel somewhat easier to breathe.
And it's humid, making my feelings bumpy. So, Ray. How about we relax at home today? Let's get fluffy with orange soup.
Does this air feel uncomfortable for Shiona...?
No, I think Shiona's words are probably hiding what she really wants to say.
But I didn't really understand what that meant.
I don't think Shiona would be mean.
But we went to the trouble of making it together. I want to show Mad-san his son's movie quickly.
Right... That's right.
Shiona fell silent after that.
She wasn't angry.
She was walking beside me, matching my pace.
I could see a hint of shadow in her expression.
We arrived at Mad-san's shop and stepped into the dim interior.
Hey... Why are you coming in without permission?
Mad-san's voice, like a rumble, came from the back of the shop.
He was leaning back in his chair, staring straight at us.
Hello, Mad-san. Um... this.
I took out the patched-up projector.
Mad-san glared at it as if appraising its value.
What is that? We don't buy garbage here.
That's not it. This, it looks bad, but it's a projector that can play your son's movie.
My son's movie? I don't remember asking you to make something like that.
You certainly didn't ask. It's something I did on my own. But various people in town cooperated to make this. Everyone wants you to see the movie, Mad-san.
That's why I said I don't remember asking for something like that.
I know. It's something I did on my own. So what I'm going to do now is also something I'm doing on my own. Stop me if you want to stop me.
I started to step forward.
But from behind, Shiona pulled on my sleeve and stopped me.
Ray, Mad-san is prickly and purple... It's better to stop today. Let's do it another day?
Shiona, we've come all this way. Even though Mad-san says that, he must want to see his son's movie. If we don't watch it here, we probably won't ever see it.
Besides, if he really hated it, I would have been thrown outside by now.
It's just a guess based on Mad-san's actions so far, but I don't think I'm wrong.
It's okay, Shiona. So don't make such a worried face. It's okay.
I nodded strongly, as if to dispel Shiona's anxiety.
...Okay, Ray. If that's what you want to do, then do as you please.
Shiona let go of my sleeve.
I started walking again.
I placed the equipment on the cash register counter and closed the shop door.
Next, I closed all the curtains on the windows.
The already dim shop became even darker.
It was just the right darkness for playing a movie.
And when I turned on the projector, which I had just charged, the fan whirred and after a while, the light I had attached turned on.
A square light appeared on the shop wall.
I adjusted the lens I received from the photo studio director and focused it.
Mad-san just stared intently at the action.
Mad-san, I'm going to play the movie now. Is that okay?
...Do as you please.
Mad-san didn't deny it.
I was sure that was the answer Mad-san wanted.
I placed my finger on the button of the control panel...
──Play.
Mad-san stared at the square light with a stern expression.
Within the light, the story began.
It was the story of a young boy.
The setting was an era when the sky was still blue and nature remained.
Born in a small house in a small town, he didn't know his mother.
The father he lived with only took minimal care of him... it was a relationship that could hardly be called a family.
And as the boy grew, the gap between them deepened.
They fought whenever they met.
Their short conversations were all denials of each other.
Before long, their gazes no longer met.
The boy started returning home less often, and eventually stepped onto the path of evil.
His father silently hit him.
With the wrinkles between his eyebrows etched deeper than usual...
The boy ran out of the house and left the town.
But that was the beginning of harsh days.
He was conveniently used and betrayed by those he thought were his friends, and his body and mind became worn out.
The one who supported him was a woman.
His encounter with her was something that would lead him to the right path.
The boy washed his hands of bad things and decided to move to a new town and start his life over.
──He had a family.
He had a son, and he believed without a doubt that he would live happily ever after with his beloved wife.
But... the woman passed away from illness.
He didn't have time to despair.
He worked desperately to raise the child left behind.
However, he was so desperate to work that he didn't notice the gap that was forming in his relationship with his child.
They only fought when they opened their mouths.
Days of misunderstanding continued.
And the grown-up child, as if to spite him, stepped onto the path of evil...
He thought it was a punishment.
He thought, 'Isn't this exactly what I did to my father?'
Now, he cursed his immature self.
He thought about how to stop his son and looked at his hands.
If he opened his hands, he might be able to gently reason with his son by stroking his head and hugging him.
If he clenched his hands, they would become fists, and he might be able to sternly admonish his son.
As a father, which should he choose?
──He clenched his fist.
The fist that had hit his son was hot, his chest ached as if it were being squeezed... and deep wrinkles were etched between his eyebrows.
But his son, holding his red and swollen cheek, shed tears.
He said that his father had properly scolded him, and that he was loved...
Hearing those words, he also shed tears.
Why hadn't he realized what his son had realized back then?
That the look on his father's face after hitting him wasn't anger, but sorrow.
He took his son and returned to the town where he was born, after 20 years.
The townscape was almost unchanged from when he had left.
And his small childhood home was also unchanged.
However, his father, who lived alone in that house, looked a size smaller than in his memory, perhaps due to old age.
He stood before his father, biting his lip and shedding tears.
His father silently patted his shoulder lightly and muttered just one word.
Mad-san's son's movie was a very old-fashioned human drama.
I don't know if this is interesting.
If my emotional function were normal, perhaps I could have judged.
But Mad-san was engrossed in the screen.
He watched the movie in silence from beginning to end.
The credits finished rolling, and the screen turned completely black.
It seems to be over.
Shiona looked at me once, then reached out her finger to the projector's stop button.
The moment her slender fingertip was about to touch the button, I grabbed Shiona's hand.
...? Ray?
Shiona looked at me with a puzzled expression. But I was staring at the screen.
The screen that had been completely black. In the center of it, text slowly appeared.
The text was probably handwritten; it contained clear "emotion."
'To my father, this movie is dedicated.'
The text slowly melted into the darkening screen and disappeared.
This time, the movie quietly came to an end.
Silence fell over the area.
Even after I turned off the power, Mad-san was still just staring intently at the place where the screen had been.
Mad-san... the movie is over now?
A sigh was the reply to my words.
...It was a boring movie.
He muttered that in a small voice, something unthinkable from the Mad-san up until now.
It was so boring, I got tired of holding back my yawns.
He wiped away the tears that had accumulated from the yawns he had been holding back, as if discarding them, then stood up from the chair and took the chip out of the projector.
Then he sat back down in the chair, gripping it tightly in his palm.
...Just hurry up and go home.
He said that in a voice with little intonation, then closed his eyes as if contemplating something.
Perhaps his son's feelings weren't conveyed in this movie?
Was it a movie that didn't matter to Mad-san...?
Then, what I did was──
My chest tightened, and I hurriedly called out to Mad-san, thinking I had to say something.
But Shiona lightly pulled on my clothes, interrupting me.
Ray, it's okay.
Shiona smiled, lowering the corners of her eyebrows.
Mad-san, he's just not being honest. Let's leave him alone for now, okay?
Not being honest...?
So, everything Mad-san said just now meant the opposite?
Mad-san is very smooth right now. He's filled with a beautiful light blue. It's thanks to Ray.
Is that so...? If that were the case...
I feel warmth deep in my chest.
I know this emotion.
It's the emotion called 'joy'.
I'm happy that I was able to make Mad-san happy.
I'm incredibly happy that I was able to be of help.
We quietly left the shop so as not to disturb Mad-san.
Leaving the projector there so he could watch movies again, whenever he liked.
When we got outside the shop, we could see a faint orange light beyond the sky.
It was a color as if reflecting my feelings.
I'm really glad Mad-san was happy.
Yes, that's right.
But her smile was somehow sad.
Huh? What is?
You look a little sad.
Do I? That's not true. Mad-san was happy, so my heart is perfectly round.
Is that so? Well, that's good then.
Hey, Ray. How about we have a feast today?
A feast? Why?
Because it's the anniversary of Ray making Mad-san happy.
An anniversary... Yeah, it's an anniversary.
Let's make orange soup and be all fluffy today, okay?
Yeah, let's do that. I'll help with the cooking too.
Thank you. I'm very happy, Ray.
Shiona's hand touches mine.
We held hands without either of us initiating it.
The warmth born in our joined hands.
The orange sky was eventually swallowed up by the creeping darkness of night.
The next day, as we had promised everyone who helped repair the projector, we decided to sing songs in the square.
Since we were going to, we wanted Mad-san to listen with us, so we visited Mad-san's shop.
But the door remained closed.
It was usually open by now, but a sign that said 'CLOSE' was hanging there.
The shop door was also locked, and we couldn't get inside.
I peeked into the shop through the gap in the door.
The projector was left on the counter.
Nothing had changed from yesterday.
The chair Mad-san was sitting in was right behind the shelf and I couldn't see it.
What's wrong, Mad-san? Maybe he's not feeling well?
...It turned out like this after all, huh?
Turned out like this...? What do you mean?
I tilted my head at Shiona, who spoke as if she knew the shop would be closed.
From the middle of the movie yesterday, Mad-san's bright red and prickly feeling disappeared.
Bright red and... prickly?
Yeah, I think he doesn't need to endure it anymore. That was the first time I saw Mad-san so calm.
Shiona smiled with a troubled look.
Was Mad-san enduring something all this time?
That's right. He actually wanted to make up with his son for a long, long time. He wanted to fly to his son's place. But Mad-san is always bright red and prickly, right? So he didn't have the chance.
Then, maybe the movie yesterday...?
That's right. Because Ray showed Mad-san his son's movie, Mad-san was able to be honest.
...Maybe Mad-san went to see his son?
Yeah. I think he left town.
Shiona smiled with a grin. Seeing that smile, I truly felt that I had been helpful to Mad-san.
My chest suddenly grew warm, and it came out of my mouth as words.
Amazing! You're amazing, Shiona! It turned out just like the movie! It was the father who went to see him, not the son, but it's almost exactly like the movie!
Yes, that's right. It's truly an amazing thing. But there's just one problem.
A problem?
Shiona's expression clouded over, and she let out a small sigh.
Could there be a problem when Mad-san and his son are making up?
I don't think Mad-san will be back for a while, so we won't be able to get the ingredients for the orange fluffy soup.
Shiona said that with a serious face.
That's... a problem, isn't it?
Yeah, it's a problem, right? But if we make it while saving the ingredients we have now, we'll be fine for a while.
Shiona relaxed her tight lips and smiled.
Seeing her like that, I felt my cheeks naturally move.
Something warm welled up from deep inside my chest.
I don't know what to call this feeling, but I feel very fulfilled.
I hope Mad-san comes back soon. I'd really like to hear his story. Maybe his son will come with him. That would be even better.
Yes, that's right. I hope that happens.
I felt that I was learning emotions little by little. I truly felt that.
I was getting closer to the image I had of myself.
I want to be even more helpful to people.
I want to learn even more emotions.
That feeling was the biggest driving force behind me.
Let's go, Ray. It's getting late.
That's right. Let's hurry. How many people can we make smile today?
Surely a lot. More than yesterday.
That's because Shiona's singing voice is beautiful.
No, it's because of Ray's performance.
Even though it's a performance, I'm just turning the handle.
That's important. When the person turning it has a kind heart, the music also feels warm and spreads out softly.
Shiona smiled, spreading her hands softly.
If it were just my singing, I'm sure no one would stop. My singing is only possible because of Ray's performance. Thank you, Ray.
My face suddenly felt hot.
Why is that, Shiona? My face is really hot.
Really. Your face has turned bright red. You must be embarrassed.
Embarrassed? Is this feeling embarrassment?
Yeah, Ray, you're surprisingly shy, aren't you? You're cute.
My face got even hotter after hearing Shiona's words.
After leaving Mad-san's shop, we visited the square.
Many people had already gathered there before we arrived.
We've been waiting for you two! Thanks again today!
My child has been saying 'Let's go listen to the song' since yesterday. Please do your best.
Your songs are healing. Thank you very much.
Big brother, big sister, sing again!
Everyone we met was waiting for our melody.
And everyone was smiling.
This was it.
What I had been searching for.
Doing something, making people happy, and being thanked.
This is what I wanted.
What a wonderful feeling.
How warm my chest feels.
I wanted to feel this sensation forever.
Shiona, let's start. Let's make everyone smile.
Yeah, of course.
I turned the music box handle just like yesterday.
The melody overflowed.
Shiona spun her melody to the sound.
And that melody spread a large circle of smiles.
Smiles spreading throughout the town.
More than anything, that made me happy.
And Shiona's profile as she sang happily was my joy.
The townspeople listened with smiles, just like yesterday.
The circle of smiles expanded.
Suddenly—I felt a slight discomfort in the hand turning the music box handle.
My right hand, wearing a glove to hide the mechanical hand.
I felt a slight creak in the hand turning the handle.
Hey, how was that machine from the day before yesterday?
While I was tidying up after the performance, someone spoke to me and I looked up.
There was the curator, and the townspeople who had provided the parts.
It played, and Mad-san was happy. It's all thanks to everyone.
Is that so? That's good. It was worth calling out to everyone.
It's truly thanks to all of you. Thank you very much.
No, it's fine... but you know, all of that happened because of your power.
Ah, that's right. Because of your actions, people came forward to cooperate like this.
But that's because everyone is kind. My actions were just the catalyst.
Of course, that's part of it. But you know, you won't know unless you act, and things won't change. It's not about who's the greatest or who's amazing. The person who acts first has that much value.
Starting with the curator, everyone who cooperated had a warm smile on their face.
If anything else comes up, don't hesitate to tell us. We'll cooperate as much as we can.
Saying that, the curator and the others scattered and left.
Watching their backs, I thought.
Hey, Shiona.
What is it, Ray?
As expected, I want to make even more people happy.
Making people happy is truly a wonderful thing.
Yes, that's right. But being able to think that way is a wonderful thing, Ray.
Shiona praised me, and I felt a little happy.
I could feel the warmth spreading gently in my chest.
So, I want to help and be useful to various people. I want to meet more and more different people and help them solve their worries and troubles.
If that's what you want to do, Ray, I think it's good to do that.
Then, Shiona, let's go look! Let's go help the people in this town who are in trouble!
...Wait.
You know, Ray, I think that's a little different.
I was sure Shiona would agree.
But she shook her head with a troubled look in her eyes.
Certainly, helping people is a wonderful thing. But you know, I don't think it's right to force it on them.
Force it...? I don't mean to do anything like that?
Of course, I understand how you feel, Ray. But you know, people have walls and problems they have to overcome on their own. If you help them with everything, they won't be able to grow. Of course, helping them is important, but first, they have to try their best themselves, and only when they can't handle it on their own, is help truly needed. So, Ray, let's help someone when they ask for help. It's not too late to help then.
I understood what Shiona was saying.
I was able to understand.
But deep down in my chest, I felt something bothering me.
Why do I have to suppress the feeling of wanting to help people?
Why can't I help people on my own initiative?
Why, why, why...?
At that point, I stopped thinking.
Because Shiona's smile seemed somehow sad.
A few days later.
The discomfort returned again.
It was the discomfort in my right hand that I felt when I was turning the music box.
A small sensation that I couldn't put into words.
But it was definitely affecting my right hand.
That discomfort was gradually getting bigger.
After returning to Shiona's house, I tried moving my fingertips one by one in my room.
Then, I found that none of my fingers would bend any further once they reached a certain depth.
With this, I can't grasp things.
This is a problem that will interfere with daily life.
No matter how many times I tried, the malfunction wouldn't fix itself.
Perhaps a fundamental repair, like disassembling it once, is necessary.
I have an idea of the cause of this malfunction—
It was when I was looking for that projector.
I pushed myself too hard in that garbage dump.
I felt a strange sensation when I was moving heavy things.
Let's go to that abandoned factory later today.
And let's go look for tools for the repair.
Ray, it's time for dinner.
Shiona suddenly came into the room.
I quickly put on my glove and hid my exposed right hand.
What's wrong? Why are you in such a hurry?
It's nothing. I was just spacing out, so I was surprised.
Did I surprise you? I'm sorry about that. I'll knock from now on.
Yeah, thank you. That would be helpful.
Yes, I understand. So, dinner is ready, do you want to eat now?
I looked at the clock.
Before I knew it, the hands of the clock had already passed the top.
It was already this late...
It's been cloudy outside, hasn't it? You lose track of time.
Yeah, I'll be right there. Will you wait for me?
Yes, I understand. I'll be waiting in the kitchen, Ray.
Shiona smiled brightly and left the room.
I took off my glove again and checked my right hand.
...Somehow, I have to make sure Shiona doesn't find out.
Even if I go to the abandoned factory, it will be after I eat.
I made up my mind and headed to the kitchen.
In the kitchen, Shiona's homemade dishes were lined up.
Ray, take a seat. Let's eat.
Shiona clasped her hands in front of her face.
I clasped my hands together in the same way.
Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
These words that Shiona taught me.
Before I knew it, I had started praying in the same way.
That's how much time I've spent with Shiona.
Thinking that, the depths of my chest naturally warmed up.
Hmm? No, it's nothing in particular.
Is that so? You look happy, you know? You're all fluffy and orange.
Happy face? Me...?
Yes, very, very much. Ray, you've started making that expression often lately. Somehow, I'm happy too.
Does that mean I'm... 'smiling'?
Yes, that's right. At first, you didn't smile at all, but lately you've started smiling a lot. I'm happy about that.
I'm... smiling...?
I remember the first day I woke up.
On that day, the face I saw was expressionless.
From that day on, I kept wishing.
I want emotions, I thought.
Before I knew it, it seems I've started to gain what I desired.
I felt a lightness in the depths of my chest, thinking it was good.
With this, I can stay with Shiona and the others forever.
I looked down at my right hand.
With this hand, hanging limply and without strength, I can't use a spoon properly.
Reluctantly, I switched to my left hand and scooped up the soup.
Eating with my unaccustomed left hand was extremely difficult.
What's wrong, Ray...? Huh, are you left-handed, Ray?
No... I'm right-handed, but my right hand hurts today for some reason.
It hurts? Oh no! We have to call a doctor... Ah, but there isn't one in this town, so we have to call one from a town far away...
No, it's okay. It'll heal if I leave it alone.
This is bad... This is bad.
If a doctor sees me, my true identity will be revealed.
I have to avoid that at all costs.
I want to stay here forever.
It's probably because I pushed myself too hard the other day. Working so hard in the rain...
...Yeah, I think that's probably why.
See, that's what happens when you don't stop when I tell you to. I'm worried about your body, Ray.
Yeah, thank you. But thanks to that effort, I'm glad Mr. Mad was pleased.
Yes, that's right. But you mustn't overdo it.
Shiona looked at me with a worried face.
I won't do anything that would make her look like that again.
Seeing Shiona's face other than a smile makes my heart turn blue.
Speaking of which, has Mr. Mad returned? Have you heard from him since then?
Not yet. His son lives a bit far away. I'm sure he hasn't arrived yet.
I see. I hope you hear from him soon.
Yeah, I hope so.
After that, Shiona didn't ask about my right hand.
I finished my meal quickly with my unaccustomed left hand.
Then I returned to my room and started getting ready.
I packed tools into my bag.
Most likely, I'll have to disassemble my own arm.
I need to solve this by myself.
I can't rely on anyone.
That's why I prepared meticulously.
As I was concentrating on preparing, I heard a knock on the door.
Immediately after, Shiona came into the room.
Ray, would you like to go shopping...? Are you going somewhere?
Shiona asked, looking back and forth between the bag and me.
Yeah. I'm just looking for something.
Where are you going? Close? Far? When will you be back?
I'm going to the abandoned factory. I'm planning to come back as soon as possible.
Abandoned factory? What are you going there for?
Um... Actually, the curator of the photo studio asked me for some parts, so I'm going to look for them.
It was a lie.
It was a clumsy lie, but Shiona smiled at me.
I see... Okay. Please be really careful, okay? Your right hand isn't doing well as it is, right?
Yeah, thank you. I'll try to come back as soon as possible.
I left the church, seen off by Shiona.
My destination was the abandoned factory—
But before that, there was a place I had to stop by.
I needed to cover up the lie I had blurted out on the spur of the moment.
If by any chance Shiona met the curator and mentioned my story, the lie would be exposed.
If that happened, I would hurt Shiona.
I don't want to hurt Shiona.
That's why my feet had taken me to the photo studio.
Oh, what a rare visitor.
When I opened the door, the curator, who was polishing a camera, welcomed me.
Excuse me for dropping by so suddenly.
No, it's fine... I was just about to head to your place.
My place...? The church? Did you need something?
Ah, just wait a moment.
The curator went into the back.
While waiting, I decided to look around at the photos on display.
There were various photos displayed, from old ones to recent ones.
The years they were taken, the locations, and the people were different.
But there was one thing they all had in common.
That was, everyone was smiling the same way.
I couldn't help but envy the people in those photos who were smiling.
Well, well, sorry to keep you waiting. Here, this is it.
The curator handed me a photo.
In it, Shiona was smiling and I was expressionless.
It's a photo I took before. It took some time to develop. I apologize for the delay.
Not at all. Thank you. But I don't have any money...
It's fine. It was delayed, and I took it because I wanted to. I'll make it a service.
Thank you. I'll give it to Shiona.
Please do. By the way, looking at it like this, you really do resemble Shiona's older brother.
You know about Shiona's older brother?
Ah, of course. Have you ever seen a photo of you and Shiona's brother standing side by side?
Yes, I have. It's the photo where he's holding a music box, right?
Ah, that's the one. Actually, I took that one.
Is that so...? When did your brother go on his journey?
It was right after that photo was taken, I think. He said he was going to spread music throughout the world. Shiona was so sad, you know. She's always smiling like that, but at that time, she cried and cried.
Shiona? I can't believe it...
...But you know, lately she's been smiling a lot. As much as when her brother was here... No, maybe even more.
Is that so? Certainly, I think she's always smiling.
I'm sure it's because you're here.
I think it's partly because you resemble her brother, but I don't think that's all there is to it.
But I haven't done anything for Shiona.
Making someone smile isn't just about doing something for them. You can also make them smile just by being close, by being by their side.
Being by her side... If that's the case, I'm confident I'm by Shiona's side more than anyone else.
I can see that from my perspective too. When Shiona is with you, it seems like she's showing a smile from her heart.
Those words warmed my heart.
I am connected to Shiona's smile.
Because I am here, Shiona is—
It's strange for me to ask, but will you stay close to Shiona always?
Of course. I will always, always be by Shiona's side and keep making her smile. That is my greatest wish.
Hahahahaha, it's like a proposal. It's a shame Shiona isn't here.
Pro...posal...?
Hearing those words, I felt my face get hot.
I know the meaning of the word.
It's a word where human men and women pledge to spend their lives together.
Did what I just said mean the same thing?
Thinking about that made my face get even hotter.
I turned my back to the curator so he wouldn't notice my agitation.
Um, well then, I have somewhere to go.
Is that so. Don't lose that photo.
Yes, thank you.
Saying my thanks over my shoulder, I left the photo studio.
The road to the abandoned factory.
I pushed forward across the reddish-black ground.
The bag filled with tools was a heavy burden.
Inside the bag slung over my shoulder, I could hear the tools rubbing against each other.
The wind was strong, and it looked like it would rain at any moment.
If I went to repair something and ended up causing more damage, it would be counterproductive.
To avoid the rain, I decided to hurry to the abandoned factory.
On the way there.
In the distance, I saw something white shimmering.
However, the location was too far away, and I had no way to confirm what the object was.
I couldn't even tell how big it was yet, but the white object also seemed to be slowly approaching me.
I strained my eyes and tried to confirm it.
At that moment, a gust of wind blew.
Involuntarily, I closed my eyes.
When I opened my eyes again, the white object had vanished from sight.
What on earth was that just now...?
For a while, I stood rooted to the spot.
But I couldn't stay like this.
The weather was getting increasingly suspicious.
I had to get to the abandoned factory quickly.
By the time the clouds turned dark, looking like rain would start any moment, I reached the abandoned factory.
Inside, it was as dusty as ever, filled with the smell of oxidized oil.
Immediately, I found a nearby workbench and decided to take off the glove on my right hand.
I was already used to the exposed parts.
First, I decided to try slowly opening and closing my fingers.
The malfunction wasn't fixed, and the movement stopped halfway.
What could be the cause?
I took out the light from my bag, shone it on my arm, and peered inside.
It didn't seem like there was any foreign object caught inside.
...In that case, it must be a problem with the internal parts themselves.
I took out my tools and began to disassemble my right hand.
I felt a sense of unease as I took apart my own hand.
I am currently breaking myself.
If I were to disassemble all of this, would I break?
Would that be my 'death'?
What would that feel like, I wonder?
If I died, where would this consciousness disappear to?
And if I were put back together again, would this consciousness return?
Could that be called living?
While thinking such things in the back of my mind as I disassembled, I reached the cause of the malfunction.
The piston rod of the cylinder that supplied oil to the finger was bent, and oil was seeping out.
It was a part I had removed once when I fixed Shiona's music box.
At that time, I used the oil from inside the cylinder to help the music box gears mesh smoothly.
It was a small amount of oil, but it must have been the necessary amount for the prosthetic finger part, which repeats precise movements.
Does this mean that even small flaws, when accumulated, become a large wound?
However, with the rod bent this much, even if I fix it halfway, the oil leak might reoccur.
The most certain way would be to replace this part entirely with a new one.
I stood up and decided to search the area.
Parts of unfinished Philoids were scattered on the floor.
Here in the Philoid factory, there must be parts that fit my model lying around.
With my right arm still disassembled, I searched inside the factory.
Many arm, leg, and torso parts were scattered throughout the factory.
The head parts were so elaborately made that you might mistake them for real ones if you weren't careful for a moment.
From among them, I searched for something that fit me.
Looking at my exposed right arm, I confirmed the model number of the part I needed.
That seemed to be the model number of the necessary part.
I searched for the same model number among the scattered arm parts.
Was I using something very rare?
Even after examining the parts scattered throughout the factory, there were no parts with the same model number.
The state of decay in this factory is much more advanced compared to the place where I woke up.
It's clear that this facility was abandoned a long, long time ago.
In that case, it makes sense that the manufacturing era is different and there are no parts with the same model number.
While feeling impatient, I continued searching for parts and discovered something marked 'AR115'.
Its appearance was extremely similar in shape to the part that was fitted into my arm.
However, the piston rod and shaft part were slightly longer.
With this, it seems I can replace it with just a little processing.
I placed the arm with 'AR115' attached onto the workbench and disassembled it.
After successfully taking out the part, I compared it to the part that was originally fitted into me—'HR114'.
It seems that an output terminal that didn't exist in 'HR114' has been added to 'AR115'.
There were no other changes.
Immediately, I tried attaching that part to my arm.
Unlike when disassembling, the attachment process was a bit difficult.
Even though I dropped the screws many times, I somehow finished the attachment.
When I tried moving my fingers, I was able to open and close them just like before.
However, each time, the discordant sound of machinery rubbing together echoed around.
It seemed the lubricant had run out.
Seeking oil, I proceeded deeper into the factory.
As the smell of oxidized oil grew stronger, I reached some dark, rusty drums.
When I opened them, they were all oxidized and unusable.
But in the very back, I found a relatively new drum.
When I opened it, there was a small amount of oil inside that was less oxidized.
I scooped the oil with the oil storage tank installed inside my arm.
Then, I returned the tank to its original location.
After a while, the oil was automatically extracted, improving the smoothness of the mechanical parts.
When I tried moving them, I was able to open and close my fingers without the discordant sound.
I was able to fix it.
Looking at my smoothly moving fingertips, I felt a sense of clarity spreading through my chest.
After putting my gloves back on, I returned my tools to my bag and left the factory.
Outside, the wind had become quite strong.
I hope it doesn't rain...
I hurried back towards the town.
--On the way.
A white object had fallen to the ground.
It was fluttering as if being toyed with by the blowing wind.
After watching it for a while, I realized it was a cape.
With one of its flutters, I saw what was wrapped inside.
It was in the shape of a person.
Thinking, "No way," I rushed towards it, knelt down, and gently lifted the cape.
There was a young man who was severely injured.
Blood flowing from his injured arm--I immediately knew he was a Human.
"A-Are you alright?!"
"Ugh... ugh..."
As if reacting to my voice, the young man let out a groan.
His body was painfully injured, and it didn't seem like he was in a condition to stand up.
There were marks at the young man's feet, as if he had crawled.
Blood was attached to those marks, telling the story of his hardship.
--I have to help him.
Something like a sense of mission seeped from within my chest throughout my body.
"Hang in there, are you alright!"
I threw the bag I had on my shoulder to the ground and helped the young man sit up.
Perhaps because the movement caused him pain, the young man made a pained expression and groaned even louder.
And as if clinging to something, he reached out his hand.
I instinctively offered my open right hand.
Through the glove, he gripped my mechanical hand.
"Damn it," I bit my lip in my heart.
But the strength in his hand was so weak that I couldn't shake him off.
The young man slowly opened his eyes and looked at me.
"Y-You..."
"A-Are you alright? There's a town nearby. I'll carry you there right away."
"T-Town..."
He muttered, as if repeating my words with vacant eyes.
And as if confirming the hand he was gripping, he traced the glove with his weak fingers.
He must have found out.
Through the glove, he must have noticed the hard texture, different from that of a Human.
But it doesn't matter.
This isn't a situation where I can worry about that.
"...Is... that town... where you... l-live...?"
"T-Town... live..."
The young man repeated "town" like a spell.
His voice was weak, as if it could disappear at any moment.
I decided to take the young man back with me.
Maybe, just maybe, I can save this person now.
I put my arm around his shoulder and dragged him along.
His steps were heavy, and it took a considerable amount of time to move even ten meters.
But I wanted to help this person so much... I was filled with the desire to save him.
"You... since when have you been in... town...?"
The man, who seemed about to lose consciousness, asked me.
"About a week."
"I see... I see..."
I could feel the young man weakening over my shoulder.
If he doesn't stay conscious, he might not come back.
"Hang in there, we'll be in town soon, very soon. It's not that big, but the people there are all warm."
I desperately spoke to the young man.
If I could talk about something that would interest him, he shouldn't lose consciousness.
"There's no doctor, but there are books, so I'm sure I can figure out how to treat his injuries."
"...B-Books...?"
"Yes! There's everything. You can look up anything. So please, hang in there."
"...A-Anything...?"
"Yes! I'm sure!"
The young man took a long, slow breath and whispered softly.
"...Leave me..."
I didn't understand what he said.
I stopped walking without thinking.
"...Leave me... just leave me here..."
"I-I can't do that!"
"I was... attacked by Humans..."
"By Humans...?"
"I was just... just traveling in search of an ideal... But an ideal is... a value system..."
The young man took another long breath.
"Because of differences in values... Humans... oppose each other, resent each other, fight... and become utterly cruel... and violent..."
"Th-That's not true, Humans are warm, they can share many things, they support each other--"
"Ah, that is exactly the ideal..."
The young man relaxed, as if exhaling all the air he had taken in.
"...Hey, p-please, hang in there! Hang in there!"
Did he just lose consciousness, or...?
Unpleasant thoughts swirled in my head.
I gritted my teeth, looked straight ahead, and started walking towards town.
To save this person even one second sooner.
Before I knew it, the rain began to fall, beating hard against our backs.
Rainwater seeped into my gloves, but this wasn't the time to worry about that.
I frantically carried the young man to the church.
"Ray, what... wh-who is that?!"
Shiona greeted me in a flustered manner.
"This person collapsed on the way! He's severely injured!"
"Okay. Carry him to the back."
Led by Shiona, I carried the young man to the room with the bed.
When I laid him on the white sheet, the rainwater and blood on his body mixed and spread into a red stain.
There was no sign of the young man regaining consciousness.
"Ray, I brought some water."
I held the cup Shiona gave me to the young man's mouth.
I poured in just a little water.
The young man's throat pulsed with a swallow.
Even so, he didn't regain consciousness.
Compared to when I met him, his face was considerably paler.
"Shiona, I'm going to the library! There must be medical books there!"
Shiona started to say something, then bit her lip.
I was worried about how she looked, but this was a situation where every second counted.
Ignoring Shiona, I rushed out of the room.
And without caring about getting wet in the rain, I ran to the library.
"Ray, what's wrong? You're all wet."
Perhaps surprised by me rushing in, Tippy's large eyes widened as she looked at me.
Ignoring my uneven breathing, I asked.
"Tippy... are there medical books... here?"
"U-Uh, yeah, there are."
"Please, can you show me right away?"
"...Okay."
She must have sensed something.
Tippy immediately guided me to the location.
"Is someone sick?"
On the way, Tippy asked, still facing forward.
"Yeah... he's injured."
"Ray? Shiona? Or...?"
"No, someone Tippy doesn't know. So, you don't have to look so sad."
"But... but, but..."
Large tears streamed down her cheeks.
That young man was someone Tippy didn't know.
And yet, and yet...
To be able to shed tears for that person, how kind of a child Tippy is.
"It's okay... It's okay."
I picked up Tippy and gently held her in both hands.
Her hot tears came through my clothes.
I could feel a small ache deep in my chest.
Enduring that pain, I rummaged through the medical books.
But no matter how many books we had, we were just amateurs.
We didn't even know what the symptoms were, what treatment to give, or which book was correct.
I carried back as many books as I could hold from the library.
Not caring that the books were getting wet, I returned to the church.
When I opened the door, a melody flowed out.
It was Shiona's singing melody.
Just by that singing voice, I could recognize that this was a sacred place.
"Shiona, how is he?"
"No... he hasn't woken up. I did what I could, but..."
I ran to the young man's side.
The bandages wrapped around him must have been Shiona's doing.
But the young man's face was even paler than before.
I roughly opened the medical books.
I flipped through the pages, searching for anything I could do.
But we were too reckless.
No matter how wonderful the medical books were, they were ultimately just stacks of paper.
There was no way we, without any skill, could save someone with medicine from the start.
We were too powerless, too insignificant.
Shiona began to sing quietly.
Unlike usual, it was a quiet melody, like a requiem.
...Mm... this song...
The young man opened his eyes at Shiona's song.
But his gaze was vacant, as if he might disappear at any moment.
Do you know this song?
Ah, it's a nostalgic song... I used to sing it often...
The young man's gaze traced the ceiling, then turned towards Shiona and me.
Suddenly, the young man's expression softened.
...Ah, it was here... here was the world I was searching for...
What do you mean? The world you were searching for, what in the world...
Perhaps the young man couldn't hear anymore, as he didn't answer my question.
He just continued speaking unilaterally.
...The path of coexistence... a world of harmony...
After saying that, the young man quietly closed his eyes.
And then, he didn't move a muscle.
I felt something spill from deep within my chest.
Hey Shiona, why isn't he opening his eyes? Is he sleeping?
The strength he had just a moment ago is draining away...
Hey, why is that... Is he just tired...?
An indescribable sense of loss hung heavily in the depths of my chest like a dark cloud.
Pain shot through me, as if my chest had been violently churned.
Shiona hugged me from behind.
Her warmth helped me calm down a little.
Naturally, I placed my hands over Shiona's hands wrapped around my chest.
Shiona... I, I...
Ray... let's hold a funeral for him.
A funeral...?
It's like a ceremony you do when someone dies.
When someone dies...
With those words, I understood.
Ah, this person has died.
That's the only way we can mourn the dead.
I stood there, unable to move, listening to Shiona's words.
I couldn't quite process the existence of death that had appeared before me.
Well then, I need to prepare, so will you help me?
I could only nod briefly.
We began preparing for the funeral.
To mourn this young man whose name we didn't even know.
As we prepared for the ceremony, there was one thing that kept bothering me.
I had left Tippy, who had been crying so much, at the library.
Was Tippy still crying?
In that dark library. All alone.
Ray, what's wrong?
Shiona spoke to me as my hands stopped while decorating the altar.
Yeah... there's something that's bothering me a little.
Something bothering you? What is it? Is it about that man?
No, not that... it's about Tippy.
Tippy-chan? What about Tippy-chan?
When I went to get the medical books, I told Tippy everything about that person. Then, Tippy started crying... and the terrible thing is, I just left Tippy at the library like that.
You turned pale and just left her there, didn't you?
Yeah, that's right. So, I was wondering if she's still crying...
...Yeah, maybe. I'm sure she's crying in the back of the library.
I could easily imagine that scene.
Thinking about that, I couldn't stand still.
Shiona, is it okay if I go check on Tippy for a bit?
Shiona showed a smile that looked a little sad.
We still have a little more preparation for the funeral. So, I'd be happy if you came back quickly.
Yeah, I know. I'll be right back.
...Okay. Go ahead.
Shiona still gave me a somewhat sad smile.
I finished decorating the altar and headed to the library.
Bringing the medical books I had borrowed.
I walked through the town, which had become a light drizzle, with an umbrella.
The appearance of the town was somehow different from usual.
As if something important was missing, something had been lost...
I ran through the town of loss, hurrying to the library.
Inside the library, silence enveloped everything, as if blocking out the sound of the rain.
--No, except for one thing.
Except for the sound of a blue girl's sobbing coming from the back.
I followed the sound of the girl's crying.
The girl was in her usual spot.
As usual, the girl was drawing a picture and shedding tears.
Ray... Ray...
Recognizing me, Tippy reached out her small hands.
As if in response, I hugged her small body.
As soon as I hugged her, her sobbing grew a little louder.
Ray... what happened to that person?
Her words choked me up.
Hey, Ray... Ray...
That person... hey... hey, hey...
My silence had become the answer.
Perhaps Tippy understood everything, and without holding back her sadness, she began to cry loudly.
Large tears rolled down her cheeks for the young man she had never met.
Ah, why is this happening?
What is this pain in my chest?
The depths of my chest are being churned up.
At times, it hurt my chest with pain.
Surely, it was something overflowing from the wound that had opened in my chest.
It had heat and was overflowing from my eyes.
Before I knew it, I was crying.
I was shedding tears for the death of the young man whose name I didn't even know.
Ah, I see.
This is 'sadness'.
It's a blue emotion.
It's the emotion that Tippy always carries in her heart.
It's this painful and difficult.
Tears that flow endlessly.
I don't know how to stop them.
--No, that's not right.
I didn't want to stop them.
I wanted to keep letting these overflowing hot drops flow.
Surely these drops are an act of healing sadness.
By letting the sadness accumulated deep in our hearts flow out, we maintain our sanity.
Thinking that, I felt the heaviness that had accumulated deep in my chest lighten a little.
And at the same time, I felt the amount of overflowing tears increase.
I cried.
We cried.
Sobbing, hugging each other, we cried.
Crying, crying, crying...
No matter how much time passed, the tears wouldn't dry up.
Just as sadness wouldn't wither, the tears continued to overflow.
Tippy, there's going to be a funeral soon.
...A funeral? What... is that?
It's a ceremony to say goodbye to someone who has passed away. Shiona is preparing it right now.
Goodbye...? What do you mean... goodbye?
It means you won't be able to see them anymore.
Won't be able to see them anymore... No!
Tippy clung to me tightly.
Her arms were trembling slightly.
I understand, Tippy, that feeling. But, I think it's precisely because it's sad that we have to say a proper goodbye.
Since we can't see them anymore, let's say goodbye and send them off. If we don't, I'm sure we'll be lonely and sad...
Lonely... sad...
Yeah, I'm sure that's right. So, let's send them off. So that we don't feel lonely and sad... Can you do that?
Tippy slowly pulled away from me.
She looked up at me with a face that hadn't stopped crying.
...I can. Tippy, I can.
Is that so? You're amazing, Tippy.
When I stroked her head, she looked a little happy.
But, her tears never stopped.
Alright then, let's go... Can you stand?
Yeah... Just a moment.
Tippy stood up and picked up her teddy bear.
The stuffed animal that was always with her was still in her arms.
We walked hand in hand towards the church in the rain.
Merciful Father, who is God, we entrust to your hands this young man who believed in your only begotten Son, whom you sent, and who has finished the journey of life in the hope of eternal life.
Remove all the burdens of this brother and sister who are leaving us, guide them to the dwelling prepared in heaven, and add them to the company of the saints.
May we, who are in the sorrow of separation, also be supported by the hope of resurrection promised by the Lord, and share eternal joy with the child called to you.
The church, where Shiona's voice echoed, was overflowing with attendees.
Not a single person there should have seen that young man.
Not a single person there should have known that young man.
Even so, everyone gathered here mourned the young man's death.
I thought, this is what it means to care for others, this is the connection between people.
Everyone clasped their hands in front of their chests, closed their eyes quietly, and offered a prayer.
Tippy and I followed suit.
Shiona's voice echoed solemnly throughout the church.
It almost sounded like a song she was dedicating to the young man...
After the funeral, the young man would be buried in the cemetery behind the church.
For a final farewell, everyone in town approached the coffin one by one and offered words of parting.
A good afterlife...
May we meet again someday...
Eternal rest...
They spoke whatever words came to mind.
Alright, Tippy.
It was our turn, and we approached the coffin.
Tippy stared intently at the coffin containing the young man.
The tears she had shown right before the funeral were gone, and she simply stared at the young man with a blank expression.
As if she had lost all emotion.
Just silently.
She just stared and stared at the coffin.
Seeing her like that, I felt uneasy and tried to call out to Tippy.
But, a moment before that, she opened her mouth.
She mumbled that in a small voice.
Several hours passed after that.
Through a break in the clouds where the rain had stopped, light, unusually, shone through.
It was rare for sunlight to shine through the gray, murky sky.
But, I wasn't captivated by the beautiful scenery.
Because I was worried about the expression Tippy had during the funeral.
That expression that was too empty to be called sadness.
I don't know what it meant.
Even so, there's only one thing I think.
I want to be by her side.
I want to be by Tippy's side and talk to her.
And, I want to heal that sadness for her.
That feeling grew within me.
As I was about to open the door to the room, Shiona called out to me.
Yeah, I was thinking of going to see Tippy.
Tippy looked really sad during the funeral, so I was worried.
I see... But you know, I'm worried about Ray.
Yeah. Because Ray, you have a really sad expression.
Sad...?
I touched my face with my hand.
You won't know that way, will you? Here, come here.
Pulled by the hand and brought into the living room, I was made to stand in front of the mirror.
See? You have a sad face, don't you?
My face reflected in the mirror was... blue.
I finally understood what Shiona always meant when she said Tippy was "blue."
Right now, I have the same face as Tippy.
Even though my heart is calm, the strength drains from my body, and my expression sinks as if pulled by gravity.
...Yeah, this is the first time I've seen my face like this.
This is... sadness.
Even without shedding tears, when you're trapped by this emotion, your expression becomes this "blue."
Someone passed away. It's natural to have a face like that.
How is this feeling... necessary for living...?
It's bitter... and painful..., heavy, and aching and cold...
I looked at Shiona's expression reflected in the mirror.
But, she showed a somewhat sad, fleeting smile.
I'm sure she's trying to be strong and smile.
Just thinking that made my chest ache a little.
Tippy-chan is important too. But you know, I want you to take care of yourself first.
Me... take care of myself?
Yeah, that's right. Ray taking care of Ray.
Taking care of myself... I've never thought about that.
Ray, you're kind, aren't you? That's why you probably prioritize other people over yourself.
But, that's what I want to do.
I'm a little sad about that. I don't want Ray to push himself.
I'm not pushing myself.
Is that so? I don't think so.
Shiona's arm intertwined with mine.
...I'm worried, you know.
I felt my heart rate increase.
I don't know what it is.
But it was definitely stirring my emotions.
In that warmth, I felt kindness.
...No, more than kindness... I feel a different kind of warmth, different from the touch on my skin.
Hey Ray, how about some tea?
...Tea? Why?
When you drink something warm and fluffy, your heart becomes fluffy too. It's really nice, relaxing both your mind and body.
But Tippy is...
Tippy-chan is probably upset because someone passed away. But you know, I'm sure she can overcome it. For that, let's leave her alone for a little while. Being alone is very important, you know?
Is that so?
Yes, I'm sure it is. Because if you don't, you can't become strong.
People, you know, can become strong by overcoming walls and sadness. But if someone helps them every time, they won't grow much. To help Tippy-chan grow, let's leave her alone today?
Tippy is a weak being.
She's always crying.
But, if you say it's a chance to grow...
I'll accept that.
Shiona, will you make some tea?
Of course. Will you sit and wait for me?
I sat on the sofa and waited for Shiona's tea.
After waiting for a while, a pleasant aroma filled the room.
Thank you for waiting. It's my special, heartwarming tea. Please enjoy.
The teacup offered to me was filled with an orange-colored drink.
A faint acidity and a subtle sweetness in the aroma drifted.
Like this. It's been a while since we've talked slowly, Ray.
Yeah, you're right. A lot has happened...
Ray, how's your memory?
No, it doesn't seem to be coming back yet.
I see... But, there's no need to rush. You might suddenly remember something eventually.
Yeah, thank you... But you know, I feel bad.
Feel bad? About what?
I'm staying here as a freeloader, but I haven't been able to repay Shiona for her kindness at all, have I?
That's not true. I'm happy just having Ray by my side.
But that's not repaying the kindness at all.
That's not all. You also fixed the music box... and because of that, I was able to sing.
But you were singing even before that, weren't you, Shiona?
But you know, it's quite different with and without a melody. See, we played together in the square, right? Actually, I had sung in that spot many times.
In that spot... alone?
Yeah. But you know, at that time, no one would listen.
Even with such a wonderful singing voice? That's strange.
Hehehe, thank you. But you know, that's how it is. That's why I was so happy when Ray brought the music box with him.
That's... I was just winding the music box.
That's what makes me happy. Being by my side is what makes me happiest.
I feel the same way. I'm happy to be with Shiona.
...Hehe. Thank you. Ray, your emotions have become very rich.
Emotions? Me?
Yes. Your expressions are much richer than when we first met.
That was what I sought and desired.
It was what I had craved ever since I woke up.
By being told by Shiona, my heart is filled.
Because she told me that I, who was incomplete, was getting closer to being a human... to Shiona.
I'm sure that's because Shiona was smiling by my side.
Is that so? I didn't do anything.
No, it's because Shiona was here. Thank you, I'm grateful.
If you're going to say that, then so am I. Ray, thank you.
I'm the one who should say thank you.
I'm the one who... Hehe, that's funny. For the two of us to keep thanking each other.
That's true. What are we doing, I wonder?
...But you know, it's strange.
What's strange?
I wish this time could last forever, that's what I'm thinking... Isn't that strange?
...No, not at all. Because I was thinking the same thing...
...Can I come over there?
Shiona sat down next to me.
A distance where warmth is conveyed.
We were at the closest distance we had ever been.
Huh...? What is this...?
What's wrong?
Somehow, my body feels strange. My chest is... pounding.
Could it be that I've broken down? It would be troublesome if it's a serious breakdown requiring maintenance.
It's okay. I'm the same way. My chest has been pounding the whole time.
Huh? I-Is that okay? Does it hurt?
No. This is a wonderful thing.
Shiona gently and shyly placed her hand on mine.
Softly, as if enclosing it.
In response, I turned my wrist. As if to put our palms together... as if to intertwine our fingers.
I feel Shiona's warmth more strongly.
And that warmth is warming the depths of my chest.
The depths of my chest are warm, like, a gentle warmth...
My chest...? Here...?
Shiona's hand reached out to my chest.
The place she touched suddenly became hot.
Shiona's hand feels really hot... I wonder why. Could it be that I'm sick?
No, that's not it.
Do you know the reason, Shiona?
Yes, I think so.
Tell me.
Hehe, I wonder what I should do.
Don't be mean. I'm curious.
Hmm... but you know, this isn't just you, Ray.
Getting hot?
Yes, that's right. My chest is also very hot right now.
You're the same, Shiona?
Yes, the same. Maybe I'm more seriously ill than you.
That's terrible! How can it be cured?
No, it can't be cured... and it doesn't need to be cured.
The depths of my chest are hot, and it feels tight, and it's painful, and it's sad, but it's warm... and that's okay. That's good, Ray.
Shiona's hand, which was on mine, became a little warmer.
I squeezed her hand back.
Ray, please.
I want you to stay with me forever.
Yeah... forever and ever, stay with me?
Yeah... I promise.
Thank you, Ray. I'm so happy... so, so happy...
Shiona rested her head on my chest.
And I felt like my heart was being filled.
It was similar to the feeling of joy I had felt before, but it was a stronger emotion than that.
What do humans call this?
I wanted to ask Shiona, but I thought it would be tasteless to break this atmosphere.
So, just like this... I'll entrust myself to the time with Shiona like this.
The sweet-smelling tea prepared on the table. We stayed like that until the steam disappeared.
The next day, after finishing breakfast, I was getting ready to go out.
Shiona, who was washing the dishes, called out to me.
I was thinking of going to the library.
The library... Are you going to see Tippy-chan?
Yeah, that's the plan.
I'm sure Tippy-chan is still in the process of overcoming it. So, let's leave her alone, okay?
Yeah... but when I think about her being lonely by herself if she can't overcome it, I still can't just leave her.
Just like Shiona was by my side yesterday and made me feel warm, I think I can support her just by being nearby.
It's okay. Tippy-chan isn't that weak.
Is that... so...?
Yeah, I'm sure of it. More importantly, Ray, I have a favor to ask. Why don't we go to the square today?
To the square? Why?
With the music box... I was thinking of singing again.
Yeah, something sad happened, didn't it? So, it's important to rest your feelings too.
Rest my feelings...?
After the funeral, I think the townspeople are probably feeling down too. So, don't you want to brighten everyone's mood?
...Everyone in town? Of course, I do.
It's painful to see sad faces.
If I can, I hope I can heal that sadness.
That's what our melody can do. I'm sure the town will regain its energy.
Is that so... Is that right?
Yeah, I'm sure of it. Come on, let's get ready.
Prompted by Shiona, I reached for the music box.
The music box, which I maintain every day, is always ready to play music.
We set off for the square.
It was a cloudy afternoon.
There were hardly any people there.
There's no one here, Shiona.
It's always like this at this time. Before you came, Ray.
Before I came...?
I told you, didn't I? Since you started playing music, everyone has started listening to my songs. The townspeople are changing little by little. They're going out more, and interacting more. I feel like the connections between people are getting stronger, little by little.
Is it because I came...?
Yes, I think so. Since you came, the townspeople have changed. For the better, of course.
Those were very happy words.
I'm being useful to someone.
That fact makes my joy unstoppable.
You look happy, Ray.
Yeah. Your cheeks are relaxed.
My cheeks?
Yeah, look--
Shiona's fingertip poked my cheek.
Just that made me feel the depths of my chest warm up again.
My face feels kind of hot.
Are you blushing, Ray? Ahaha.
My face got even hotter.
It seems what Shiona was saying was spot on.
Well then, Ray, shall we begin?
Yeah, are you ready?
Anytime you are.
Shiona slowly closed her eyes.
I felt like I wanted to look at her beautiful profile forever.
But just as much, I also wanted to hear Shiona's singing voice.
So I slowly began to turn the handle of the music box.
Shiona's singing voice joined the melody.
The two melodies blended together and echoed a beautiful sound around us.
Soon, people started to gather.
At first, the people had somewhat gloomy faces, but gradually they regained their smiles.
And before long, a large circle of smiles had spread throughout the square.
Town Child A
Townsperson A
Townsperson B
Townsperson C
Townsperson D
Smiles and words from various people were flying around.
Ah, this is it.
This is what I was looking for.
People with happy smiles.
Every time I see those smiles, my joy increases.
I was sad that that girl wasn't in that circle.
The blue girl in the back of the library.
The girl who never visits here.
The girl who remains shut away in that library.
I couldn't stop thinking about that girl.
Shiona's voice brought me back to reality.
Sorry, I was thinking about something for a bit.
I see... Well, everyone's gone home now.
Looking around, the people who had formed such a large circle were now scattered.
It seemed I had been lost in thought for a very long time.
What were you thinking about?
Hmm... No... Nothing in particular...
Want me to guess? It's about Tipy-chan, right?
My thoughts were seen through so easily. So I nodded honestly.
...Yeah, that's right.
Just as I thought... Are you really that worried?
Yeah, I'm worried. Because she's still such a small child.
A small child, huh... That's true.
And she's always alone. There's no way she's not lonely.
But it's always been like that until now. She's used to it already.
That's not true.
Because, didn't Shiona say it too? That the townspeople changed after I came?
Yeah, that's right...
Then, I want Tipy to change too. It's not right for her to stay lonely.
I said, returning the words Shiona had taught me.
Receiving those words, Shiona's smile clouded over slightly.
She looked towards the library, tightened her mouth for a moment, then turned back to me and smiled.
Ray, shall we go home?
It's going to rain this afternoon. Come on, let's go home... okay? I'll make fluffy white soup.
Pulled by Shiona's hand, I was half-forcibly made to leave the square.
Then, a few hours later.
As I was about to leave the house, Shiona called out to me again.
Um, I was thinking I wanted to read a book...
If it's books, I have a few that my brother used to read.
Not those... Um, it's a genre of book that probably isn't here.
What kind of genre is it?
It's a book about machines. I got interested after repairing Mad-san's the other day.
Oh, I see. I'm happy that you're interested in something, Ray.
Yeah, thank you. So, I'm going to the library.
Does it have to be today?
Yeah, the sooner the better. I want to read it as soon as possible.
But it's going to rain soon?
The weather doesn't matter. I'll go even if it rains.
But the book might get wet?
It's okay, I'll bring a bag.
Hmm... In that case, I'll go and borrow it for you.
Huh? No, it's fine, I'll go myself.
No, it's fine. I had some shopping to do anyway, so I'll go while I'm at it.
Saying that, Shiona went back to her room.
Why is that?
I feel like Shiona is trying to keep me away from the library.
No, that's not right.
It would probably be more accurate to say she's trying to keep me away from Tipy.
I don't know what that means, but it seems to be true that she doesn't want us to meet.
Shiona said it calmly, but I could feel her feelings.
But why, exactly?
I'm ready, Ray. What kind of book should I borrow?
You probably won't understand if I tell you, so I'll go with you.
No, it's fine. You just relax, Ray.
Okay... Then, I'd like you to borrow a book with electronic circuits in it.
Electronic circuits, huh. Got it. Well then, I'll be going.
Shiona went out.
After waiting for a few minutes.
By now, Shiona should be out of sight.
I reached for the door that led outside.
...That's strange.
It wasn't locked.
But the door wouldn't open at all.
It was as if a bolt had been placed from the outside.
――Perhaps, that's exactly what happened.
When Shiona left, she put a lock on the outside that can only be locked from the outside, so I wouldn't notice.
That's why I can't get out through this door.
――But why?
――What for?
I went back to the living room, holding my head.
When I looked at the table, a piece of paper had been placed there without me noticing.
It was a note from Shiona.
To Ray,
You must have been surprised that the door was locked.
Do you remember me telling you that a nearby town was attacked?
So, I locked the door as a precaution.
Please stay home and look after the place.
I've prepared soup and bread for your meal.
Please warm it up before you eat.
Absolutely do not go outside.
I also heard about the humans who repeatedly looted from that young man who passed away.
Perhaps those humans are coming near here.
If that's the case, it's dangerous to go outside.
I see. Shiona was worried about me.
But if that's the case, it would be dangerous for Shiona to go outside too.
Shouldn't I, as a man, have been the one to go shopping?
──I shouldn't deceive myself...
It's true that there are humans who loot.
Even so, is it necessary to lock the door from the outside?
Rather, if it's locked from the outside, the key can only be opened from the outside.
Entering the house becomes easy.
――Something's wrong.
If she was really wary of humans who loot, she wouldn't have sung a song in the square yesterday.
She wouldn't have done something that specifically gathered people.
If that's the case, then why?
――There's only one thing I can think of.
She locked me in.
To keep me away from Tipy.
Shiona wouldn't do something like this without thinking.
There must be a reason.
And it must be something she did for me.
...Could something have happened to Tipy?
Could she be trying to keep me from knowing about it?
Something bad for me... so that I wouldn't be sad knowing about it...
I couldn't stand still.
I want to see Tipy. I want to confirm.
The blue girl crying alone in the library.
I wanted to wipe away that girl's tears.
I looked around the inside of the church.
There was a window in a very high position.
Even if I could climb up, there's no guarantee I could get out and descend safely.
But that's the only way out of here.
Suddenly, I noticed some white cloth.
Curtains swaying in the wind.
There were many of them in the room, long and large to cover the big windows, and they looked sturdy.
I took down the curtains from all the windows.
From the sky covered by dark clouds, there was no sign of sunlight pouring down.
When I tied the five curtains together on the table, they became quite long.
It was long enough to descend to the first floor.
I tied the end of the curtains to the window bars.
I wrapped it around multiple times and checked the strength repeatedly.
It's okay.
It should be able to support my weight alone.
I tied the other end of the curtain to myself.
And with resolve, I leaned my body out of the window.
The ground visible from there looked very far away.
I felt a little lightheaded, but I couldn't back down now.
Clutching the curtains, I slowly lowered my body.
Midway, a strong wind shook me.
As my body swung like a pendulum, I could only cling to the curtains with all my might.
After waiting a few minutes for the wind to stop.
I took a deep breath once and resumed the task of lowering my body.
It probably took about ten minutes until my feet finally reached the ground.
My body was so exhausted that I almost fell on my butt right there.
But I didn't have time to rest here.
I started walking towards the library where the blue girl was waiting.
As if to hinder my thoughts, the rain began to fall quietly.
As if to moisten the dry town, its intensity gradually increased.
Without an umbrella, I walked on, not minding getting wet.
My wet clothes clung to my skin, making me feel uncomfortable.
I tried to shield my right hand, which was covered by a glove, from the rain.
Puddles began to form under my feet, and I started to hear distant thunder.
My rough breaths occasionally carried rainwater into my mouth.
In contrast to my warming body, the cold rain beat down from outside.
Spitting out the rusty-tasting rain, I finally arrived.
At that library where the blue girl waited alone.
It was dimly lit inside, and no light leaked out at all.
Is that child buried alone in that dark sea of books again?
Just thinking about that made my chest ache terribly deep down.
I entered the entrance and proceeded deep inside, where the blue girl was waiting.
"You came..."
A voice reached me from the back.
It wasn't Tipy's.
The very person who had been keeping me away from here—.
"I wrote in the note that you shouldn't go outside because it's dangerous, didn't I? Maybe you didn't see it?"
"No, I saw it."
"I see... Then you came knowing. Ray is a bad boy."
Hehe, I heard Shiona's laugh.
But her expression was hard to see in the dimly lit building.
"Why did you lock me up?"
"Lock you up...? But, that's what ended up happening, didn't it? I'm sorry."
"There must be a reason, right? Would you tell me if you don't mind?"
"...A reason? The reason is simple. I don't want you to meet her."
"You don't want me to meet her...?"
"The blue girl who is further inside."
"Tipy? Why?"
"I can't tell you. It's top secret."
"Wait, I don't understand what you're saying. Why can't I meet Tipy?"
"That's... because you can't."
"That's not a reason! Tell me properly!"
"I can't tell you the reason."
My tone of voice became strong without thinking.
At the same time, I realized that the inside of my chest was burning red and hot.
Is this "anger"?
Am I feeling angry towards Shiona...?
That's not my intention. I just want her to tell me the truth.
But my words just now seemed to have unsettled Shiona.
Although I couldn't see her expression clearly in the dark, the atmosphere emanating from her changed.
An air filled with hesitation, as if she was faltering to say something.
Shiona opened her mouth slightly, about to say something... but closed it again after all.
Then, pulling her chin down as if looking down, she whispered her words.
"...Because you'll be unhappy."
"Unhappy? Who?"
"...Both Ray and I... and everyone living in this town, I guess."
"The townspeople? By us meeting? I don't understand what you're saying."
"Certainly, you might not understand now. But you'll definitely regret it."
"Why will I regret it? Hey Shiona, tell me clearly. I'm not smart, so I don't understand. If you don't tell me clearly..."
"In other words, it's like this..."
The sound of boots.
Shiona approached me in the dimly lit entrance.
What I felt the next moment was warmth.
And softness.
Shiona was hugging me.
"Shiona... Huh? W-What..."
"Please, Ray... Let's go home together just like this?"
"Just like this...? What do you mean?"
"It's really not good for Ray and Tipy-chan to meet. To be precise, if you meet, a chain of bad things will happen. So..."
"Maybe I made Tipy angry? Is that why she doesn't want to meet me, or something like that?"
"No, the opposite. Tipy-chan loves Ray very much."
"Then—"
"That's why you can't meet her. Please understand."
Shiona's arms around my waist tightened.
A sweet scent enveloped my whole body, and my head felt light.
"...Is that, Shiona's wish?"
"Yes, it is. It's my heartfelt wish."
"If I meet Tipy, how will Shiona feel?"
"Very, very sad. I think I'll feel blue and prickly."
"Why? Why do you feel that way, Shiona?"
Shiona pulled her face away from mine, looked up at me...
And said, as if making a decision.
"Ray... Because I like you."
"L... like...?"
At those words, my thoughts almost stopped.
Sweet breath.
Lips that seemed about to touch.
The hand around my waist.
Touching body heat.
We were incredibly close.
And then, those words just now.
Even though they were just two letters put together, they contained such deep emotion.
These words filled my chest with incredible speed.
I felt a "joy" I had never felt before.
Being needed by someone. Having a certain amount of emotion poured into me by a specific someone.
I don't know a greater joy than this.
And now, I was about to obtain that joy.
I put my relaxed arms around Shiona's back.
Shiona accepted it.
Warmth increased deep inside my chest.
"Shiona, I..."
"Yes, Ray. I know. So let's go home, to the house..."
Shiona's hand, connected to mine.
I turned on my heel and moved my feet towards the library exit.
"...Thank you, Ray. But, this is for the best. Because this is for Ray's sake."
I felt a sense of unease at Shiona's words.
Shiona called out to me, who had suddenly stopped walking, with a puzzled voice.
"Shiona, you just said, 'For my sake,' didn't you?"
"Yes, I certainly said that."
"That's wrong, Shiona."
"Wrong? What's wrong, Ray?"
"If you're saying it's for my sake, then this is wrong."
"It's not wrong. Doing this is for Ray's sake."
"It is wrong. Because I'm happy when I can be useful to someone. I'm here to be useful to someone. But now, I'm about to disappear from the person I can be useful to. That's not my joy, and it's not for my sake. So, who is this for?"
"Shiona, I'm going to Tipy. That's not for anyone else, it's for myself. If someone becomes unhappy because of this, then it's my fault. But even if that happens, I won't stop. Because that's the result I wished for."
Letting go of Shiona's hand, I pushed forward into the entrance once more.
Shiona's voice didn't reach my back.
Shiona just stared at me silently, with a sad expression, saying nothing.
Passing through the entrance that smelled of rain, I moved deeper into the library.
I could feel the moisture from the soles of my shoes being absorbed by the carpet with every step.
The dry air of the library clung to my wet skin.
An unpleasant feeling lingered.
Perhaps it was related to Shiona, whom I had just parted with.
My chest ached deep inside, as if I had swallowed something heavy.
Shiona's face crossed my mind many times.
Every one of them wore a sad smile.
Why did things turn out this way?
Why did I do such a thing?
Waves of regret washed over me.
But I couldn't rest my feet.
—That child is deeper inside.
The girl who was always alone.
The girl who was always blue.
The girl who was always shedding tears.
I couldn't leave that girl alone.
That's why I was walking down this corridor.
Pictures were pasted on the corridor walls.
Those pictures, which Tipy supposedly drew one a day.
In the pictures drawn on brand new paper, a single girl was depicted.
I immediately knew who that girl was.
A small girl drawn alone in a large piece of paper.
Tears were streaming down her cheeks.
The pictures from recently all had the same composition.
Pictures of a lonely girl crying.
Looking at those pictures made my chest ache terribly.
The girl had been alone all this time.
I felt like I understood that sadness.
I wanted to wipe away that sadness quickly.
I wanted to tell her she wasn't alone.
I wanted to tell her I would be by her side.
Dragging my wet soles, I advanced down the long corridor.
Gazing at the pictures pasted at a height Tipy could reach, I moved forward.
At that moment, I suddenly felt a sense of unease.
It wasn't because of the content of the pictures.
The problem was the number of pictures.
Tipy was clearly a young girl, not even in her teens.
If she drew a picture every day, could she really draw this many?
...Perhaps there were days when she drew several pictures.
Even so, this number of pictures was impossible.
Was the girl that lonely?
Did she have nothing else to do but draw pictures?
Ah, why did I leave the girl alone?
How many tears did I make her shed because of that?
The amount of tears in the girl in the pictures increased with each passing day.
It seemed to represent how the girl's sadness was deepening.
I hurried.
To the girl who was likely crying alone deeper inside.
To heal that sadness.
And to wipe away those tears.
To hold the girl. Her body, in these two hands.
I walked quickly, almost out of breath, towards the innermost part of the library.
The girl wasn't there, where she should always be.
The teddy bear she kept with her at all times wasn't there either.
All that remained were an unfinished drawing and crayons.
The unfinished drawing depicted a girl crying all alone.
—Where could Tipy have gone?
I searched the surrounding bookshelves, but I couldn't find her.
Could she be somewhere else in this library?
Or perhaps, outside this library?
I didn't know the truth.
I wouldn't know unless I searched for Tipy.
I started walking.
Weaving through the bookshelves, I searched for the blue girl.
A library with such a vast area isn't suitable for searching for someone.
Plus, there was this darkness.
Just looking from the edge of the bookshelf wasn't enough to find her.
I would have to check step by step, with my own feet.
I walked through the aisles between the bookshelves, from the back of the library towards the entrance.
Before I knew it, my clothes, which should have been wet, had started to dry.
And around the time my hair was completely dry.
Finally, I was able to find the girl.
The girl was standing on a large stepladder, arranging books on a shelf.
The girl was a resident of this library and also served as a librarian.
She was probably returning the books that the townspeople had returned to their original places like this.
That was a demanding task for this small girl.
The thousands of bookshelves in this library were stacked up to the ceiling and connected to each other.
I didn't even want to think about the total number of books, it was terrifying.
The girl faced such a large quantity of books and managed them like this every day.
All alone, inside this library.
Thinking that, I couldn't help but feel a tightening in the depths of my chest for some reason.
Tipy stretched on the stepladder and returned books larger than her face to the shelf.
After finishing that task and taking a breath, Tipy turned her face towards me.
"...Ray! ...Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa..."
Noticing my presence, Tipy lost her balance on the stepladder.
"Look out, Tipy!!"
The stepladder fell.
Tipy's hand reached out.
As if to respond to that hand, I extended both of my hands.
—An impact, piercing from my chest to my back.
When I realized it, I was holding Tipy in my arms and had fallen onto the floor on my back.
"Ray... you came, Ray...!!"
Tipy rubbed her cheek against my chest repeatedly.
Out of relief, I stroked Tipy's head.
Her soft hair welcomed my hand.
"Tipy, are you hurt anywhere? Are you injured?"
"Yeah, I'm okay. Are you hurt anywhere, Ray?"
"I'm okay. Thank you for worrying about me."
"You saved Tipy... I love you, Ray..."
The small girl's hands gripped my clothes.
I felt a slightly wet and warm sensation on my chest.
Tipy was shedding tears.
But, they looked like tears different from usual.
Surely they were tears of relief.
By being here, I must be able to lighten Tipy's heart a little.
Thinking that, joy rushed through me.
"Tipy, was arranging books. I'm good, right? Good?"
"Ah, you're good. You're a very good girl."
"Hey, pet me. Because I'm a good girl, pet Tipy's head."
"Okay... Tipy is a good girl, a good girl..."
I stroked her silky hair.
"Yay...! Ray is petting my head. Tipy is happy..."
"Are you always arranging books?"
"Yeah. I'm repairing books. Because I want lots of different people to read them a lot."
I looked up at the bookshelf.
Certainly, some of the books were quite old-fashioned.
Some had worn spines, and some were discolored.
Tipy was repairing these...
I remembered wetting the books with rain.
If I handle them roughly, I'll just increase Tipy's work like this.
I sincerely swore to handle them with care.
I sat up and leaned my back against a nearby bookshelf.
"Sorry I'm late."
"It's okay... because Ray came like this."
"Were you okay by yourself?"
"No... I was very, very lonely."
"Were you crying?"
"Yeah... yeah, yeah..."
Tipy pressed her face against my chest.
Occasionally, I heard her sniffling.
"It's okay, we'll be together from now on."
"Always? Ray, will you be with Tipy?"
"Yeah, that's right. I'll try to come to the library as much as possible."
"Won't you live together?"
Tipy lifted her face.
Large tears welled up in her eyes.
"That's a little difficult. I'm being taken care of by Shiona right now."
"But, I'll come every day. Then you won't be lonely, right?"
"Yeah... but, the nights are really lonely."
"Nights, huh..."
"It's dark, and quiet... Tipy sometimes thinks she might be all alone in the world."
"That's not true. That's not true..."
All I could do was hold Tipy.
A sweet scent came from Tipy.
A sweet scent, different from Shiona's.
"Yeah, I know... just you coming like this makes Tipy happy. Hey, Ray. Can I ask for a favor?"
"Yeah, what is it? Tipy."
"Will you help me?"
"Yeah... of course, it's an easy request."
Standing up, I held Tipy's hand.
Pushing a cart with several books in it, we walked through the library.
"Next is... um, the book called 'Philosophy of Mind and Body'."
"Then it's easy, 493, third shelf from the top, 13th book from the right."
When I said the book title, Tipy immediately said its location without hesitation.
It was as if she knew the location of every single book in this library.
In the location she mentioned, there was indeed a gap for one book.
When I put it in, it fit perfectly.
Tipy wasn't just guessing.
She was indicating the book's location with certainty.
I became interested and decided to ask a slightly mischievous question.
"Hey Tipy, can I ask you something?"
"Do you remember the beginning of this novel?"
The book I held out was a very old-fashioned novel.
Tipy stared at the title and began to recite it as if she were opening the book in her mind.
"'Looking down, there was a height of five floors. Right next to the school building, cream-colored bricks were laid, creating a sidewalk that would feel nice to walk on. Right next to the sidewalk was a flower bed, and even from this height, I could see the colorful flowers. If I were to throw myself from here, would the cream color, and the flowers, all be stained with my dirty blood?'"
Tipy read it out, word for word, without a single mistake.
It matched the handwritten text in the novel perfectly.
"Could it be that you remember all the books here?"
"Hmm... I don't know."
"Then, what about this book?"
With a glance at the book I held out, Tipy recited it fluently.
"'There are approximately 206 bones that make up the human body, starting from the head: occipital bone, frontal bone, temporal bone, parietal bone, sphenoid bone, ethmoid bone, malleus, incus, stapes, inferior nasal concha, lacrimal bone, nasal bone, vomer, maxilla, palatine bone, zygomatic bone, mandible, hyoid bone, and from there connecting to the cervical vertebrae, extending to the thoracic vertebrae, lumbar vertebrae, sacrum, coccyx, ribs, and sternum.'"
"...Then what about this?"
I held out a handwritten book titled 'Encyclopedia of Pi'.
"What's the beginning of this 'Soulless Child Theory'?"
"'All things are finite, and even the soul is no exception. A child born after the soul is depleted will be a soulless vessel. Edward Morgue.'"
Tipy has memorized all the books here.
But, why?
Even if she had an amazing memory, she would first need to read these books.
Even if she read them continuously every day, she would never be able to finish reading this sea of books.
What in the world does this mean...?
"Ray, what's wrong?"
"No, it's nothing. Come on, let's put the next book away."
There's no point in thinking about something I can't find the answer to.
For now, I'll focus on helping Tipy with her work.
After putting all the books back on the shelves, we sat down in our usual spot.
"Ray, thank you for helping me."
Tipy clung to me more than usual.
Was it a reaction to not being able to see me until now?
Her figure leaning against me was cute and endearing.
"It's okay, Tipy. You usually do it alone, right?"
"Yeah... I've always, always been alone. I'm lonely."
"...Since when have you been alone?"
Perhaps that was a forbidden question.
Tipy looked up at me sadly.
"Tipy has been alone for a long, long time."
And then, Tipy told me.
The sad story of how Tipy came to be alone.
"Papa, Mama."
That was a story from when Tipy's parents were still at the library.
The little girl loved them very much.
She loved her kind mother and father very much.
Her mother always smiled and gently hugged Tipy.
Her father always gently watched the two of them while organizing books.
"Tipy is as clingy as ever."
Her father took out an electronic device for books from his desk.
"Oh, that's right. Tipy preferred this one."
He put away the electronic device with a wry smile and took out a "book" made of paper instead.
The technology of printing had already become obsolete, and now it was a valuable cultural artifact.
"Tipy-chan, come here."
Called onto her mother's lap, she happily sat down.
And on Tipy's lap was a teddy bear that her parents had chosen for her.
Every day was fun for Tipy.
The days spent with her beloved mother and father were fun.
And there wasn't a day she didn't feel happy.
Her mother always praised the pictures Tipy drew.
"She'll surely be an artist someday. I'm so proud, Father."
Her father always had hope for Tipy's future.
She wished those days would continue forever.
She wanted to stay together, just the three of them, like this forever.
Tipy always thought that.
Before she knew it, the days when her parents' brows furrowed increased.
Tipy didn't like that expression.
The town also seemed restless.
All the adults were talking about something in unison.
But young Tipy didn't understand what it meant.
Only the anxiety that her life as it was would be broken was welling up inside her.
One day, the phone rang.
The sound seemed very sad to Tipy.
Her father, who answered the phone, started to furrow his brows.
That was the expression Tipy didn't like.
After hanging up the phone, her father was talking to her mother about something.
After a while, the talk turned into an argument.
They were arguing about something.
The only thing she understood was that watching the two of them argue was very sad.
"Tipy-chan, can you listen?"
Some time after that, her mother looked at Tipy with a serious expression.
Behind her was her father—and packed luggage.
Tipy instinctively realized that their life as it was wouldn't continue.
"Something terrible is happening in the world right now."
"Many people are scared and having sleepless nights. Tipy-chan doesn't want that, right?"
"There are children all over the world who feel that way. Mother wants to help them if possible."
"Yes... I thought Tipy-chan would surely say that... And so, Tipy-chan, this is the important part. Can you listen even if you don't understand?"
"Actually, Father and Mother have to go far away to help those children. Even if we go, maybe we can't change the situation... But, there's a possibility."
"No. Much, much farther away. A place so far that it will take days or even weeks to get there."
Her father stopped Tipy, who was about to head to her room.
"Tipy doesn't need to pack for a trip."
"That's not it... Actually, Tipy, Father and Mother are going to that place by ourselves."
"By yourselves...? What about Tipy...?"
Her parents looked at each other.
Tipy felt something from her parents' sad faces.
Suddenly, tears overflowed.
"I'm sorry, Tipy-chan, we can't do that."
"Where Mother and Father are going is a very dangerous place. We don't want to take Tipy-chan to such a dangerous place. Because Mother and Father cherish Tipy-chan."
"No... No, no, no... Tipy is going too..."
Her parents gently hugged Tipy.
"I'm sorry, Tipy-chan... Even so, Mother and Father have to go."
"I'm sorry, Tipy... It's okay, we'll definitely be back soon."
"We'll be back soon... We'll be back right away so you won't be lonely..."
"Tipy, be a good girl and stay home. And, show us Tipy's pictures again."
"Ah, yes. Draw one picture every day. What Tipy saw, what you heard, what you learned, what you felt. When we come back, won't you tell us about it?"
"That's right. I'll also make many stories into books during our trip. I'll come back to tell them to Tipy."
"Ah, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. I promise, so..."
The three family members hugged each other.
To heal that parting, which they didn't know how long it would last—.
How much time had passed since then?
Tipy continued to draw, just as her father had told her.
With each picture she drew, she would stick it on the wall. So that it would be immediately noticeable when her parents came back.
What she saw...
What she heard...
What she learned...
What she felt...
But eventually, it became filled with her feelings for her parents.
I want to be hugged, I want my head stroked, I want you to call my name, quickly... I want to see you...
Her heart was dyed blue, blue.
The girl continued to draw, shedding tears...
Tipy told me about her sad past, shedding blue drops of sorrow.
Her small shoulders were trembling fragilely.
The girl enduring sadness in front of me.
I cannot fathom how great that sadness is.
Perhaps because I have never felt such sadness before.
So I cannot understand Tipy's feelings.
But I should be able to heal that sadness.
By hugging that small body.
Surely.
Tipy was sitting with her back against the wall.
I reached out my hand to her slender body.
When I touched her shoulder, Tipy's body gave a small jump.
It wasn't rejection.
It seemed she was just a little surprised by the sudden action in the darkness.
"It's okay, Tipy. It's okay."
"Hey, Ray, won't you disappear from in front of Tipy?"
"Yeah, I won't disappear."
"Won't you leave Tipy alone?"
"Yeah, I won't leave you alone."
"Won't you make Tipy lonely?"
"Yeah, I won't make you lonely."
"Won't you make Tipy sad?"
"Yeah, I won't make you sad."
"Will you cherish Tipy?"
"Yeah, I'll cherish you."
"Will you hug Tipy?"
Yeah, I'll hug you.
Will you hold Tipy?
Yeah, I'll hold you.
Will you stroke Tipy's head?
Yeah, I'll stroke it.
Will you hold hands with Tipy?
Yeah, I'll hold hands.
Will you stay with Tipy forever?
Tipy's eyes glowed faintly in the darkness.
The shoulder I touched held a body temperature that was almost too hot.
I pulled Tipy's body close—
Oh, you two are getting along well.
The voice that echoed in the darkness wasn't the girl's, who I was just trying to comfort.
It was Shiona's, who was supposed to have parted ways with us at the entrance.
Before I knew it, Shiona was standing beside us.
With a smile that could be seen even in the dim light, Shiona approached us directly.
But you know, getting along too well is a problem. You're a boy and a girl of that age, after all.
Shiona stopped the hand I had reached out to Tipy.
N-No...
Tipy's face, which had been seeking that arm, twisted in sadness.
I couldn't help but raise my voice at Shiona.
Shiona, what are you doing!
What's wrong? You're so worked up. You have to think about physical contact with kids that age.
That's not it. Tipy is sad... I'm trying to heal her sadness, even just a little.
Sad? About what?
About her parents who haven't come back yet! Tipy has been all alone this whole time. She's been lonely this whole time!
That's reality, so it can't be helped.
Can't be helped? What do you mean by that...
Shiona walked closer to Tipy.
And then, she looked at Tipy, who was small and grieving.
Tipy-chan? It's unfortunate, but Tipy-chan is all alone, you know? She has been, and she will be, forever.
She said that with her usual tone, still smiling.
Shiona, what are you saying...
Tipy-chan, you know it too, don't you? Your father and mother aren't coming back anymore, are they?
Shiona... stop... Don't say such cruel things...
You know the truth, don't you? You just don't want to admit it.
...No... No... I don't want to...
Tipy-chan's father and mother...
...Shiona... stop...
Are already dead—
STOP ITTTTTT!!
My voice echoed through the library.
My whole body was burning up.
My breathing was ragged, and I felt a pain deep in my head.
My clenched teeth were grinding and groaning.
My vision was flickering, and I could barely stand.
And at the same time, I was certain.
Something in my chest was red and prickly. The feeling Mad-san always had.
This feeling is 'anger'.
I felt anger at the unreasonableness happening before my eyes.
Now, the blue girl's hope was severed.
With Shiona's heartless words, Tipy was hurt.
Tipy was crying with a silent voice.
Her face was a mess.
Her sadness turned into large drops, flowing down her cheeks.
With her small body, she was desperately telling a story of bottomless sadness.
Shiona added insult to injury.
Because that's right, isn't it? How long do you think it's been since Tipy-chan's father and mother came back?
Tipy-chan, you draw pictures every day, don't you? How many have you drawn now?
Stop it...
Doesn't it make you sad drawing every day? How many more pictures do you have to draw for your father and mother to come back?
Stop... it...
It's useless no matter how much you cry. Tears only flow to comfort yourself. Nothing changes just because you cry.
...Stop it...
That's just self-satisfaction. You're just crying because someone will be kind to you if you shed tears, aren't you? That's just running away from reality.
...Stop... it...
It's time to realize. Your father and mother aren't coming back. Never again. Tipy-chan, you'll never be able to see your father and mother again.
Also, let me tell you. Ray is only here because he pities Tipy-chan. It's not the love that your father and mother poured into Tipy-chan. Only pity is tying Ray here. Tipy-chan, do you understand? You're all alone forever.
STOP ITTTTTT—
A roar of anger echoed.
When the voice echoing off the walls stopped, only Tipy's sobbing remained.
Tipy looked up at Shiona with hollow eyes.
I felt like the light that had been in them just a moment ago had disappeared.
Ray, pampering is different from comforting.
That's not true... That's not, true...
Ray, you need to accept reality too. Tipy-chan's parents are no longer in this world.
No... That's not true...
Then why haven't they contacted you even once? Not even a single letter to Tipy-chan, whom they loved and cherished so much?
That's... surely, they're busy and don't have time to contact...
If they knew you were worried, they wouldn't spare that time. Especially for their beloved child. The fact that they haven't means—
Stop it... Stop, it...
—Tipy-chan's father and mother, they're already dead.
I froze.
Shiona's tone was as gentle as usual, and her smile was the same as always.
It would have been better if she had said it in a cold, emotionless voice.
In that atmosphere, which was almost abnormal, I couldn't say anything more.
Shiona's face, as she turned back to Tipy, was smiling.
Tipy-chan, your only family is your father and mother. But those two aren't coming back. So no matter how much you're with someone, you'll never be truly fulfilled. Even if Ray is with you, you can't become a family. That's a fact that can't be changed. You'll always be all alone.
Shiona turned on her heel and headed towards the entrance.
On the way, she looked back at me just once.
But her gaze was still directed at the floor.
Ray... This is all for you.
Shiona said only that and left the library.
The hall fell silent.
Now, not even Tipy's sobbing could be heard.
I was furious at Shiona's words and actions, and then I felt drained.
I couldn't even stand up.
But I couldn't leave the girl alone like this.
The girl must be thinking.
She is all alone in the world.
that she had to live her life in solitude.
I didn't want her to think that.
I wanted her to know she wasn't alone.
My feelings for Tipy aren't pity.
They are absolutely not pity.
I repeated it over and over.
As if to tell myself, again and again.
I reached out my hand to Tipy's shoulder.
I pulled her slender shoulders close.
Tipy flinched at first, startled, but then settled into my chest.
She pressed her face against me, crying silently.
I stroked her trembling shoulders over and over.
If only I could ease the sadness she held in her small body, even just a little...
I don't know how long we stayed like that.
We sat there, leaning against each other.
After a while, when the sense of time had disappeared.
Tipy stumbled to her feet and walked as if searching for something.
Tipy didn't answer.
It was her sketchbook and crayons.
Tipy returned to me with the two items.
She sat down, leaning her back against my stomach.
Tipy didn't answer again.
Instead, she flipped through the drawing paper.
With a brand new page as her canvas, Tipy held a crayon in her hand.
And without hesitation, she ran the crayon across the paper.
What was being drawn was a cute picture, appropriate for her age.
The first thing she drew was a picture of a blue girl.
There were tear stains on her cheeks.
Her eyes were tinged with red.
I gently stroked Tipy's head.
Lowering her gaze again, Tipy ran the crayon across the drawing paper.
The next thing being drawn seemed to be me.
My hand was placed on the girl's head.
It looked like a scene where I was gently stroking her head.
And then—
It was Shiona.
She was standing a little distance away, looking at the girl with a scary face.
That was Shiona to Tipy.
Even from my perspective, Shiona in front of Tipy would appear like that in a picture.
Why did Shiona do something like that?
Shiona said.
That it was all for me.
I don't know what that means.
No, I didn't want to know.
I don't understand what it means for it to be for me after making Tipy cry.
Can I become happy by making someone else unhappy?
No, that can't be true.
It shouldn't be.
As if to erase Shiona's words that clung to my ears, I hugged Tipy.
Her voice was faint and seemed about to disappear.
But deep down, I felt a little bit of joy.
As I looked at the picture, I thought.
Perhaps this was Tipy's way of avoiding sadness.
They say people dream at the end of the day.
It is said that this is to organize the memories of the events that happened that day.
Perhaps for Tipy, this picture is that.
The events that happened that day—
Including the good things and the bad things, she draws everything in pictures.
By doing so, perhaps she is organizing her memories and calming her heart.
In fact, Tipy's expression had softened somewhat.
As the drawing progressed, her sadness eased.
As if passing her sadness onto the picture.
Tipy stood up and pulled my hand.
As I followed where her hand led, we arrived at a wall covered in pictures.
Pictures she drew one a day.
The number of pictures was immense.
Tipy pasted the picture she drew today at the very end.
Another picture was added to Tipy's collection.
The wall full of pictures felt like a diary showing this girl's solitude.
Tipy must have spent all her time alone on this story.
Such a sad story, all by herself...
Thinking that, something welled up from deep within my chest.
Seeing her eyes filled with sorrow, I couldn't help but choke up.
Instead of answering, I pulled Tipy close.
After a while, I could hear her quiet breathing as she slept.
I compared Tipy sleeping in my arms to the picture diary on the wall.
Perhaps this picture book is Tipy's heart itself.
Thinking such things, I fell asleep.
It was the church where I live.
I stood in front of the familiar white, large door.
I pushed the door open with both hands.
The chapel inside was enveloped in surprising silence.
—No, it wasn't complete silence.
Because I heard the sound of quiet sobbing reaching my ears.
I pushed forward through the chapel.
Then, I came face to face with the person who was sobbing.
It was the person who always had a smile on her face.
It was Shiona.
Shiona was crying, her slender shoulders trembling.
I couldn't hide my surprise at that.
—Why is she crying?
I didn't know the reason.
But, it was a fact that Shiona was crying in front of me.
Those tears were not false.
Even so, I couldn't do anything.
...No, that's not true.
There must be something I can do.
I reached out my hand.
My fingertips reached out towards Shiona's eyes.
I don't seem to be able to stop those tears.
But, I can wipe away those tears that have fallen.
Even though that's all I can do—
I reached my fingertips towards the large drops.
Midway, my hand stopped.
My fingertips are made of machine.
The extended index finger had the unique luster of metal...
That's right.
I had forgotten.
No, I wanted to forget.
I am not a human.
I am a created being.
Why is that?
Am I not even allowed to wipe away the tears of someone important to me?
Shiona is crying.
She continues to shed tears.
Is this a sadness that Shiona has never shown before?
But, I cannot stop or wipe away those endlessly flowing tears.
If that's the case, why am I here?
Being here, what can I do for Shiona?
I couldn't find the answer.
I couldn't move my extended mechanical hand any further...
—Immediately after, a cacophony of metal scraping against metal echoed around.
That ear-splitting sound echoed intermittently.
Then, my extended fingertips—
Their parts crumbled and fell to the floor.
The collapse that started from my fingertips—my palm—my wrist—my arm—my shoulder—increased its range.
Parts of my entire body crumbled and fell.
Eventually, it became difficult for me to even stand there, and I fell to the floor.
My legs, my torso, were turning into scrap.
Scrap metal piled up around me.
I couldn't make a sound, and I had no choice but to accept the collapse.
Shiona was crying the whole time.
Crying silently.
I can no longer even extend a mechanical hand.
Because there is no longer even an arm or fingertips there.
The collapse corroded my entire body, reaching my head.
I don't feel pain.
I shouldn't feel pain.
But...
I felt pain deep in my chest, where it should no longer exist.
The last sight I saw as my vision crumbled was Shiona's sad expression and tears.
Eventually, I became just a pile of metal—
A pile of scrap.
—There, I woke up.
I was shouting something, but I don't remember.
My breathing is ragged.
I quickly checked my surroundings.
A dim, dusty space.
Warm air that clung heavily.
And, thick books lined up on the shelves.
This was the library.
It seemed I had fallen asleep yesterday and woken up like this in the morning.
I hurriedly took off my glove and checked my right hand.
It was still there, unchanged, even though it should have crumbled just now.
But, just like in the dream, it was made of machine.
On my lap, Tipiy had somehow fallen asleep, her breathing soft.
Her innocent sleeping face showed no sign of yesterday's sadness.
It seems I was experiencing what humans call a dream.
During sleep mode, I sometimes glimpse past records to organize my memory area.
But what I just experienced was probably like a prediction based on experience and memory.
Could it be that this kind of possibility is hidden in the future... and that was calculated?
Even so, how sad.
I still couldn't calm the unease deep in my chest.
Why do Shiona's tears disturb me so much?
And why am I so powerless?
I am not real.
I knew that.
I thought I knew that.
But, even so, I want to make them smile.
I want to make Shiona, Tipiy, and everyone in town smile.
But, I can't do that.
I can see the answer, but I don't want to admit it.
—It's because I am a creation.
The one truth I can't resist.
But, even so, I wished.
I wanted to make everyone around me smile.
Yet, that wish won't come true.
When I try to make Tipiy smile, Shiona doesn't smile.
When I try to make Shiona smile, I can't wipe away Tipiy's tears.
How difficult.
Isn't there a way to make everyone smile more skillfully?
Watching Tipiy's sad sleeping face, I repeated it over and over in my chest.
I stroked Tipiy's head with my fingertips.
Her smooth hair allowed my fingertips to pass through to the ends without tangling.
A sweet scent spread.
"Mm... mmm..."
Was she dreaming? Tipiy let out a small sound.
Looking at her young sleeping face, my desire to protect her grew stronger.
But, how?
Looking alternately at my mechanical right hand and Tipiy's face, I was at a loss.
I thought I wished this gentle time would continue forever.
—But, it didn't.
A strange sound echoed from afar.
Footsteps echoed, like many people walking at the exact same time.
And, faintly echoing screams and the sound of something being broken.
Those two things shattered even my small wish.
I hurriedly put the glove back on my right hand.
"Wh-What... Ray, what is it...?"
Tipiy woke up at the abnormality.
An anxious expression, which hadn't been there just moments ago, spread across Tipiy's face.
"I don't know... but it seems something has happened."
"Something? Something what?"
"I have no idea. But I think it's certainly a bad situation."
I stood up and turned my toes towards the library aisle.
"...Ray? Where are you going?"
"I'm going to go check things out for a bit."
"No... don't go, Ray."
"It's okay, I'm not going anywhere. I'm just going to check things out from the rooftop for a little while."
"No... no..."
Tipiy hugged me and cried.
She must be seeing the image of her parents who are gone.
"It's okay. It's okay, Tipiy."
"No... no..."
"Have I ever broken a promise to you, Tipiy?"
"That's right, that's right. When I said I'd come see you, I always did, didn't I?"
"So it's okay. I'll look from the rooftop and come right back."
"...Okay. But come back quickly, okay?"
"Yes, of course."
After making a promise with Tipiy, I headed for the library rooftop.
After climbing the long spiral staircase, I arrived in front of an old, rusty door.
There was no sign of it having been used for a long time.
When I opened it, a grating sound echoed unpleasantly in my ears.
Ignoring it, I pushed the door open.
...And at the same time.
An anomaly jumped into my eyes.
Black smoke was rising from all over town.
The scream-like sounds weren't a mistake; they were coming from the mouths of townspeople fleeing from something.
And chasing those townspeople were multiple figures wearing dirty cloaks.
They walked silently with firearms at the ready—yet, with seamless coordination, they steadily cornered the fleeing people.
It was a movement as if everything had been calculated.
The townspeople cornered against a wall and the attackers exchanged some words.
The attackers exchanged glances and nodded, then pointed their gun barrels at the townspeople's heads.
And, without the slightest hesitation, they pulled the fingers on the triggers.
—With a dry sound, the head shook violently as if bursting, and the townsperson collapsed on the spot...
At that sound, I came back to myself and understood the situation.
It's hard to believe... but it seems this town is being attacked.
What Shiona said was true...
I hurried back to the lobby.
Seeing me like that, Tipiy asked anxiously.
"Ray... did something happen? You look really scared."
"...I don't really know... but... well... something bad is happening..."
Unable to tell Tipiy exactly what I saw, I spoke vaguely.
"Something bad? What do you mean?"
"I think... this town is being attacked..."
"No... Tipiy, I'm scared..."
"It's okay, it's far away in town. It should still be safe here, so calm down."
"...Okay... but what are you going to do?"
"I'm going to... go and see what's happening."
I was worried about the town, but even more so about Shiona.
Even after what happened yesterday, she was still the human who helped me.
I haven't heard the reason why Shiona, who is kind to everyone, is so harsh only to Tipiy.
I still don't understand the meaning of her words when she said it was for my sake.
No, don't go... please... Ray...
It's okay, Tipiy. I'll definitely come back.
Really? Really, really?
Yes, of course. So, can you wait for me for just a little while?
If you come back, Tipiy will wait.
Tipiy hugged her teddy bear tightly.
Even so, the anxiety couldn't be wiped away from her expression.
Is there nothing I can do for this girl's sadness and anxiety?
With such a dark feeling left in my chest, I left the library.
I decided to use the back alleys as much as possible on the way to town.
What was happening in town was clearly not good.
There was a risk of me being harmed if I was found.
I made sure to keep my footsteps as quiet as possible as I headed towards the square.
I wanted to arrive before the formation if possible, but since I had taken many detours, that seemed impossible.
The closer I got to the center of town, the more broken buildings I saw.
But these were all buildings that didn't seem like they would break until yesterday.
Did those strangers who were chasing the townspeople break them?
Dust was drifting in the town that was clean until yesterday.
Why is it necessary to destroy the buildings of this peaceful town?
I just couldn't accept that.
As the screams and the noise of buildings being destroyed grew louder, I reached the truth.
—To the horrific scene happening in the square.
Many men were chasing and capturing the townspeople.
Pointing guns at them, they were driving men, women, and even children, regardless of age, using unreasonable violence as a shield.
The captured townspeople were made to sit in the center of the square.
Crying children. Inarticulate roars of anger.
Ignoring such sounds as if they were nothing, the armed men had calm expressions.
No, perhaps the expression 'calm' is wrong.
It was a face that showed no interest, like glancing at a stone lying on the side of the road.
I couldn't see Shiona within my range of vision. Can I assume she hasn't been captured yet...?
—Status report.
—The majority of residents have been captured. The rest are just a matter of time.
Nearby, I overheard two men talking.
So as not to be noticed, I slowly approached the two of them and listened in.
How are the water and food supplies?
They were sufficiently stocked. As for water, an underground water source was found.
I see, so it turned out to be a better harvest than expected.
Yes, it's possible to settle here like this.
I was convinced.
That these men were the humans who attacked the town to steal water and food.
I just couldn't forgive their unreasonableness.
That they would hurt innocent people just for the sake of plunder.
But, I couldn't do anything more than that.
I couldn't even rush out from that spot.
I knew better than anyone that I was a powerless being.
But how did you find such a small town?
—There was a male slave who escaped the other day, wasn't there?
—He was advocating for coexistence with the Philoids, if I recall...
Ah. A foolish man, trapped by the ideology of the old era. Coexistence and harmony with the Philoids, a thought too useless in this world.
—Coexistence and harmony...
Those words brought a young man to mind.
He was the one I saved and brought to this town... and his last words before he passed away.
Does that mean these humans were the ones who inflicted those injuries on him?
That's why we treated him the same as a Philoid and kept him alive as labor.
That's right. We were chasing him to bring him back, and he ended up being useful in an unexpected way.
One of the men continued in a monotone voice.
A human appeared to help that man and guided us to the town.
Hearing those words, I felt my back turn cold.
At that time, why didn't I consider the cause of that young man's injuries?
I should have heard from Shiona that there was a group carrying out plunder...
Even when I returned to town, if I had been more careful of my surroundings, I might have avoided being followed.
I regret taking such an easy action on a momentary impulse.
The cause of this attack was—...me.
We have finished gathering the main residents of the town in one place. There are no resistors.
I see. Then select those among them who are of the oral intake type and lack production and management capabilities. Factors that reduce productivity are—
Saying that, the man who had been receiving the report pulled a handgun from his pocket.
Disposal.
—Stop it!
At the same time I understood the meaning of those words, I had already screamed.
However, I couldn't help but scream at the humans who so lightly said 'disposal' about the townspeople who had taken care of me.
Then, the men who were there turned around.
And our eyes met.
Secure him.
With that voice, the men rushed towards me.
I started running in a panic.
But my body wasn't keeping up with my feelings.
My legs wouldn't move properly, and I ended up running away while losing my balance.
The men immediately closed in behind me.
Their movements were precise, like machines.
This is bad, I'll be caught at this rate.
In a desperate gamble, I ran into an alley.
There were several muddy puddles in the alley due to the rain.
I ran through, stumbling with my feet.
Occasionally, I would knock over lumber leaning against the wall to try and slow down the men's movements.
But that wasn't enough to even stop them.
I knew the men were right behind me.
Can I escape like this...?
Where I was aiming for was the library.
Even if I managed to escape to the library like this, Tipiy's presence would be revealed to them.
If Tipiy were attacked—.
I changed the direction of my toes.
I ran into what looked like the back door of the nearest building.
By chance, it was Mad's general store.
I looked for a place to hide—.
!?
I found a figure sitting in a chair.
Mad didn't answer. He was sitting shallowly in the chair with his arms crossed, just like after he had run the projector that day.
Mad, you can hear me, right!? Stop joking at a time like this, Mad—Mad?
I swallowed the scream just in time.
The moment I touched Mad's shoulder, Mad—collapsed quietly from the chair. As if he had already passed away.
Wh-Why—!
Could it be that those men had 'disposed' of him? But if so, there were no external injuries.
Target found.
Ironically, it was the voices of the men who had been chasing me that brought me back to my senses from the brink of panic.
But it was far too late.
The current labor force is sufficient, eliminate him.
I couldn't do anything, just jumped back from Mad in a panic, the men stepping in, and the lead man aimed his handgun at me—
Ray!
Immediately after, several things happened at once.
The gunshot that echoed with a dry sound.
And the figure that slid in front of me as if to shield me—.
Sh—
It took me time to grasp the situation.
That person was standing there, shielding me.
That person turned only their face to look at me.
With their usual unchanging smile, that person looked at me.
And a few seconds later—.
Shionaaaaa!
With a blank mind, I screamed.
My body, seeing that figure, had started moving unconsciously.
With the mechanical arm hidden under my glove, I punched down one of the shelves. It caused a chain reaction, knocking down shelves throughout the store—scattering fine fragments and even finer dust everywhere.
At the same time, I picked up a can of food that had fallen on the floor and threw it with all my might towards the window.
The men reacted to the sound of the window glass breaking.
Did he escape through the window?
Chase him.
The men leaped out through the open door.
Did they leave—
As for me, I was crouched down right next to the fallen shelf, half my body sunk into the floor that had been dislodged by the impact.
Holding the fallen Shiona in my arms so that the shelves and fragments wouldn't hit her.
Shiona, Shiona, hang in there!
I desperately shook Shiona, who had her eyes closed.
It seems she's just fainted.
I let my gaze crawl over Shiona's body, but I couldn't find any signs of injury.
Did the bullet miss? But since she's unconscious, I can't say she's safe.
Anyway, I need to evacuate immediately.
—A place nearby where I can do that is...
Taking a deep breath, I remembered.
The girl I had left waiting at the library.
I took the back roads so the humans wouldn't find me and returned to the library.
Carrying Shiona on my back was a considerable handicap, but I pushed forward, weaving through the destroyed buildings again and again.
During that time, Shiona didn't move at all. That was helpful for carrying her, but at the same time, my anxiety grew.
What if something happened to Shiona—While being crushed by that fear, I arrived at the library.
The clouds covering the sky had grown even darker in color.
Having finally reached the library, I looked for Tipiy.
Is Tipiy safe?
So far, there's no sign of the library having been ransacked.
There's no trace of anyone having entered.
After passing through the entrance, silence permeated the building.
Feeling relieved, I wove between the shelves, searching for Tipiy.
But no matter how much I searched, I couldn't find Tipiy.
Could it be—
I desperately searched the area, trying to shake off the unpleasant thought.
Could it be—
I headed towards the lobby, relying on hope.
I went around behind it.
There, I found Tipiy, covering her ears and eyes, trembling slightly.
I reached out my hand to her small body.
"Tipiy, I'm back."
Tipiy's shoulders jumped slightly.
But when she recognized me, she hugged me with the force of jumping.
"Welcome back. I believed in you, Ray."
Large tears pressed against my chest.
Her body was trembling uncontrollably.
Ah, I had made this child anxious again.
I put my arm around her back and stroked it.
"It's okay... I won't leave you alone again."
Perhaps relieved by those words, Tipiy's trembling lessened, and eventually stopped.
"What happened? Shiona, what's wrong?"
Looking at Shiona, who still had her eyes closed, Tipiy asked anxiously.
I told her everything, without hiding anything.
"She was shot. To protect me... It doesn't look like she's injured, but she's unconscious..."
"Let me see her right away!"
With a speed she hadn't shown before, Tipiy gently laid Shiona on the floor as if to hold her.
"Ray, turn around. I'll check Shiona's injury."
"Ah, okay... Wait, is Shiona injured!?"
"I don't know. But I'll check."
Seeing Tipiy reaching for Shiona's clothes, I quickly turned around.
Before long—
"...It's okay, no problem... She's fine, Ray."
Tipiy's tone had returned to normal.
I quietly turned back.
Shiona was breathing calmly on the lobby floor where I had laid her.
I thought she had been shot protecting me, but it seems she just lost consciousness from the gunshot at close range.
"That's good..."
I let out a sigh of relief from the bottom of my heart.
"Ray, why was Shiona shot?"
"The humans came. And they've started looting this town. Destroying buildings—"
I kept quiet about them trying to 'dispose' of the townspeople and that Mad might have already been 'processed'.
"And when I was found and about to be shot, Shiona protected me—"
I clenched my fist tightly without thinking. Tipiy looked at me sadly, and
"—I see. But if that's the case... this place might be dangerous too."
She answered with a serious face.
"Maybe we can get through it by hiding... somehow until the humans leave..."
As if to stop my words, Tipiy sadly shook her head.
"The humans found this town. A town they can live in. So, they'll come here too."
"No way... Are those guys going to settle here...?"
"Because this is a 'town'."
A town... That's right.
I also walked through the barren land until I reached here.
I was constantly on the verge of death, with no food or water.
Those humans must have traveled through such a world as well.
If so, this "town" is a paradise they could only dream of.
"But... even so, why do they have to steal? The people of this town would surely accept them."
"It's so they can live."
"It's wrong to do anything for that purpose... It's wrong to sacrifice someone else!"
"...Ray, scary..."
"Ah, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you, Tipiy..."
I unclenched the fist I had clenched in anger and stroked Tipiy's head to reassure her.
For now, let's think about Tipiy and Shiona.
If we stay in town like this, these two will also be in danger.
I really want to help everyone in town. But I can't right now. I don't have the strength or the wisdom.
I'll freeze the emotions that Shiona and the townspeople taught me for now, and mechanically... make the most efficient choice.
Let's go somewhere we can settle down for a while.
"Tipiy, let's leave the town for now. And then let's think about how to help the townspeople."
As I said that, my chest tightened.
That's because I had prioritized lives.
I had chosen the lives right in front of me, within reach.
That must be a vulgar thing to do. The weight of life is equal... and yet I'm trying to choose...
"Yeah, I think that's a good idea."
The little girl's nod lightens my guilt.
"For now, let's hide in that abandoned factory. There shouldn't be anything there that humans would want."
"Then, we need to prepare food for Ray and Shiona..."
"That's right. It would be great if we could somehow stop by the church."
The library where we are now and the church are on opposite sides of the square, at the ends of the town.
Even if we leave the town and take a big detour, we'd be easy targets in the open. On top of that, I'd be carrying Shiona.
So, do we have no choice but to proceed by crawling under the rubble again? This time Tipiy is with us, so the difficulty will be even higher...
I explained that to Tipiy as simply as possible.
"Is it difficult to go to the church?"
"Yeah... for now."
"Then, we should go under."
"...Under?"
"Yeah, under. Go under the ground to the church."
"Yeah, underground. If we go underground, no one will find us."
"Underground... Underground, huh... But how?"
"Just go inside through a manhole and go under the town like that."
...I see.
Certainly, that way we can get to the church without being found by anyone.
"That's a great idea, Tipiy! You're amazing, Tipiy."
"Ehehe... Ray praised me."
"But, where are the manholes located in the town?"
"Hmm... Ray, come here."
Tipiy took my hand and led me to a bookshelf.
Without the slightest hesitation, she came to a certain bookshelf.
"That book."
I picked up the book Tipiy pointed to and opened it.
Inside was a map showing the locations of the town's manholes and the underground waterways.
"That's amazing, Tipiy! With this, we can get to the church without any problems."
"Thank you... Ray."
Tipiy narrowed her eyes and looked happy as I stroked her head.
"Alright, Tipiy. Let's head out right away."
"Okay... but wait. I need to get ready, so just a little bit—wait?"
"Yeah, okay."
"Thank you, Ray."
With a little bow, Tipiy disappeared into the back room.
Tipiy said she was fine, but I'm still worried that she hasn't regained consciousness.
Maybe the humans didn't shoot her with a gun that fires bullets, but with a weapon that takes away physical freedom.
If I knew the cause, I'd know how to deal with it.
Is an unknown situation really this terrifying?
"Ray, sorry to keep you waiting. —What's wrong?"
Tipiy came back from the back room.
"Oh, it's nothing. I was just a little worried about Shiona."
I answered, trying to sound as calm as possible.
"So, what are you bringing?"
Tipiy, who said she had prepared, was carrying a large bag.
"A stuffed animal and... a picture book and... crayons."
"I see. They're important to you."
"And... a picture of Papa and Mama."
Tipiy said sadly.
A picture of her parents, who would likely never return.
I don't know how Tipiy feels looking at that picture.
"Um, then what's this?"
Aside from the large bag, Tipiy was carrying a thin but sturdy metal case in her hand. It felt a little too rugged for the small Tipiy to carry.
"This is... I'll tell you about it later. More importantly, Ray, let's go."
"Ah, okay..."
With Tipiy's help, I carried Shiona, who was lying on the floor, on my back. Strangely, I didn't feel her weight.
"I'm ready, Tipiy."
"Okay, then... goodbye."
Tipiy said goodbye to the countless bookshelves.
Her voice sounded somewhat sad.
I still haven't been able to heal this girl's sadness at all.
But I hadn't given up.
We'll be together from now on.
As we spend time together, even if it's little by little.
I want to heal Tipiy's sadness.
And someday, I want to see a genuine smile on Tipiy's face.
That was my quiet wish for now.
"Alright, let's go."
"—Okay."
Even so, Tipiy followed me without a single complaint.
By the time we reached the church, we were quite exhausted.
There was no sign of humans around.
We carefully looked around and stepped into the church.
The chapel was silent.
It was a silence that made the town's commotion seem like a lie.
I found a music box on the altar at the back of the chapel.
Had Shiona been listening to its melody here?
The sound of my shoes echoed loudly in the chapel as I walked towards the music box.
I approached the altar and reached for the music box.
As I turned the handle, a melody flowed out.
That melody somehow warmed the depths of my chest.
—Suddenly, I heard a singing voice.
It came from behind me.
"Welcome back."
Shiona said that and got off my back.
"That's fine. Are you hurt anywhere? Tipiy said you were okay, but..."
"Yeah, I seem to be okay."
Shiona smiled to reassure me. Then, she looked at Tipiy, who was next to her.
"Tipiy-chan... you came too."
"Yeah—"
With her usual sad expression—and yet with a look of resolve—Tipiy nodded.
"Shiona..."
Tipiy held out her palm towards Shiona, stopping her words.
"I understand... but I understand!"
Shiona looked down, as if enduring something.
"—Shiona."
In response, Tipiy was gentle, as always...
It was a completely unexpected remark. Shiona held her breath and stared into Tipiy's small eyes.
"While I was with Ray, I realized. What Shiona is trying to do."
"But, if that's the case—"
"That's part of why I came here. I can't go back to the library anymore. ...Probably not this town either."
"Tipiy-chan, I'm sorry..."
"It's okay. Shiona, you don't have to cry."
Tipiy said that as she gently hugged Shiona, who had knelt down and thrown herself into Tipiy's chest.
It was something that made me feel the illusion that Tipiy was the older sister.
"Ray, what are we going to do now?"
At Tipiy's words, I quickly came back to my senses.
"If Shiona seems okay, I want to help the townspeople. Especially the people they said they were going to dispose of—"
"Dispose?"
"Ah..."
It was a terrible way of putting it... A way of speaking that didn't see other humans as humans.
"Can you do that, Ray?"
"I don't know, but—even so, I can't just stand by and watch people who are about to be killed right in front of me."
"But, Ray, it's dangerous."
"Yeah, I know that, but..."
They're the kind of people who would point guns at you without hesitation. There's nothing I can do if I challenge them head-on.
I'm sure we wouldn't even be able to talk things out.
"I promise. If it gets even a little dangerous, I'll definitely turn back."
"Absolutely. If Ray gets hurt—everything will be irreversible."
"Yeah. I can't leave Shiona behind either."
"Ray..."
"Shiona—"
With that one word, we separated as if magnets had repelled each other.
"S-Sorry! It's not like I forgot about Tipiy-chan!"
"Only Shiona gets to be unfair..."
Tipiy said that, pouting her lips slightly.
"I'm sorry, Tipiy. I didn't mean to..."
I apologized as I gently stroked Tipiy's head.
"Muu... That's not it..."
Even as she said that, Tipiy's expression wasn't entirely displeased.
Seeing that, Shiona laughed first—then I, and Tipiy, also smiled.
And so, we laughed together.
Without a word, the three of us held hands.
We squeezed each other's hands tightly, as if we would never be separated again.
And before that resolve could waver, I declared.
"From now on, let's always be together, the three of us. Always—"
But, as if to mock me...
Footsteps echoed in the distance.
Shiona's smile, Tipiy's smile, stiffened.
I'm sure mine did too.
All the townspeople have been captured.
Then, the ones heading towards this church right now are—
Without a doubt, humans.
I was the first to move. I looked out the window, making sure not to make a sound.
There was one silhouette. However, I didn't know how many would follow.
"Shiona, Tipiy, to the back of the chapel. Crouch down as much as possible, so you can't be seen from outside."
"Okay, but wouldn't it be better to lock the door first?"
"No. If we do that, they'll definitely call for backup. If that happens, we won't stand a chance."
I want to neutralize the human outside without making any noise.
If there's only one opponent, I think I can manage. If there are two, I might be able to do something with a surprise attack.
But if there are three or more—I haven't told Shiona or Tipiy, but I was prepared to be captured alone.
I crept forward, hiding my footsteps, and stood in the shadow of the door. In the meantime, the footsteps were getting closer and closer.
The number is one. For now, there are no others following.
"...Haa..."
I quietly took a deep breath and braced myself.
I held my breath. The footsteps were—right next to me.
The door slowly opened.
Then a man with a pistol slowly entered.
—Now!
In that instant, I swung my arm down with all my might from the blind spot.
Immediately, I kicked the pistol that had fallen to the floor.
At the same time, I also attempted a leg sweep, but he managed to dodge that, as expected.
We were still at a distance where we were almost touching.
It's probably safe to assume he has weapons other than a gun.
Then, if I aim for the moment he reaches for one, I can catch him off guard.
But the man quietly tilted his head and looked at me.
"You, what do you think you're doing?"
He asked in a flat voice.
"Why do you oppose us? Are you the owner of this town?"
"Owner? I just want to do what's best for the people of this town."
"That sounds just like a Philoid."
"...So what... That's my reason for existing."
As I said that, I took off the glove on my right hand and showed him my mechanical hand.
It's not a good idea to fight me head-on with a mechanical body.
If I can make him think that, he might back down.
Right now, as long as I can ensure Shiona and Tipiy's safety, that's all that matters. Even if they find out my true identity, I will protect what I want to protect.
That is my role as a Philoid.
At my actions, the man tilted his head again.
"What are you talking about? Philoids cannot engage in any combat actions. They are built to obey commands so they cannot defy humans."
"Huh?"
"Either way, you are an anomaly trapped by the ideas of the old era. I will eliminate you before you become a source of trouble."
The tip of the blade was thrust straight at my throat.
I grabbed the blade of the knife with my mechanical right hand. Then, I put all my strength into it and twisted it hard.
With just that, the knife blade snapped off at the base.
I then used my entire body weight to push the opponent down. I pressed my left elbow against his throat and pinned both his legs with my knees—
"Ray!"
Shiona jumped out from the back of the room.
Holding down the opponent's throat again with my left hand, and raising my exposed metal right hand, I said.
This metal arm can even break a knife. If I swing it down on his head with full force, he won't get away unharmed.
"Ray, stop."
Shiona pleaded in a trembling voice.
—But.
Clenching my back teeth, I put all my strength into it—and swung my right hand down.
My right hand was half-buried.
Not in the man's head, but in the floor right next to it.
"Why spare me? Considering your own safety, killing me is the correct choice."
The man said that, still expressionless.
"That's not true. No matter the reason, the choice to kill is wrong."
"Incorrigible. Such an inefficient way of thinking."
"I'll take you hostage. And I'll have you release the townspeople."
I grabbed the opponent by the collar and pulled him up.
"That is precisely meaningless. My life has no such value. If dying now opens the future for my brethren, there is no reason to regret it."
Without changing his tone at all, the man took something out of his pocket.
It was an old-fashioned bomb. The moment he pulled the safety pin, he grabbed my arm.
"What!"
I instinctively pulled my arm back, but it didn't budge.
A chill ran down my spine.
Why is this human not showing any emotion on his face, even at this moment when he is about to end his own life?
It was as if I was bound by the color of his eyes, which seemed devoid of will.
—No! If I stop thinking, it's over!
I instantly switched my mind and began to analyze the situation.
What the man has is a really small bomb, about the size of a small fruit.
However, as long as it's a bomb, it will have lethal power, and above all, there is a risk of the humans staying in town noticing the loud noise.
When? When will it explode?
The opponent is probably planning to self-destruct. It's certain that there isn't much time.
But what should I do? If the explosion is large, Shiona and the others who are hiding will also be harmed.
It's impossible to neutralize this bomb, so what's the way to minimize its effect?
I reflexively hugged the man. In a way that sandwiched the bomb.
If I do this, I might be able to protect Shiona and the others from the blast, at least. It might be imperfect, but it seems like the best choice.
At least the two of them—
The next moment, an impact came.
From the side. Like being pushed away... no, that's different, I was pushed away!
Rolling on the floor, I looked at the place where I had been.
There, Shiona was holding the bomb.
"Shiona!"
"Get down!"
The bomb she was clutching exploded with a strong light and sound.
Perhaps the scale of the explosion wasn't that large because it was a type of bomb not intended for killing.
Even so, I, who was at close range, was directly hit by the blast and sound and felt dizzy.
The human who was also at close range was unconscious.
"Shiona!"
I shouted, my vision swaying.
Please, please be safe.
"Shiona!?"
"...Ray..."
"Shio...na..."
"Shiona, let's treat that right away!"
A distance of a few steps felt incredibly long.
Slapping my unsteady legs, I approached Shiona.
And then, I saw it.
"What... is this...?"
I was speechless when I saw Shiona.
Her right arm was thrown onto the floor... from the wrist down... a metallic—frame?
It wasn't bone. Absolutely not. It was clearly different from a human's.
And—it wasn't there.
Something was wrong.
What should have been there, wasn't.
Red.
That was the proof of a human.
"Wh-wh-why..."
"B-but..."
I clenched my mechanical right hand, covered by a glove.
Yes, if it were the same... if only it were the same...
"Shiona, are you... are you okay?"
"Yeah, this much is fine."
That can't be true.
There's no way that's true.
She took the full force of the explosion at such close range.
There's no way she's okay.
It must be incredibly painful, so painful she can't help but cry.
And yet.
And yet, why?
"More than me... Ray, your head."
I followed Shiona's gaze and put my hand to my head.
—Ah, why is this happening?
Why do I have what Shiona needs?
I don't need this.
I don't need this, so I wished Shiona had it instead.
No, she should have had it.
Shiona touched my head and said.
"You're bleeding, are you okay?"
Blood was flowing from my head.
Red.
Red blood.
Something that doesn't flow in a Philoid...
In contrast, not a single drop of blood flowed from Shiona's arm.
Instead, exposed mechanical parts were visible.
This means only one thing.
That is—.
"...Ray? There was a loud noise, are you okay—Shiona!? Ray!?"
Tippy, who had come out from the back, screamed.
Her expression was anxious, and large tears welled up in her eyes.
"We both have to heal our injuries...!"
"It's okay... I'm okay..."
I gently wrapped my arms around Tippy, who was on the verge of panic.
Held in my arms, Tippy's face relaxed slightly against my chest.
But it was a fragile relief.
Seeing her look like she could break down at any moment made my chest ache.
"Ray... let's move, we can't stay here anymore..."
Tippy said in a trembling voice. Shiona nodded in agreement.
Certainly, after that explosion, other humans would definitely come.
There were so many things I wanted to ask.
So many things I wanted to confirm.
But, I swallowed them for now.
"...Let's go, let's leave town."
We took only the bare minimum of luggage and left the church.
Then, following Tippy's instructions, we used the back alleys of the town to escape outside and headed for the abandoned factory.
There, too, I was made to realize...
That I was the only one whose steps grew heavy from exhaustion...
Led by Tippy and pulled by Shiona's hand, I kept walking.
We reached the abandoned factory, and finally, I sat down on the ground.
Next to Shiona, who looked cool and collected, I regulated my ragged breathing.
"Tippy, I'll get some water."
The small girl glanced at Shiona and then disappeared into the back of the abandoned factory.
She probably entrusted all the explanations to Shiona.
"...Shiona."
At my voice, Shiona returned a slightly troubled smile.
"I think you've already realized, but I'm... no. Everyone living in this town is a Philoid."
That was... something I had been trying to avoid seeing.
I had a premonition... I felt a sense of unease... but it was something I didn't want to admit...
"So... I'm a 'Human'?
When my head was injured, a red liquid leaked from the injured area.
It was very similar to the 'blood' that flows through a human body.
Philoids don't have such a liquid installed, so it shouldn't flow.
"You've been misunderstanding because of your mechanical arm... that's a medical artificial part to supplement limbs lost in an accident or something."
"No way... then I'm really..."
"Yes, you are a Human. The creator and partner of us Philoids. That is you. Everyone in town is a Philoid. Only you were a Human."
"I see..."
I stared at my mechanical right hand covered by a glove and weakly clenched it.
The existence I had thought I was until now was the complete opposite...
Shiona was a Philoid... and I was a Human...
—In other words, I am the very existence I should hate: a Human.
I felt something deep in my chest.
That emotion was painful.
Sad.
And infuriating.
I was the same existence as those cold, merciless, and seemingly evil beings.
My chest tightened unbearably.
I felt anger at the unchangeable truth.
What the man I had just been fighting said was right.
I wasn't a Philoid, I was a Human.
And they, the Humans who were the rulers, were going to do terrible things to the Philoids, the ruled people of this town—no, they were probably already doing them.
Why did things turn out this way?
All I wanted was to live with Shiona and the people of this town.
All I wanted was to make everyone happy.
But, but, but—
I can't do that.
That's because I'm a Human.
That's because I'm one of those hopeless creatures.
I felt warmth in the fist I had unconsciously clenched.
When I lowered my gaze, I saw Shiona's hand placed over mine.
That temperature was artificial.
But it didn't matter to me.
...It's warm.
Just that alone, the emotions that had been weighing on my heart faded.
But at the same time, it highlighted my own helplessness.
Did I even deserve her kindness?
"Do you want to know more? About you guys?"
Shiona smiled at me and said.
"'You guys'? You mean Humans?"
"Yes, Humans. Do you want to know about our partners?"
If I could know, I wanted to know.
So I nodded.
"I want to know... I want to know why we became like this."
"Ray, do you remember the pictures Tippy-chan drew in the library?"
"Ah, I remember..."
"Those pictures, Tippy-chan draws them every day. Every single day, no matter what, one picture a day."
I closed my eyelids and recalled that scene.
There were dozens, even hundreds, of those crayon drawings.
"How many do you think there are?"
"I don't know... If Tippy is a Philoid, she's been drawing for years... Maybe around a thousand?"
"Eighty-six thousand six hundred seventy-one."
"Eighty-six—"
Again, a strong dizziness assaulted me. But it wasn't from the explosion earlier, or the bleeding that followed.
Had Tippy spent such a long time, all alone, in that dark library?
Hardly anyone ever came to that library.
It must have been a lonely everyday life.
Thinking about the time Tippy had spent there, I felt a fear as if the ground beneath me was disappearing.
And Tippy had endured that.
With that small body.
"Decades before that, we Philoids were born. Desired by Humans—"
Shiona told me the history of the Philoids as if singing a song.
First, Philoids were androids that had reached the practical stage, equipped with human emotions.
Basic emotional information was installed from the beginning, and a self-learning thought circuit allowed them to learn new emotions thereafter.
Including that, it's fair to say they were as close to Humans as possible.
Therefore, not only in work but also in daily life, they could become beings extremely close to Humans.
Eventually, companies that installed custom-made emotions and memories appeared, and an unprecedented Philoid boom arrived.
It was the dawn of an era where families who couldn't have children would buy child Philoids, and those who had lost parents or children would order Philoids with those memories.
The number of Philoids increased rapidly, and in just over a decade, a number comparable to the human population was produced.
Among them, what was groundbreaking was the Philoid equipped with 'love,' considered the most complex human emotion.
It had the ability to serve as a life partner.
One could obtain a loved one without going through the process of romance, and that love was guaranteed semi-permanently.
In a society where late marriages were increasing and more Humans prioritized work over romance, the demand was significant and it was accepted with applause.
However, families who married Philoids did not have children, which accelerated the declining birthrate.
And the declining birthrate created a shortage of marriage partners, leading to a loop where marriages with Philoids further increased.
"And, before they knew it, Humans forgot. How to nurture love."
Shiona smiled sadly.
"Human children came to be created artificially using science. But Humans who had lost love couldn't teach love to the children who were born."
Love was the origin of all emotions.
Because there is love, you feel the joy of connecting with someone.
Because there is love, you know what you want to protect and feel anger when it is hurt.
Because there is love, you feel sadness when you lose something important.
Because there is love... you share, divide, and find joy in the same emotions.
But—... they forgot that.
The Humans who came to town are probably those kinds of "Humans."
Humans who forgot "emotions" along with love, lost even the heart to care for others.
Humans no longer needed love, and they began to find the existence of Philoids with emotions bothersome.
When considering efficiency of action, they were too wasteful... they thought.
Humans eventually came to believe that Philoids should be machines.
They deliberately sent them into harsh environments... dangerous tasks... abuse beyond their specifications...
However, there were also Humans who did not approve of this.
Humans who retained the emotion of love protested. They said Philoids were partners.
The world was divided into two.
Humans who had love, and Humans who did not.
And the Humans who did not have it concluded.
That the ideology of the old generation was foolish, that it should be annihilated...
They didn't even hesitate to press the button on the weapon that would burn the earth.
After that, everything happened quickly.
Retaliation begot retaliation, and it didn't take even 5 days for the world to be engulfed in flames and ash.
The contaminated, poisoned land, the black clouds blocking the sunlight, the sea that could not nourish life.
The history of Humans would meet its end by their own hands...
It was too foolish a choice.
"We, who were born for Humans, took away the most important thing from Humans."
"That's not true... It's all our fault, us Humans..."
"But you know, many Humans survived. No matter how ruined the world became, life doesn't stop moving forward."
I couldn't find the words to reply to Shiona, who was speaking to me so gently.
"...Ahem, ah—, ah——, ah—"
Suddenly, Shiona started doing vocal exercises.
And then, facing me directly as I looked at her in confusion—
"Nice to meet you. I am Asou International made, MODA-117 Alice mk-17. Have you completed user registration? If you have completed registration, please decide my individual name. It is the first name given to me. Please choose carefully!"
—I was caught completely off guard.
It was the first time I had seen her like this... well, that's one way to put it, but it was the first time I had seen Shiona so utterly bright and innocent.
"Were you surprised?"
Back to her usual self, Shiona asked.
"U-Uh..."
"That just now, is my oldest memory."
I wonder when that was. I can't even imagine.
"Back then, every day was like a festival... it was really lively."
Saying that, Shiona showed me a piece of paper that seemed to be a newspaper clipping.
"World-Renowned Musician, Passes Away"
The photo shown was the same one that was in the picture frame in Shiona's room.
It belonged to someone with a face similar to mine.
"Is this... your brother?"
"Yes, this story is also from a long time ago... You see, I'm the latest model among the Philoids that were manufactured. Fifth generation, I think."
How does Shiona feel, expressing herself as 'manufactured'?
Philoids have emotions, just like Humans.
In other words, they are the same as Humans.
Can it really be compartmentalized so easily?
"My generation is the first model to be equipped with the concept of human 'death'. To get as close to Humans as possible. But models before me don't have that... Mad-san and Tippy-chan are like that. Neither of them can understand 'death'. It's useless to explain it. The day they understand will never come."
To wait without knowing death.
It's a hope, but it's a hope that will never be fulfilled.
Despair in the name of hope.
They are unconditionally confronted with that.
If they're going to be confronted with something like that, wouldn't it be better to teach them despair from the beginning?
I thought it would be better that way, if it were me.
"Tippy-chan is an even older model... I think she was a second-generation Philoid. Second-generation models can't extract energy from food. That's why they run on electricity. But there's a limit to the battery's operating time. She carries that bear plushie as a backup battery."
Thinking back, Tippy always had the plushie in her hand whenever she moved somewhere.
I had no idea it was a battery.
But that explained something.
The fact that Tippy was always in that library.
That library is the only place in town with a power generation system.
Tippy stayed there to continue her activities.
"Tippy-chan's parents also passed away a long time ago. Probably over 200 years ago. But Tippy-chan, who has no concept of death, is waiting. All alone, forever and ever."
What a cruel story.
I don't know the lifespan of a Philoid, but Tippy has spent hundreds of years like that.
Every single day, shedding tears.
Trapped by a hope that cannot be fulfilled—... a future that will never come.
In that library, all alone.
It feels like there's a lead ball in the pit of my stomach.
It's painful and hurts.
But the more I think about it, the deeper it sinks inside me.
"But, it's painful even if you know."
And Shiona recognizes death. Meaning, she can't even hold onto the hope of possibly meeting again.
"You saw Mad-san collapse at the general store, right, Rei?"
"Yeah... it was strange. It was like his soul just left him, even though there were no external injuries—"
I understand now. Mad-san at that time was already broken.
"But, we have to keep living like this. Until our death—until we break. For us, who don't get sick, that's a time equivalent to eternity. That's why we try to be Human. Wouldn't it be too sad otherwise? We take over the jobs our partners were doing, or fill in for positions that are gone... like Humans used to, we keep the world turning. So that this world, which Humans kept turning, never stops."
Mad-san ran the general store.
The photo studio, the bar, various shops lined the town.
All of that was the work of the Philoids.
It was the effort of the Philoids to protect the Human world.
It was the last hope of the Philoids who were left behind.
"So that when Humans return someday, we can talk about and return the world from those fun times, we spend every day."
Shiona smiled.
An emotion that didn't fit the current situation at all.
With that smile, Shiona was protecting herself.
That smile looked sad to me.
"...But, we Philoids also have a flaw. That is, if something is unbearably painful, only a certain emotion comes to the forefront. I'm like this, Mad-san is always angry, and Tippy-chan is always sad."
But, Shiona continued.
That's our last line of defense. If even that emotion disappears, we'll break... we'll die.
Then, Mad-san when Shiona was shot—
That's right. He didn't go on a journey. After you finished showing him that movie, Mad-san broke—no, he stopped moving.
Then, who closed the shop—Shiona?
Yeah. I thought if I didn't, Rei would have questions, let alone the townspeople. And that's what happened, right?
Well, yeah, but...
If the shop had remained open there, I definitely would have gone inside and found Mad-san, who had stopped moving.
If the Humans hadn't come, I'm sure I never would have noticed.
In the end, it was confirmed that I hadn't been mistaken after all.
I didn't want to believe it, but that was the truth.
My brother used to say, 'Emotions are pieces of the puzzle called life.' The pieces of emotion connect life. If emotions are missing, all the pieces will crumble. That's the same for Humans and Philoids. Mad-san broke because the emotion of anger towards his son dissipated.
If that's the case, then I killed Mad-san.
I found the playback device on my own and showed Mad-san his son's movie on my own.
If I hadn't done something like that, Mad-san should have kept moving without breaking.
Perhaps sensing my feelings, Shiona moved to my left side and placed her hand over mine.
It's okay, it's not your fault, Rei. Sooner or later, we're destined to become like that. It's the same as Humans not being able to escape death. Mad-san was surely happy. To be able to know his son's true feelings in the end.
Maybe so. But—
A sense of helplessness builds up.
If I had known that at the time—I would have stopped it, even if I had to force him.
You're kind, Rei—
That's not true...
Shiona stood next to me.
I couldn't see Shiona's expression.
Anxiety pounded against my chest from the inside.
Because even if you know, you still wish for it. You wish that someday, you might see that smile again.
Looking down at the photo of her brother, Shiona smiled sadly.
That's why, when I first met Rei, I was so happy. Ah, it was just a dream after all. My brother was alive.
Dying.
Whether you knew it or not, both were painful.
Created in a way that was convenient for Humans, forced to have families, and then leaving behind only the pain of death.
Selfish and terrible.
That was us, Humans.
Tippy-chan feels the loneliness of losing her family. That's why, if she acts like family, she'll 'die'. That's not to say I don't want you to say such things to Rei. We Philoids have a rule that we shouldn't act in ways that 'make us realize we are Philoids'. That's because it would destroy the Humans' dream. But, I went too far... I'm sorry.
When Shiona lowered her head, a sweet scent wafted gently.
Certainly, what Shiona did probably isn't forgivable.
However, when considering Shiona's feelings, it was also clear that that method was the most appropriate.
It can't be helped. Shiona just followed the rules, she didn't do anything wrong.
This is how someone forgives someone else, and someone else is forgiven.
Apologizing, and being apologized to.
Crying, getting angry, and laughing.
That's what it means to be Human.
They, being Philoids, knew that best of all.
Thank you for telling me, Shiona. For being so kind to me, a Human—
As a Human, I felt sorry.
To be treating the Philoids who were so devoted like this, returning their kindness with hostility.
Even as I was doing this, Humans might be 'disposing' of Philoids in town.
And the Philoids probably wouldn't be able to offer much resistance to that.
Thinking that, I couldn't hide the pain deep in my chest.
Shiona gently extended her arms and pulled me into an embrace.
Warm warmth enveloped me.
Of course. Humans and Philoids have always been partners, in the past and now. And it's decided that it will be that way far into the future too.
I felt like the emotion I couldn't understand until the end was there.
It was warm, vast, deep, strong, gentle, soft, big, and precious.
Humans had lost something tremendous.
But, for what Humans had forgotten, they had remembered it for us.
For years, for decades, for centuries.
While enduring loneliness, they had continued to protect us.
I felt like I had to inherit that and protect them in the same way.
It wasn't an obligation or a command.
It was something I myself desired.
"I'm home, there was pretty water."
As I was sharing body heat with Shiona, Tippy called out to me from behind.
For some reason, I felt embarrassed and instinctively put distance between Shiona and me.
The warmth that had been touching my skin was snatched away by the air.
But, that gap was immediately filled with new warmth.
Looking, I saw that Tippy had squeezed in between me and Shiona.
"Tippy too—hug."
Shiona and I exchanged glances.
Shiona seemed to be leaving the decision to me.
Tippy had lived in loneliness for two hundred years.
If things stayed like this, Tippy would be able to live semi-permanently without breaking.
But, would that be happy?
Does an empty life have value?
I hugged Shiona close.
Including Tippy, who was standing between us.
Shiona also hugged me in the same way.
Tippy hugged both of us and murmured softly.
"Warm..."
It was warmth after two hundred years.
Tippy had been waiting for something so trivial for two hundred years.
It was a very sad time...
If I could give her two hundred years' worth of warmth, I would definitely want to give it to Tippy.
Because if I did, I feel like I could say that the time Tippy waited wasn't wasted.
"What are you going to do now, Rei?"
Shiona asked me, still holding Tippy from behind.
"If possible... I still want to help everyone in town... but I don't think I can right now."
I feel sorry for the townspeople, but I don't have the power to do that.
First, I want to ensure the safety of Shiona and Tippy.
"It's a bit far, but let's go to the factory where I woke up."
No, that wasn't a factory.
It was a facility where people slept until the contaminated land of a world made uninhabitable by war became even slightly better.
My... awakening was a little delayed.
"There, the electricity was still working. Shiona and I can take things orally, so we can manage if we have food we took from town. But in Tippy's case, she needs to be charged."
"Shiona..."
She must have realized just from those words. Tippy spoke up.
"Yeah, that's right. ...I'm sorry."
"No. I thought I had to say it soon."
With a somewhat sad, yet slightly firm expression, Tippy continued.
"Tippy also has to do what Tippy can... while I still can."
"...Tippy-chan?"
Shiona must have caught onto something, and she questioned Tippy.
"Let's survive, the three of us."
They were words without a destination.
There were no guarantees.
Even so, I could only continue those words.
"We'll survive, the three of us, forever and ever."
It was just an ideal.
I knew the world wasn't sweet enough to live on ideals alone.
Of course, Shiona must have known that too.
Even so, Shiona didn't question me at all.
Anxiety and dissatisfaction.
She had sealed away all those words.
Surely her heart must have been filled with them.
In fact, my heart was being ravaged by those emotions.
Even so, it was necessary.
Words of hope.
"...Yeah."
Shiona nodded and hugged me and Tippy even tighter.
And so, we began our journey towards the facility.
"This is... outside the town..."
Seeing the wasteland before her eyes, Tippy hugged her bear plushie to her chest.
"Is it different from the scenery Tippy knows?"
"Yeah. When I saw it before, there was a road, and a forest, and then—and then—"
The scenery Tippy described was an even larger-scale version of the festival-like days Shiona had told me about.
It seems that back then, humans could freely control not only towns but also nature, Philoids, and even the weather.
"In that case... by the time I started operating, humans had already begun to decline..."
Shiona looked a little sad. The hem of her clothes flapped wildly in the dust-laden wind.
"Alright, let's go!"
With a little food and a spare battery for Tippy, we started walking through the wasteland to survive.
And more than anything, to live through it.
Struggle, struggle, and live through it.
Writhe, writhe, and stay alive.
As long as we're alive, that's enough.
Just being alive had value.
I truly felt that way.
Using the position of the sun, faintly visible through the dim clouds, as a guide, I walked while searching my memory.
As the sun set and the temperature dropped, the three of us huddled together and fell asleep.
Sometimes singing songs, sometimes encouraging each other, sometimes joking around...
We continued a journey that wasn't just difficult.
We reached our destination across the reddish-brown land after exactly three days, just as the sun began to set.
"Half the building is buried in sand... No wonder we couldn't find it. To think a facility like this was still here..."
As we entered the interior, a faint light came on, and the air conditioning hummed faintly from somewhere.
The room was exactly the same as when I woke up. For now, I gathered up the Philoid parts, which would likely be unpleasant for Shiona and Tippy, and put them away.
These Philoids must have been protecting us humans who were in cold sleep.
"Yay, I can sit down!"
Tippy ran ahead and was the first to sit on the sofa that had been set up.
As soon as she sat down, the strength drained from her body.
It seemed I had pushed her quite hard.
"...It's kind of cold here."
"That's because it's originally a facility for cold sleep."
Even though we're indoors, it's a little colder than outside.
Since the air conditioning is working, I want to believe that the function to raise the temperature inside the facility also remains.
But I don't know where that is.
"It'd be nice if there was a heater or something..."
"Here's what we'll do. Rei, sit next to Tippy-chan."
"Like this?"
"Closer!"
"L-like this?"
When I asked that, in a position almost pressed against Tippy, Shiona had a satisfied look on her face and said,
"Yeah, this will be fine!"
And she sat down on the opposite side of where she was pressed against Tippy.
—Pressed tightly, just like me and Tippy.
"See, this way it's warm, right?"
"Y-yeah... you're right."
It's certainly warm. It's warm, but...
"How is it, Tippy-chan? Are you still cold?"
"Mmm... warm."
Tippy narrowed her eyes and snuggled against my arm.
"Warm? Really? That's good."
"Yeah, warm... it's really warm, Rei. It's like..."
"Like, what?"
"When we're like this, it feels like a family."
"............"
"Tippy's papa and mama used to hug Tippy like this a lot."
"Yeah. It's warm, just like back then."
"...You're right, it is warm."
"...Hey, hug me again? Squeeze Tippy tight?"
I almost hugged her without thinking, but I felt Shiona's sad gaze and stopped my hand.
"Tippy-chan, you can't do that."
"Why? Won't you hug me tight?"
"Yes, that's right. Because Tippy-chan, we're not family or anything."
"Not family... Is Tippy all alone?"
"Yes. No matter how much time we spend together, you're alone. That's something that can't be changed."
If you only pick up the words, they were cold, as if she disliked Tippy.
But now I understand.
Those words were filled with kindness.
The only emotion remaining within Tippy.
—Sadness.
To fill Tippy's heart with anything else would be to free her from sadness...
In other words, it would be equivalent to dying.
Until now, I had hugged Tippy without thinking about anything.
But perhaps that was a kindness that was far too cruel.
No, perhaps it wasn't even kindness.
It was merely a self-satisfied act that only shortened Tippy's lifespan.
Shiona had been enduring it all this time.
To protect Tippy's emotion of sadness... and more than anything, to protect Tippy.
She must have truly wanted to hug her.
She must have wanted to stroke her head and say gentle words.
She must have wanted to give her a smile that would turn her heart orange.
Without reaching out to this blue girl, she had endured it all along.
So, I thought I had to endure it too.
Even though I thought that—... I couldn't stop my hand.
I just couldn't bring myself to leave this girl with the sad expression in front of me alone.
I pulled Tippy close, Shiona and all.
My eyes felt hot.
Even though I knew this was an act that would shorten Tippy's lifespan, I asked myself why I couldn't stop.
Wasn't I just temporarily satisfying my own desires...?
As expected, I'm a human...
A selfish human, filled with self-interest, who hurts others.
I hugged them both so tightly it hurt.
I held their combined warmth close.
As if to fill two hundred years of emptiness, we brought our warmth closer.
The warmth of the three of us, even in the chilled facility, didn't make us feel the cold.
It was that warm.
A melody naturally spilled from Shiona's lips.
That song her older brother made.
That melody lights a warmth deep within my chest.
Her gentle singing voice echoed through the factory.
"Tippy, I really love this song Shiona sings,"
Tippy said, burying her face in my chest.
"It reminds me of when Papa and Mama were here... and somehow, the tears just won't stop."
The girl repeating her sadness.
Tippy has been repeating that sadness for two hundred years.
Perhaps I can't wipe away two hundred years of that sadness.
But I can give her this moment of warmth.
I decided to hug them both, pouring two hundred years' worth into this fleeting warmth.
But that brief moment didn't last long.
"Huh... Tippy?"
I looked at Tippy, who was sitting on the sofa.
There she was, staring blankly ahead.
"What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?"
"Mmm? ...Mmm..."
She seemed to be lacking energy.
Was it because the tension was gone, or because she had walked for so long?
Either way, she seemed to need rest.
"Tippy seems tired too, so maybe we should rest soon for today."
"...U-uh, okay."
Her reply was a beat late. She seemed to have been thinking about something.
"Rei, Tippy-chan might be low on energy. That's why she might be distracted."
"I see... Then we need to recharge her. —Huh, how do we do that?"
"It's contactless charging. The charging equipment should be standard, so first we need to find the connector and store electricity in the bear plushie."
"Got it. If I find something that looks like it, I'll ask you to check."
"Leave it to me."
Leaving Tippy on the sofa, I checked the things inside the facility.
Rows and rows of cold sleep devices. I looked for ones that were still leaking cold air.
Then, I opened the maintenance cover at the base and examined several cables connected to the distribution board.
Before long, I found something like a power connector connected to a thick cable.
"Yeah, this type is fine. Let me borrow Tippy-chan's plushie."
Shiona borrowed the bear plushie from Tippy, opened the zipper on its back, and exposed the connection terminal.
When she inserted the charging connector there, the bear's eyes blinked twice.
That must have been the signal to start charging, Shiona breathed a sigh of relief.
Tippy also squeezed the bear's hand tightly. Just doing that must have transferred power, as the light in her eyes seemed to strengthen.
"Shiona, let's eat too."
I showed them the oral blocks I found when I was looking for the charging cable.
It was the same thing I found when we left the facility.
"The taste can't compare to Shiona's soup, but I think it has nutrients."
"No, I'm happy because I was hungry. Just being able to eat makes my chest feel warm."
I lined up the portable plates and placed the oral blocks on them.
I thought it would look a little more like a meal this way.
Because it was a time like this, I wanted to cherish everyday things, even the small ones.
I wanted to replicate, even a little, what we did in that town—at Shiona's house.
"It looks delicious."
As if understanding my wish, Shiona smiled at me.
We put our hands together before the meal.
Seeing this, Tippy came over to us.
And placing the bear plushie in front of her, she put her hands together just like us.
"Together with everyone."
"Tippy-chan...?"
"Haha, Tippy, that's a great feast. It's very luxurious."
Tippy showed a shy, embarrassed smile.
In these past few days, which had been full of hardship, this was a moment of peace for my heart.
Surely in the distant past, we humans must have lived like this with our partners, the Philoids.
No, it should be a life we can still reclaim now.
Just as I, who had lost my emotions, was taught by them... I should be able to reclaim the time I had forgotten...
I carried the oral blocks remaining on the plate to my mouth, thinking such things.
—It was then.
"Warning. Main battery wear rate exceeds 90%. Please perform battery replacement and maintenance immediately."
Suddenly, in a businesslike tone, Tippy said something like that.
"Initiating online replacement request to the service center—Service center is offline. Retrying.—Service center is offline. Retrying.—Service center is offline. Retrying..."
"Shiona, this is—!"
"I don't know the details, but Tippy-chan's battery can't be charged anymore."
"Can't be charged..."
Was the voltage different? No, that shouldn't be a problem since it's going through the bear plushie.
In that case, is there a problem with the battery itself?
If there's a possibility... could it be deterioration over time? Come to think of it, it's a battery that's been operating for over 200 years.
It wouldn't be strange for it to be completely worn out.
"We might need a new battery..."
"A brand new battery... And for Tippy-chan's generation, you had to have a specialized technician disassemble it once to replace it...!"
"No way..."
Cold sweat ran down my back.
In other words, Tippy will stop functioning like this—no, will she die?
"No, we came all this way...!"
"It's okay... I knew this would happen."
At Tippy's voice, which had returned to her usual tone, we could only stare as if struck by lightning.
"Tippy-chan, did you perhaps know this would happen—"
"Yeah... I thought this would happen since I left the library. I also noticed that the battery charge rate had been dropping for 6427 days."
Tippy replied, smiling weakly.
"More importantly, Tippy has to do what Tippy can... Rei, can you bring me the metal bag Tippy was carrying?"
"O-Okay!"
The slim but somewhat rugged metal bag that Tippy had been carrying ever since she left the library. Holding the bag, which was heavier than expected, I brought it to Tippy.
Tippy placed one hand casually in the center of the bag. With just that, the two locks on the handle side automatically unlocked.
—Inside was a single black plate. Its size was perhaps about that of a slightly large book. However, it was much thinner, only about half the thickness of a short picture book.
Tippy carefully took it out with both hands, then slowly turned back towards me.
"Rei. Put your palm here. The one that's not mechanical."
"Like this?"
As Tippy told me, I placed my non-prosthetic hand on the jet-black plate. Then—
A fluent male voice echoed from the black plate.
"Current administrator, Vortex Corporation MSK-3737 model name 'Dorothy' individual name 'Tippy' approves continuation of work. Continue registration process."
"Confirmed. Registration applicant, please state the name to identify the individual."
"Um... Rei."
"Understood. 《Rei》 has been registered as a new administrator. Please receive verbal instructions on usage from the current administrator. End of message."
After saying that, the black plate fell silent.
"Tippy, that was..."
"All the books in the library, digitized. It's the backup data of Tippy's memory area."
Tippy replied in a tone that sounded a little tired—yet as if she had accomplished something.
I remembered the many handwritten books lined up in the library.
Tippy, who remembered every single word written there without a mistake.
As I thought, Tippy was the one who wrote those books.
Even if she were to stop functioning someday... no, predicting that she would stop, so that she could leave a record of the prehistoric civilization as books.
That place wasn't the library. Tippy herself was the library.
"When you use it, put your hand in the center of the plate, just like before. Then the tablet—the plate—will light up. After that, you'll be able to access all the data using the administrator's voice recognition function..."
"Then—"
As Tippy told me, I activated the plate, which she called a tablet. As instructed, I placed my palm on it.
"Biometrics confirmed, administrator Rei authenticated. Which data would you like to load?"
"The manual! How to repair a Philoid... um, how to replace the battery!"
"Search initiated... There are 3195 items and 124,751 types of information regarding Philoid repair methods. Narrowing down is recommended."
"From those, the Vortex Corporation MSK-3737 model 'Dorothy'."
"Search initiated... Conditions matched."
The surface of the tablet lit up brightly. And text appeared.
"User repair is nearly impossible. Please keep the unit at rest until personnel from the service center arrive."
Everything in front of me went dark.
"How is it, is it working well?"
"Ah, it's working... but..."
"That tablet... will only... work... for about fifty more years..."
It was more than enough time for me, but for a Philoid, and as a library management system, it probably wasn't that long.
"Are you sure I can use it?"
"Rather, please use it. From now on... Tippy won't be useful..."
"That's not true! You've always been helping me, Tippy!"
When I fixed Shiona's music box, when I fixed Mr. Mad's projector. Those were all things I could do because Tippy had perfectly memorized the library's collection and taught me.
"Hearing you say that, Rei, makes me happy—Please use this from now on..."
Tippy, who was sitting on the sofa, slowly lay down.
"Tippy!"
"Tippy-chan!"
She had waited for 200 years.
It shouldn't end here.
Tippy's small mouth moved up and down, opening and closing.
She seemed to be saying something, but her voice was too quiet for me to hear.
I leaned my ear closer to her mouth.
"Hey, Rei... Tippy, I had fun."
Tippy's hand was placed on top of mine.
Her hand was small and soft.
Rei is my dad, and Shiona is my mom... Both of you are kind, and my favorite family.
No matter how coldly I treated them, how much I pushed them away, I couldn't completely hide my true feelings.
Tippy had noticed.
How much we cherished Tippy.
From the moment we got involved, it was decided that Tippy would end up like this.
And that there was nothing we could do about it.
Being alone forever was the only way Tippy could survive.
But that's impossible, isn't it?
Tippy has emotions.
We're not perfect enough to overlook sadness.
No, that's not what you call perfect.
Because we can feel sadness, we are allowed to have emotions.
Slowly.
Like a handkerchief sinking into the water's surface, Tippy's eyes closed.
Even though we created this Philoid, we can't even save her.
We just create, and then we can't do anything else.
Humans are truly selfish creatures.
"Hey, Shiona..."
Tippy's eyelids slowly opened again. But the light had already vanished from her eyes. She probably couldn't see anymore.
"I'm here... I'm right here, Tippy-chan..."
Shiona's voice trembled slightly.
"That's good... Hey, Shiona."
"Yeah...?"
"Thank you for everything. You worked hard to keep Tippy from breaking, didn't you?"
"I think you know, but Tippy has been operating for over two hundred years since she started... but her original service life was only one hundred and fifty years. So, this isn't Shiona's or Rei's fault. It was bound to happen..."
When Tippy left the library and came to the church, Shiona apologized to Tippy, and Tippy forgave her.
That's what that meant...
"So, please. Shiona, don't cry... Sing... Sing a song..."
"Okay... Okay—!"
"Tippy... loves... Shiona's song."
Shiona began to sing a song. Sometimes she would sob, and the tune would go off-key. Even so, Shiona kept singing. To that melody—
"Thank... you..."
Tippy smiled—and then, she stopped moving.
My hand trembled.
Not just that.
My whole body was trembling.
Now, on my lap, another small life had come to an end.
Some might say it wasn't a life.
But for me, it was an irreplaceable life.
Shiona quietly continued to sing.
The tune wasn't off-key anymore. It was the same as always—or it should have been, but the song had a transparent resonance that went on forever.
It was a melody dedicated to Tippy.
Something hot flowed down my cheek.
It traced my jaw and fell onto Tippy's cheek.
Even though Tippy wasn't crying, she looked as if she were.
I held Tippy close.
That small body would never move again.
That mouth would never make a sound again.
Those hands would never draw again.
That was 'death'.
Warmth spread through my head.
Shiona was hugging me.
Suddenly, my eyes felt hot.
These are overflowing emotions. Unbearable pain, uncontrollable sadness... and immense sorrow.
For the first time in my life, I shed 'tears'.
Tears for Tippy—
After that, our lives changed drastically.
The e-book reader that Tippy entrusted to me, containing all the books from the library.
With what was once called a tablet, my knowledge increased rapidly.
How to grow crops, how to build houses with just stones and mud, how to predict the weather, countless animals and plants that can no longer be seen.
Furthermore, a database of newspapers spanning the past 350 years until the library ceased functioning.
I'm sure I could even look up myself if I searched.
"Rei, are you studying again today?"
"Yeah. There are tons of things I need to remember."
"What kind of book are you reading today?"
"Survival—methods to survive in any environment."
The power in the cold sleep facility wasn't very much. Therefore, we had to learn to manage with only a small amount of electricity.
We had already started securing drinking water using morning dew and night dew, and the problem of securing drinking water, which was the weakest point of this facility, was improving considerably.
Yes, from now on, we can't just rely on brute strength and physical power like before.
What we need from now on is knowledge. With knowledge, you can face multiple opponents alone, or even avoid confronting them in the first place—or even win.
We might even be able to help the people in the town.
I absorbed the "power" that Tippy left behind as if I were starving.
While I was reading, Shiona sang by the side of Tippy, who had stopped moving.
Among the luggage we brought from town was Shiona's brother's music box.
Occasionally, instead of singing, she would turn the handle and play the gentle melody of the music box.
It was a very calm and comforting time.
With my current "knowledge," it would probably be possible to live here with Shiona forever.
That's why... I didn't notice.
That there was something wrong with Shiona's body...
"Rei, dinner is ready."
Shiona, preparing the meal with a smile as always.
She had dissolved the oral block in water, making it like a soup.
It was very similar to the orange, fluffy soup Shiona always made for me in town.
"Thank you, this soup makes me feel energetic."
"Hearing you say that makes me happy too. My heart turns orange."
"But, Shiona, your soup is a small amount?"
The amount of soup in her bowl was less than half of mine.
"Because I'm a Philoid, this much is enough if I'm in save mode."
"Is that so?"
"Yeah. So you eat well, Rei. If you get hungry, you won't have energy, right?"
Ah... why didn't I notice?
At this time... her function as a Philoid had already deteriorated...
She was only operating at a sufficient level with half the amount of energy I was using.
As usual, I read a book, and Shiona sang a song.
Tracing the surface of the tablet with my fingertip, I pondered if there was a way to free the people in town.
Then, the rhythm of the comfortably flowing song suddenly stopped.
When I looked up, wondering if something was wrong, Shiona was frozen, covering her mouth.
The music box she was holding had also stopped.
"Shiona...? What's wrong?"
"Um... no, it's nothing. Just the song..."
She said that, and then took a deep breath.
And started singing again—
"...Huh? What was the pitch...?"
"Shio...na...?"
"Ahaha... isn't that strange? It was a song I loved so much, but wait a moment, I'll remember it right away..."
Shiona closed her eyes and tried to sing again from where she had stopped, many times.
But the melody that flowed from her mouth was completely different from the one I knew.
"What's wrong...? I can't remember my brother's song..."
"Shiona!? Is there something wrong with your body!?"
I was an idiot. In the end, I was only thinking about myself.
Shiona was kind to me, cherished me, and I was satisfied with that, spoiled... I wasn't thinking about her.
Even though she was caught in an explosion when we left town, losing the artificial skin on her arm.
"Shiona! Were you actually seriously injured during that explosion!?"
Shiona thought for a moment, then shook her head.
"That was okay, yeah."
Shiona—Philoids don't lie.
But they do hide words when thinking about humans.
Since she said she was okay, there probably wasn't any damage from being caught in the explosion.
Just as she said—"that" was okay.
"...Shiona. Will you let me see what's wrong with you?"
"...Okay."
Prompted by me, Shiona hesitated for a moment before nodding.
I almost looked away out of embarrassment at the suddenness of it, but what was there wouldn't let my gaze leave.
Shiona's white, firm chest.
There was a small hole in it.
"That is..."
Forgetting that she was a woman, I approached the wound.
This is a gunshot wound.
Immediately, I remembered the time at Mad's shop, when she shielded me from the humans.
"It... hit you..."
"I thought I was okay, but it seems I wasn't."
Shiona stuck out her tongue slightly and smiled, like a child caught doing something mischievous, but without showing any sign of being sorry.
I knew that was a smile meant to keep me from feeling guilty.
Even at a time like this, she's thinking about me.
"...! Search! MODA-117 Alice mk-17 Maintenance Manual!"
Responding to my voice, the tablet glowed faintly.
But Shiona covered the screen with her hand. And slowly shook her head.
Without letting her smile fade.
"It's my body. I know it best."
"But... there might be a way! If you had told me sooner...!"
—No, there was a reason she didn't tell me.
Shiona knew. She had suffered a fatal injury that couldn't be fixed.
No matter how much I struggled, that was an unchangeable reality.
It was something too awful to even put into words.
The word 'death' floated in my head.
No matter how much I didn't want to think about it, it just popped into my head.
"I know. I'm going to die soon. Since I'm a Philoid, should I say I'm going to 'break'?"
That's not right, Shiona.
You're not going to break.
You're going to die.
"Ahaha, I guess I'm a little out of it. I can't put any strength into my body..."
Just when I thought her shoulders had slumped, Shiona fell towards the floor.
"Shiona!"
I hurriedly caught her and held her in a position that would be as comfortable as possible.
How long had she been in this state?
Why didn't I notice...!
"Breaking... does that mean I won't be myself anymore...? But, can I be fixed...?"
"It's okay... Shiona is Shiona..."
"Ahaha... you know, right now... I'm a little scared..."
"Shiona... Shiona...!"
"Don't cry, Rey. Tipii-chan will laugh at you if you do."
Shiona's hand reached out to my cheek.
What she wiped away with her fingertip was my second tear.
"I don't want Rey to turn blue... I want you to always be orange and fluffy..."
I'm sad.
An immense sadness welled up inside me.
It multiplied infinitely in my heart, knowing no end.
As time passed, that sadness deepened.
Why am I sad?
The answer came immediately.
Because she's important.
She was an important existence to me.
Even if a Philoid with the same appearance appeared before me, it wouldn't mean anything.
It's okay if the appearance is different.
As long as the inside is you.
"Rey... you know, I thought of you as family. It's partly because you resembled my brother, but it's not just that. I thought of you as important."
Family.
That's an existence that believes and helps each other without any profit, unconditionally.
That is 'love'.
The emotion I had longed for at some point.
I had realized that emotion without even knowing it.
I had been given it... for so long.
It's an emotion that's so natural when living life, when walking with someone.
"What's wrong, Rey...? Don't make such a sad face... That's right, let's sing a song. Let's go to the plaza again... Everyone will be happy."
"...Shiona...?"
"It's a promise we made with everyone. Rey gave everyone smiles, made them feel happy."
That was a memory from when we were happy. A memory of the fun days we spent in town.
It was probably a confusion in her memory area.
But...
"...That's right, let's sing. Everyone is looking forward to it."
I turned the handle of the music box that was on the floor.
A melody began to flow quietly.
Shiona's cheeks relaxed, and she closed her eyes and began to sing.
I also closed my eyes, listened to the melody, and reminisced.
It wasn't a long time, but I recalled the scene of that town where I spent time.
People walking on the street stopped and turned to look.
One by one, they gathered in the plaza.
Children, the elderly, someone's mother, her husband, the people of the town began to smile.
As if intoxicated by the melody Shiona was singing.
I'm sure that scene was normal a long time ago.
Without distinction between Humans and Philoids, they smiled and spent time together, leaning on each other.
It was something normal that we had forgotten... that we had lost...
Hey, Rey... please, please keep smiling.
...Okay.
It's okay to be sad, it's okay to be angry... But... after that, smile.
Hey... if love had a shape, it would surely be round. Because love would never hurt anyone.
I held back my tears and smiled.
Hey... if love had a temperature, it would surely be warm. Because love warms you by embracing you.
Yeah... I'm sure it would.
Because there is love, Rey isn't sad. Because love is something that protects, and it won't hurt Rey. I promise you. No matter what happens from now on, our love will protect Rey.
I had shed so many tears that my eyes hurt.
My vision blurred.
But even through that, I could clearly see only Shiona's smile.
So don't cry. Love is always by your side. Because love is eternal. You don't have to cry. Because it's eternal.
I placed my hand over Shiona's hand that was on my cheek.
It was warm, but there was almost no strength left.
It was as if something was spilling out from the gaps in her hand.
I knew what was spilling out.
But I didn't want to admit it.
I squeezed her hand tightly, wishing that it wouldn't spill out.
I could hear the song.
The warm melody that Shiona always hummed.
It entered the gaps in my heart, which had begun to darken, and filled them with warmth.
I'm sorry, for making you lonely again.
--! That's not true. That's not true!
I wanted to tear at my own head.
Now, I finally realized.
Shiona wasn't afraid of breaking. She was afraid that I would be alone again.
I... received so much, so much from Shiona...!
Rey?
With my human hand, I held Shiona's mechanical hand.
That's right, until I met Shiona, I was an ambiguous existence, neither Human nor Philoid.
Shiona stayed by my side the whole time, and because of that-- I became Human.
Shiona will always be inside me, I'm not alone anymore. Joy, sadness, anger... I received all of it from you. I'll never forget it.
Ah... this is bad, I have to smile here.
I have to make Shiona feel at ease, but my emotions won't allow it...
No matter how hard I try, tears spill from the surging sadness.
So Shiona, don't make such a sad face. I'll be okay. Absolutely, I'll be okay.
I see... then, that's good.
Shiona nodded, looking satisfied.
Oh...
Shiona narrowed her eyes as if bewildered. Then, as if pushed out by her eyelids, transparent drops began to cover her eyes.
That's surely, different...
I said in a trembling voice, smiling to reassure Shiona.
Now that I've become Human, I understand the meaning of those tears.
Shiona seemed to realize it immediately as well, and smiled back at me.
Tears... they also flow when you're happy, don't they?
The strength slowly drained from Shiona's body.
Am I smiling? Me.
Was I able to smile so that Shiona wouldn't be anxious?
...See you again.
...Yeah, see you again.
And then, with a sigh,
Shiona closed her eyes.
In that instant, Shiona had perhaps the most beautiful face I had ever seen.
And then, Shiona never opened her eyes again.
That gentle face looks like she's smiling.
As if she's praying for my happiness.
But there's no happiness in a world without Shiona.
My life that continues from now on is hell itself.
Will I be able to bear it?
...No, I have to bear it.
My chest is squeezed so tightly it hurts.
All my emotions circulate throughout my body, creaking.
Is my heart really this fragile and weak?
Is losing someone important this painful and agonizing?
Ugh... Ah...!!
My vision was stained pure white, and as if to shatter that world, I cried out in lament.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...!
Shiona said.
Certainly, Shiona's love might be eternal.
But I couldn't bear it.
I know, this is emotion.
Something Shiona gave me.
This suffering, this sadness.
But that's not all.
The warmth that barely remains in my chest, and the memories with everyone that I can proudly say were fun.
All of that, too, was given to me by Shiona.
Both of them are mine now.
I won't let go of either of them.
How much time has passed?
How much time does a Human need to sort out their feelings?
I... kept remembering the time I met Shiona, over and over again.
The meals we ate together.
When we woke up in the morning and exchanged greetings.
We went shopping together.
I worried her when I went to the abandoned factory.
She was so happy when the music box was fixed.
We sang a song in the town square and were surrounded by smiles.
We made a promise...
I learned warmth.
I learned joy.
There were times I felt anger.
There were times I shed tears of sadness.
And... I received love.
--No... Everything was love.
This tragedy was caused by the foolishness of us Humans who lost that love.
Humans are hopelessly selfish.
We keep repeating the same things...
Even so, I would still need someone.
This is instinct. Even when I woke up here, I wanted to meet Humans.
It's the instinct to desire to walk alongside someone, the instinct to seek love.
I couldn't even realize something so simple...
I look at the cold sleep devices in front of me.
There were still a few left, ones that were functioning normally, and I had laid Shiona and Tippy in each of them.
Although they were originally for Humans, this would probably suppress the aging process a little.
I wanted to preserve their forms, even just a little.
Before the two of them, who looked like they were just sleeping, I murmured.
Shiona, Tippy... I'm going now.
There was no reply.
There shouldn't have been.
But I continued.
I'm going on a journey now. Don't worry, it's not a aimless journey. I'm going to find a world where Humans and Philoids can coexist.
That was also the wish that the Human youth who had been eliminated spoke of.
If there was a world where Humans and Philoids could coexist, this kind of sadness wouldn't happen.
If there was a world where Humans and Philoids could coexist, there would be no greater joy.
So, I'm going to go look for it now.
And if that world doesn't exist--
I clench my iron fist, covering it with my bare hand.
--No, it definitely exists. The world you tried to leave behind for us Humans definitely exists.
Finding it will be extremely difficult.
But I have the knowledge that Tippy gave me.
And I have the emotions that Shiona gave me.
In this world, I have partners who continue to convey "love" to me.
So, the journey from now on is not a journey of despair.
I'll borrow this. I'll come back to return it someday.
In my hand is Shiona's brother's music box.
I turn the handle in front of the sleeping Shiona, letting the melody of peace contained within resonate.
Following that melody, I felt as if I heard her singing.
Well then, I'm off.
A world where Humans and Philoids can join hands--.
I took that first step.
Even so, I remained hopeful and continued to reach both arms toward the light.
Did you wake up?
...Where... am I?
You have awakened from a long sleep. Do you know your name?
My name is...
Aso International Model, MODA-117 Alice mk-17. My individual name has not been set.
It seems the settings have been initialized after all. For a while, it's fine to just be Alice.
The man in front of me held out an old-fashioned wooden box to me.
What is this...?
It's something that was placed inside the device you were sleeping in.
I accepted the box. It felt very nostalgic.
When I opened the lid, there was a dull golden disc. When I turned the handle sticking out from the side of the box, a clear melody began to play.
A very beautiful melody flowing as the metal comb is gently plucked.
It's a song that has been played for a very long time.
A melody not in my records.
Even so, it felt very nostalgic, warm, and my chest felt warm and fuzzy.
And at the same time...
Something hot spilled from my eyes.
Emotional function runaway detected. Maintenance may be required.
No, that's not necessary. You should cherish those emotions. ...Only the knowledge was passed down, but it took quite some time to regain the technology to utilize it. I apologize.
The man spoke to me gently.
I felt a nostalgic resemblance in his expression as well.
Not in my records──...my memories...
Anyway, let's go home after we finish the basic maintenance.
Where to?
To town.
Outside the facility, it was dazzling.
The sky was blue and endlessly high. White clouds drifted slowly, drawing various shapes.
Warm air filled my artificial lungs. A gentle breeze softly stroked my hair.
It was a natural sight.
For some reason, I felt nostalgic for this ordinary world.
And... for some reason, I felt very sad.
We drove along the paved road in a car.
The scenery visible from the window was all beautiful.
Greenery was lush.
Small fish were jumping on the surface of a clear stream.
In the sky, small birds were flying harmoniously while chirping.
Alright, we're here.
Passing through the gate, we arrived at a town surrounded by white walls.
It was overflowing with many people.
Humans and Philoids were holding hands, living their ordinary lives.
My eyes grew hot again at that sight.
Excuse me, there is still a risk of emotional function runaway. My chest rhythm pattern is also not within normal values.
It's alright. I'm sure that's the right thing.
Is that so? In that case, am I a defective product?
No, you're normal. You are closer to a Human than any other Philoid.
Those words made me very happy as a Philoid.
But I didn't understand why he said that.
I gazed intently at the town that felt nostalgic.
In a corner of the plaza, Human children and child-type Philoids were playing happily.
That's a photo studio. A Philoid shopkeeper is smilingly taking pictures of a Human family.
At a general store a little distance away, Humans were shopping, and the Philoid shopkeeper was responding in an unfriendly manner.
Sensei, welcome back.
A very cute girl Philoid ran up to me.
Oh, I'm back. Were you a good girl, Dorothy?
Yes! While Sensei was gone, I drew lots of pictures. Look.
The little girl showed me the picture she had probably drawn, with a beaming smile.
The townspeople were in a circle, laughing.
The picture, drawn with crayons, was very warm, and just looking at it made my chest feel warm and fuzzy.
It was a picture that made everyone who saw it feel happy.
Huh? You are...
The girl looked up at me.
Nice to meet you. I'm Alice, please take care of me.
Ali...ce? Hello, Alice. Dorothy is Dorothy because she hasn't been individually registered.
Yes, I'm the same.
An unregistered Philoid. What should I do if I don't have a main partner?
Perhaps sensing my unease, the man next to me patted me on the shoulder.
What do you want to try?
...What can I do...?
Alice, can you sing a song?
Yes, a song. Like this.
Dorothy closed her eyes and began to sing.
It was a little clumsy, but it was a song I had heard before.
It's a song that's been sung for a very, very long time. There's no one in the world who doesn't know it.
The man said that and took out a music box from the car.
He opened the lid and turned the handle sticking out from the side of the box.
Clear sounds were played, and a gentle melody began to flow.
Drawn by the melody, the townspeople gathered.
Everyone listened to the sound and their expressions became gentle.
I know this scene.
My memory area, which should be pure white──a memory breathing faintly in a deeper part of it gently knocked on my chest.
My mouth moved naturally.
The song, which I should have been singing for the first time, felt familiar in my throat, on my lips... in my heart.
The melody of the music box filling the plaza was very nostalgic.
Wow, it's so pretty. You're good!
Yes, this song is... a very important song.
