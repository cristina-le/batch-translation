──The air shifted.
The pale blue light that had enveloped me until then receded.
What I saw next was a stained ceiling.
My right arm, extended towards that spot, was slightly different from my left arm, which was also extended.
From the wrist down, my right arm was made of exposed mechanical parts.
My fingers moved smoothly, but each time, a small metallic scraping sound echoed.
Next, I slowly raised my upper body.
That's when I realized the pale blue light I had been seeing was the oval-shaped lid of a gentle curve.
It seems I had been sleeping inside this capsule-like object.
Where is this place?
Who am I?
Why am I here?
I asked myself, but found no answers.
Even when I tried to recall my memories, all I had was the memory of the pale blue light.
In search of a clue to my memory, I got out of the capsule and decided to wander around the room.
Although I knew the act of walking, it seemed I hadn't done it in a long time, as my steps were unsteady.
I walked slowly, being careful not to fall.
The air was lukewarm, and dust clung to my throat every time I inhaled it into my lungs.
Light streamed in through a hole in the ceiling, and along those rays, the dust in the air was revealed.
It's likely that no one has entered this building for a long time.
Thin dust covered the floor.
What kind of place is this?
Numerous oval capsules were scattered throughout the large room.
Most of them were open.
They were empty.
Even if some were closed, there was nothing inside.
It seems I am the only one in this room.
──No, to be precise, that's not true.
There were people leaning against the oval objects or lying on the floor.
But, no.
To be precise, those weren't people.
It would be more accurate to call them humanoid objects.
Those humanoid objects had mechanical parts peeking out from under their skin.
Some had mechanical parts from the neck up.
Some had exposed mechanical arms.
Some had their lower bodies torn off, revealing mechanical parts.
That's when I remembered what those humanoid objects were.
Partners for Humans, created for Humans.
They were the beings closest to Humans, equipped with not only the five senses but also emotions.
I reached out my hand to the Philoid that had stopped functioning.
The hand, with its exposed parts not covered by skin, was remarkably similar to my right hand.
This is a factory.
I was made here.
...However, the facility was likely abandoned for some reason just before completion.
Staring at my mechanical right hand, before it was covered with artificial skin, I concluded the most likely possibility.
Understanding my own existence, I began walking towards the wall.
There was an old automatic door there, and right next to it, an LCD panel displaying "CLOSE" was covered in dust.
I touched it with my mechanical hand.
The moment I felt something cold, like electricity, on my bloodless fingertips, it displayed "OPEN" and the door opened.
Could I get outside from here?
Is there anyone left in this facility?
I wanted to meet someone.
I wanted to meet a Human.
Let's go find them, my partner.
I pushed open the door leading outside.
To prove my own existence.
When I returned home, I headed straight for the living room.
There was the broken music box.
I opened the book I borrowed from the library and studied its structure.
Just as I thought, one of the gears inside was chipped.
That's why no matter how much I turned the handle, the disk wouldn't spin and no sound would play.
...But what should I do about this gear?
Would it be possible to make one to the exact size described in the book? No, it's impossible.
Without finding an answer, I continued through the pages of the book.
At the end of the book was a list of products by manufacturer and a list of parts used.
As I skimmed through it, my gaze was caught by something.
What I learned there was that the manufacturer who made this music box also made clocks.
If that's the case, they might have used the same parts for the intricate components as they did for clocks.
Suddenly, I remembered the clock I broke at Mr. Mad's shop.
That clock... if he's going to throw it away because it's unusable...
Perhaps I could fix the music box by using parts like gears from inside the clock.
"Ray, what are you doing?"
Just as the possibility of repair became clear, Shiona entered the living room.
"Shiona, listen. I might be able to fix the music box with parts from the clock at Mr. Mad's shop."
"Really? Is that true?"
Shiona had an even happier smile than usual.
From her expression, I could tell how happy Shiona was.
"But please don't push yourself. Even without the music box, I can still sing."
Shiona picked up the music box and started to sing.
That song she sang in the chapel.
That song that felt somehow nostalgic.
That song that warmed the depths of my chest.
Looking at Shiona gazing lovingly at the music box, my resolve grew stronger.
I want to fix this music box for her.
And I want to make Shiona happy.
That feeling swelled within me.
"Tomorrow, I'll go to Mr. Mad's shop again."
I'll try to ask if he'll let me have the clock somehow.
But there was one thing that worried me.
That was the fact that I had broken the clock.
Although I apologized, it still felt difficult to go there.
Thinking about being yelled at by Mr. Mad again made me feel scared.
"You know, I want to make lots of people smile with this song, Big Brother."
Shiona's words reached me as I hesitated.
"This song is orange... and I'm sure it can make many people's hearts orange. Because it's a song that was created with the wish that it would become like that. Because that's Big Brother's wish. That's why, you see, I want many people to hear this song. And I want to make many people smile. That's my wish."
Shiona said, as if talking to herself.
Those words gave me a push.
I'll go to Mr. Mad's shop again tomorrow.
And I'll apologize again for breaking the clock.
With Shiona's singing voice and the music box, I solidified my resolve.
The next day, I visited Mr. Mad's shop alone.
I can't count how many times I thought about turning back on the way.
Every time I thought that, Shiona's smile came to mind.
I want to see that smile forever.
That's why I want to fix the music box for her.
I recalled my resolve from yesterday many times.
What I can do for Shiona.
I steeled myself and stepped into Mr. Mad's shop.
"What nerve you have, showing your face here."
Immediately after, Mr. Mad's low voice, like distant thunder, rained down on me.
I wanted to run away right away, but I didn't.
"I wanted to apologize more properly for yesterday."
"About the clock? You already apologized for that."
"Shiona was there at that time... I wanted to apologize properly, by myself."
"I don't need that. Just go home."
"I can't do that. I'm truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday."
"No matter how much you apologize, the clock is still broken. Go home."
"I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry."
With my head bowed, I continued to apologize.
How much time had passed?
Eventually, Mr. Mad's voice, slightly softer, reached me.
"...Look up."
When I did as I was told, Mr. Mad's face, looking somewhat exasperated, was there.
"Good grief... What a guy. You're incredibly persistent."
"I'm sorry..."
"Stop apologizing, or I'll knock you out!"
He said that, but there didn't seem to be as much anger as yesterday.
I thought I heard the sound of a small sigh.
"You're done with what you needed, right? Go home already."
"Um... I have just one favor to ask."
"A favor? You have some nerve asking me for a favor."
My legs trembled under the pressure, but Shiona's words pushed me forward.
"That clock... would you let me have it?"
"...Say that again."
"Um... the clock from yesterday, would you let me--"
"DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!"
Struck by a shock like a direct hit from lightning, I froze, standing perfectly still.
"You broke it yourself and now you want me to give it to you? Don't get carried away!"
It's no use...
Not anymore...
As I was about to run away, a voice came from behind me.
"Please wait, Mr. Mad. Ray just wants to fix my brother's music box."
There was Shiona, who was supposed to be waiting at home.
Shiona stepped between me and Mr. Mad, unafraid of him.
"My brother's music box is broken, and Ray said he'd fix it for me. He just needs the parts for that. He's truly reflecting on breaking the clock yesterday, too. So, could you please forgive him?"
Shiona conveyed this to Mr. Mad without losing her smile.
"Hmm... Hmmm..."
Mr. Mad, who had been bright red, his expression gradually softened.
"But you know, that clock isn't here anymore. I threw that thing away. However..."
Mr. Mad turned his back to us, but continued to speak.
I threw it away at the abandoned factory on the outskirts of town. I don't know what happened after that."
Saying only that, Mr. Mad sat down facing the wall.
"Thank you, Mr. Mad."
Shiona bowed without losing her smile and left the shop.
"Ah, thank you..."
I bowed in the same way and left the shop.
"The abandoned factory is very close to where you collapsed, Ray."
As soon as we left the shop, Shiona told me.
"Um, is that where Shiona goes to throw away trash?"
"That's right. Trash from various places gathers there."
"Could it be that he fixes things he picks up from there and sells them here?"
"Yes. Mr. Mad often goes to that place."
I see, that's why there were so many old things in the shop.
He probably brings things that look usable from that place and reuses them.
Anyway, I decided to head to that abandoned factory.
"Shiona, if it's okay, I'd like you to guide me to that place."
"I'm sorry, the red children are coming to my house today."
She was probably talking about the children Shiona was talking to yesterday.
Come to think of it, she had promised to treat them to soup.
"But Ray, you can't go alone, can you? I'll break my promise with the children."
"No, it's okay, Shiona. Keep your promise."
"But how will you get there?"
"I'll try going to the library. I want to know about this area and look at a map."
"The library..."
Shiona's expression seemed to cloud over slightly.
"Huh... No, it's nothing. ...Hey, Ray. Is Tippy attached to you?"
"I wonder. I don't think she dislikes me, but why?"
"No, it's nothing. There's definitely a map at the library. Have a good trip."
"Okay, I will. Well then, see you later."
I turned on my heel and started to head towards the library.
At that moment, Shiona's smile seemed to me to hold a hint of sadness.
But I didn't know the reason why.
"Ray, you came."
Tippy was in the same place as yesterday, crying the same way.
"Yeah, I came. Hey Tippy, can I ask you something?"
"Is there a map of the town in this library?"
"Yes, there is. There are many."
"That's good. Will you show me where the map is?"
"Okay, but... but..."
Tippy was somewhat hesitant.
"No, that's not it... That's not it, but..."
"Will you hold me?"
Tippy's face turned slightly red.
Her sad expression hadn't changed, but her cheeks seemed to soften just a little.
"...Hold you? Hold you, like yesterday?"
"Yeah... Is it no good?"
"It's not no good. Here, come here."
"Okay... Okay..."
When I opened my arms, Tippy stood up and, with some hesitation, jumped into my chest.
Unlike yesterday, I was holding her.
But I felt the same way.
Tippy, whom I held, was still small, soft, and seemed like she might break.
"Tippy, is this okay?"
"Yeah, it's good. Ray... you're warm."
Tippy rubbed her cheek against my chest.
That gesture warmed the depths of my heart.
Could this be the feeling of endearment?
I want to protect this girl.
I want to stop these tears.
I held Tippy for a while.
"Um, walk that way like this."
Tippy pointed her finger down the aisle from within my embrace.
Still holding her, I headed in the direction she indicated with her fingertip.
"Why do you need a map?"
"There seems to be an abandoned factory near town. I want to go there."
"Why to the abandoned factory?"
"There might be a part I'm looking for there."
"For the music box you were looking at yesterday?"
"Yeah, that's right. I really want to fix Shiona's brother's music box for her."
"Shiona's... I see. I hope you find it."
While being held by me, Tippy led me without hesitation to the bookshelf where the map books were kept.
"Could it be that you remember where each book is?"
"Yeah, mostly."
"That's amazing... Did someone teach you?"
"No. While I was waiting for my dad and mom, I did it by myself."
When she mentioned her dad and mom, Tippy's eyes became a little teary.
"Um... maybe this one."
To change the subject, I took out a map book.
I sat down there and opened the book.
Like the music box book, this map was also handwritten.
Could it be that all the books in this library are handwritten?
If so, that's a considerable amount.
Who on earth handwritten this much volume of books?
The work, which must have taken an endless amount of time, makes me feel faint.
"It's pretty worn out... How old is this book?"
"Um... I don't know. It's a book from a long, long, long time ago."
It seemed like a map from decades ago.
The buildings themselves looked the same as the current townscape, but...
The pages were badly faded, as if tea had been spilled on them.
Some were stuck together and seemed like they would tear if I turned them.
I carefully turned the pages.
"Ah, maybe it's this one?"
I found the map symbol for a factory in the northern part of town.
Considering the direction of Shiona's house, it's highly likely this is the place.
"Ray... are you leaving? Don't go..."
Tippy clung to my neck.
I stroked her small back with my hand many times.
"It's okay, I'll come again."
"Really? Will you really come again?"
"Yeah, of course. I promise."
"Absolutely? You'll absolutely, absolutely come again, right?"
"Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely."
Again and again, I exchanged promises with Tippy.
Why was it?
Even so, I felt reluctant to leave the place.
A feeling of wanting to stay by Tippy's side forever was welling up inside me.
Hiding that feeling, I left the library.
Entering the abandoned factory I reached by relying on the map, the smell of oxidized oil stung my nose.
This factory must have originally made the arms and legs of Philoids.
Around me, parts of unfinished Philoid arms and legs were scattered everywhere.
All of them were before the artificial skin was applied, with the mechanical parts exposed.
Looking closely, I could see that they were made the same way as my right hand.
Even though I knew they were manufactured, this sight was strange.
To move the arm that was lying there, I pushed it away with my right hand.
A mournful sound of metal hitting metal echoed through the factory.
If some part of my body breaks by chance, I'll come here.
Here, there are mountains of replacement parts.
In the back, several drums filled with oxidized oil were lying around.
Most of it was oxidized, but there was also some unopened oil.
Even if I run out of oil, I could perform maintenance here without being seen.
The further I went into the factory, the more the worries I had in the back of my mind were resolved.
This abandoned factory should become an important place for me.
But I can't find the essential thing.
That is, of course, the clock that Mad-san said he threw away here.
But inside this factory, there is nothing that looks like trash, let alone a clock.
Perhaps the trash wasn't thrown away inside the factory, but outside?
I left the factory for a moment and decided to walk around its perimeter.
Then, behind the factory, I found an area where mechanical parts were piled high.
Of course, there were mechanical parts, but also a lot of trash was thrown away.
Surely this is the town's garbage dump.
Besides Mad-san, there must be others who take things from here that they can use.
Looking up at that mountain, which was many times my height, I thought such things.
"...Well, where could it be?"
There's a considerable amount of trash.
It's going to be a pain to find it by searching diligently.
But there's no other way.
I immediately decided to start searching from my feet.
I don't know how much time passed.
My sense of time was long gone.
Because I had been moving muddy metal plates and containers covered in waste oil, my hands were completely dirty.
Oil was stuck all over my clothes, and somehow, a lot of stains had appeared.
After that, I crossed the carpet of trash, swam in the river of filth, and was beaten by the waterfall of scrap.
And finally, I found it.
It was the one from Mad-san's shop.
The one I broke yesterday.
That clock.
I picked it up and stared at the hands on the face.
Naturally, it wasn't moving.
I put my ear to the main body, but it made no sound.
It was natural, since I had broken it.
This clock will likely never tick again.
That fact pricked a little at the back of my chest.
I gently hugged the clock and decided to head home.
Shiona welcomed me back gently.
"I'm home. I found it."
When I held out my oil-stained trophy, Shiona smiled softly.
"It's true, thank you. Here, change your clothes, change your clothes."
Shiona had prepared a towel and a change of clothes for me.
After wiping off the dirt and changing, I headed to the living room.
There, Shiona welcomed me again.
"Ray, you must be tired, right? Eat and rest."
"No, I'm fine. I want to start working right away."
"Are you sure? I'm worried about your body, Ray."
"I'm okay. Strangely, I don't feel tired right now."
"But you have to eat..."
"Yeah, I know. I'll eat later, so you go ahead and eat."
"...Okay, I understand. Good luck."
Shiona left the living room.
Seeing her off, I started working.
I opened the book I borrowed from the library beside me.
This music box works by turning the handle, which causes gears of various sizes inside to intricately mesh together, making the disk rotate at a constant speed.
It seems that turning it faster doesn't necessarily make the song play faster.
I thought that was a really amazing technology.
Following the assembly instructions written in the book in reverse order, I disassembled the music box.
And as I checked the presence or absence of the parts in order, I found that a gear in the power transmission part was cracked.
Is it true that for something that moves precisely, just one small part breaking can make it stop working?
I couldn't help but look at my right hand.
For now, let's find a gear of the same size as this cracked one from the clock.
Next, I started disassembling the clock.
I removed the lid and used a screwdriver to remove the screws.
When I removed the cover, the internal structure was revealed.
Gears much more precise than those in the music box were meshing together in layers.
One of them, the shaft part of a slightly larger gear, was broken. Because of that, the part wasn't rotating.
This must be the place I broke yesterday.
The fact that Mad-san threw away this clock means he didn't have a gear of the same size as this one.
What was fortunate was that the broken gear wasn't the size needed for the music box.
Disassembling things feels somewhat reluctant.
Because I'm breaking this clock to fix the music box.
Is it because I understand what kind of existence I am?
Hesitating, but as a small offering, I disassembled the clock as carefully as possible.
I lined up the clock's gears on the table, from the smallest ones in order, and compared them to the music box's.
"...Found it."
I was able to find a gear that seemed to be almost the same size.
Now, all I have to do is transplant this into the music box according to the book.
"I think this should be okay..."
With this, the disk should move without any problems.
I put the lid back on and turned the handle, and felt resistance.
But the handle wouldn't turn any further.
Why?
I reread the book.
The parts and their positions are fine.
Tilting my head, I removed the lid again.
And then, I tried turning the handle as is.
The gears were indeed meshing perfectly.
However, it seems the oil has completely dried up from not being used for a while.
That must be why the handle won't turn.
What should I do?
Should I go to Shiona and borrow some cooking oil?
...No, that's also a problem.
Cooking oil and gear lubricant are probably different types.
It might work at first, but it could cause a malfunction later.
Then, what should I do...?
Suddenly, I looked at my right hand.
Although covered by a glove, there are exposed mechanical parts underneath.
How about using the oil used in my hand?
I took off my glove and looked closely at my right hand.
Exposed mechanical parts.
Oil is built into the interior to make these parts move smoothly.
I inserted a screwdriver into the palm near the base of my thumb.
When I removed the exterior, it was packed with mechanisms for moving the mechanical hand, such as wiring, cylinders, and shafts.
Oil was contained in one of those cylinders.
And it was detachable so that old oil could be easily replaced.
I removed the cylinder with my left hand and dripped the oil that filled it onto the music box gears.
I spread the oil with my fingertips so that it would blend into all the gears as much as possible.
Will it work?
I put the cylinder back into my right hand and reattached the exterior.
Hiding my mechanical arm with the glove, I cautiously tried turning the handle.
At first, it was stiff. But as I turned the handle, the gears ran smoothly.
The oil must have circulated through all the gaps between the gears, as the handle continued to turn without any resistance.
And then, that melody began to play.
"Ray, that song...!"
Shiona suddenly entered the room.
"Yeah. It's fixed, Shiona."
"Thank you... Thank you, Ray. Thank you... I'm so, so happy."
Shiona showed me a smile I had never seen before.
Just seeing that smile made the back of my chest feel warm and fuzzy.
And then, I realized.
Ah, this is it.
This is the feeling of happiness.
I am happy now.
Seeing Shiona's smile, I am happy.
And for the first time, I felt a sense of being useful.
"Thank you, Ray, thank you."
Shiona took my hand and thanked me repeatedly.
As her face drew closer, I felt my face grow hot.
"Thanks to your hard work, Ray, the music box is fixed. I can hear that song again, the one I had given up on. This orange song that my brother made. This song that I love so much..."
"Hey, Shiona, sing it. Let me hear your brother's song."
"Yes... of course!"
I turned the handle of the music box.
Shiona clasped her hands in front of her chest and began to sing along with the melody.
The song she sang when we first met.
The song Shiona's brother made.
The orange song.
Now, I felt like I understood what that meant.
The emotion residing in my chest is joy.
Shiona's song.
And Shiona singing so happily.
Just watching her, joy overflowed within me.
More than ever, Shiona sang that song with such happiness.
That day, Shiona kept singing until she fell asleep.
I also listened intently to her singing voice and the melody.
Again and again, Shiona asked me to play the song.
Shiona kept singing until my arm could no longer move.
Looking at her expression, I thought.
I want to stay with Shiona like this forever.
If Shiona wishes for it, I can stay with her forever.
But for that, my true identity must never be revealed.
Never, absolutely never...
That day, I solidified my resolve to stay with Shiona forever.
At night, in the darkened room.
On the two beds side by side, Shiona spoke to me.
"Will you grant my wish?"
"You see, I want many people to hear this song. And I want to make them smile. I want to make many people happy with this song my brother made."
I only knew the word.
But I didn't understand what it was.
Is it a state?
Or is it an emotion?
I repeated the word 'happiness' over and over in my head.
"And, I want you to help me."
"Help? How should I do that?"
"Tomorrow, I want you to come with me to the plaza. And I want you to turn the music box."
"And then, Shiona will sing, right?"
"Yes, that's right. And I want as many people as possible to hear it. That orange song my brother made..."
"Yeah, I want to do that too. Of course, I'll help."
I heard the sound of the sheets rustling.
"What's wrong, Shiona?"
"Hey, Ray... can we hold hands?"
I couldn't see Shiona's expression in the darkness.
But I felt like Shiona's face was red.
"Hands? With me?"
"Yeah, I want to hold hands with Ray... Is that... not okay...?"
I searched through my knowledge base.
I know the act of holding hands.
But what does it mean for a boy and girl of this age...
"No, it's okay..."
If a human... if Shiona asks for it, I want to respond.
Fortunately, she is on my left side.
I think it will be fine with the hand covered by artificial skin.
I reached my hand out to the adjacent bed.
In the cold room, the hand I extended felt a little chilly.
I searched for Shiona's hand in the air.
A touch, warmth.
Shiona's hand rested on mine.
"You're warm, Ray."
"Yeah... you're warm, Shiona."
We held hands.
Without either of us initiating, our fingers intertwined.
A warmth spread, not just from the heat emanating from our hands.
Is this the warmth of a human, different from my artificial warmth...?
"Ray... tighter."
"...Like this...?"
"Sorry, did that hurt?"
"No... it was just stronger than I expected."
"Is this tightness okay?"
"Yeah... thank you, Ray."
We held hands all night.
Our hands remained clasped until morning woke us up.
The next day, the plaza was filled with sound.
The melody that Shiona and I began to play.
Shiona sang.
And I turned the handle of Shiona's brother's music box.
At first, there were no people passing by.
But as if drawn by Shiona's singing voice, their numbers increased.
One person, then two, stopped, and soon a small circle formed.
That circle quickly grew larger, and the deserted plaza instantly became bustling with activity.
Everyone present was listening intently to Shiona's singing voice.
A young couple leaned close and held each other's hands.
An elderly person closed their eyes with deep emotion.
A young man gazed at a woman a little distance away.
A young parent and child laughed happily together.
Children moved their bodies in time with the song.
Each person listened to Shiona's song with their own thoughts.
But there was one thing they all had in common.
That was that everyone was 'smiling'.
Everyone listening to Shiona's song had a smile on their face.
Feeling that I was now helping to make the people here smile, I felt a warmth deep in my chest.
This is the feeling of happiness.
The emotion I felt yesterday when I saw Shiona's smile.
This is what it was.
I am happy.
I felt my cheeks lift slightly.
Surely, I was smiling too.
It might look a little awkward.
But that's okay.
If I could get even a little closer to Shiona, I was satisfied with just that.
The music box, which I had just repaired, continued to play the melody without a hitch.
The handle turned smoothly.
The sound flowing from the disc resonated inside the wooden box, amplified and coming out as a clear tone.
According to Shiona, it was the orange melody.
Shiona sang along to that melody.
