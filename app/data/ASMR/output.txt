High-piled clouds and a bright blue sky. The cicadas buzz loudly.
Someone is splashing around noisily by the riverbank.
Hey, what are you doing?
Your clothes are covered in mud.
If you get that dirty, your mom will be mad at you.
Heyyy.
Hey, I'm talking to youuu.
...Do you want to get scolded on purpose?
A few seconds pass.
Weirdo...
Oh, are you lonely? I see, I see~
Even if you're born into a rich family,
that kind of thing doesn't change, huh.
Hmph...
Too bad.
Even if you do something like that,
you won't get any attention anymore.
Starting today, I'm going to
take care of you... until you come of age?
I've been assigned to look after you.
So even if you get covered in mud, or get scrapes,
you can't get your family's attention like you used to, huh.
Ugh, don't make that face.
I'm sorry, okay?
Please don't cry.
Hmm...
Hup!
Sound of jumping in.
Eeeeyaaah! It's cooold!
Whoa!
Ugh...
It's muddy... I can't stand up very well.
Huh? What is it?
...Is it that weird?
Hmph...
Seeing you do it, it looked kind of nice,
so I tried it.
Aren't you lonely anymore?
Here, give me your hand...
I can't get up by myself.
You're a boy, so pull properly.
Hmph.
Okay... ready, set, go!
Ah!
The two of them lose their balance, sound of splashing water.
Pwah... ptooey, ugh!
Haaaah...
This is the worst.
I got mud on my face, and it got in my mouth too.
Huh? What are you laughing at?
Sound of splashing water.
Don't laugh!
You, you... hmph!
Don't laugh!
Heh... heheheh.
I guess I can't support you when you're five years younger than me after all.
Can't be helped, can't be helped, can't be helped.
Yeah, that's right.
You're in third grade, right? I'm in eighth.
Nice to meet you.
Fade to black.
Footsteps. Sound of the house door opening.
Helloooo!
...Oh, from now on, I guess it's 'I'm home'.
The inside is as spacious as ever.
I'm going to take a shower for now.
Since I'm covered in mud.
Shower, shower!
Show me to the bathroom.
Ugh, there are footprints on the floor.
I have to wipe them up later.
Hmph...
Oh, here it is.
Sound of the bathroom door opening.
Alright, I'm going to take all your clothes off now!
Your big sister will wash them for you.
I'll quickly take mine off too...
Hmph...
Shh, mmm... that's right.
Oh, the muddy clothes... I'm the one washing them, aren't I?
Haaah...
I wonder if it's okay to put these in the washing machine...
I should probably hand-wash them a little first, huh.
Huh? What are you looking at, you little rascal~?
Hurry up and get in the bath~
Here, go, go.
Sound of the bathroom door opening, the two of them enter and close it.
Whoa.
The bathroom's spacious too.
I pick up the shower head.
Hmm... that's right.
Sound of fine water flowing from the shower head.
I wait while checking the temperature with my hand until the shower gets warm.
Hmph...
Okay.
Is it okay if I pour it over your head? You can close your eyes and bear it, right?
Sounds good.
Okay. Close your eyes then~
Here I go~
Sound of the shower pouring over my head.
Hey, you gotta close your eyes properly, or it'll sting~
Why are you looking at me so much?
Here, here.
Sound of the shower stopping.
Alright, I guess that's about right.
I'm going to shampoo your hair next, okay?
Stay still.
Hmph...
Sound of head being scrubbed.
How is it? Does it feel good?
Good, good.
It's easy when your hair is short, huh.
Maybe I should cut mine a little shorter too...
...I'm not sure.
Hey, since you're rich,
Do you have a hairdresser come to your house to cut your hair?
Ah, I guess you'd go to a salon, huh?
Like a regular place your family has gone to for generations?
Hee, that sounds amazing.
Introduce me sometime, okay?
Hehe.
I'm going to rinse it out now.
Sound of the shower pouring over my head.
Keep your eyes closed~
Not yet~
Not yeeet~
Sound of the shower stopping.
Okay.
You can open your eyes now.
I'm going to wash your body next.
Turn this way.
That's right.
Ah.
Hey, it's hard to wash you when you stick to me.
Hmph... geez.
Huh? Boobs?
I have them... I have them, okay?
What, are you comparing me to your mom?
Of course they're smaller compared to an adult.
I'm still in middle school, you know.
You shouldn't say stuff like that to girls, you know.
The girls in your class will hate you.
Yeah, they'd hate me.
That's why I don't say it.
Haa... is this what it's like to have a little brother?
Here, raise your hands up.
Banzai.
Hmm... good.
Hmph...
Is it a little ticklish?
But if I don't scrub, the dirt won't come off.
I'll bear it.
Okay, now the other side.
I'll bear it.
You gotta bear it, okay~?
Next is from your neck to your stomach...
Ah, do you want to do the front yourself?
Why, you ask...?
Here, because it's a delicate... area.
Anyway, let's practice doing it yourself.
I'll wash your back for you.
Turn around.
Okay, okay... I'll wash you quickly.
Haaah...
Well, I guess you'll get used to it.
For now, I'll help you with your baths starting today, but
You have to learn to bathe yourself.
Why, you ask...?
You're dead wrong if you think a maid will do everything for you.
You have to do the bare minimum yourself.
All I'm doing is helping you with your personal care.
If it's too difficult, then for now,
At least be able to bathe and use the toilet by yourself.
You can use the toilet, right? Then all that's left is the bath.
You need to grow up to be a respectable person,
Or your mom and dad will be disappointed.
Okay?
Alright, good.
I'm going to become a proper maid too,
So I can be a fully fledged one.
You... no, Master?
But you're too young for the -sama suffix to feel right.
Hmm... 'Master' is probably easier to say, somehow.
Well, I think we'll be together for a long time, so
Let's both do our best, okay?
Right, Master?
