High-piled clouds and a bright blue sky. The cicadas sing.
Splish, splash, making noise by the riverbank.
Hey, what are you doing?
Your clothes are all muddy.
If you get that dirty, your mom's gonna be mad.
Hey~
Hey, I'm talking to you~
...Do you want to get scolded on purpose?
A few seconds pass.
Weirdo...
Ah, you're lonely? I see, I see~
Even if you're born into a rich family,
that kind of thing doesn't change, huh.
Hmph...
Too bad, though.
Even if you do that,
you won't get any attention anymore.
Starting today,
I'm going to take care of you until
you become an adult...?
So even if you get covered in mud, or get scrapes,
you can't get your family's attention like you used to, huh?
Ugh, don't make that face.
I said I'm sorry.
Please don't cry.
Hmm...
Eeeeyah!
Sound of jumping in
Eeeeyaaah! So cold!
Ugh...
Mmmph...
It's muddy... I can't, stand up very well...
Huh? What?
...Is it that weird?
Hmph...
Watching you do it, it looked kinda nice, so
I tried it.
Aren't you lonely anymore?
Here, give me your hand...
I can't get up by myself.
You're a boy, so pull properly.
Mmph.
Alright... ready, set, go!
Ah!
Sound of both losing balance and splashing water
Pahaha... ptoo, ugh ptoo.
Haaah...
This is the worst.
I got mud on my face, and it got in my mouth too.
Huh? What are you laughing at?
Sound of splashing water
Don't laugh!
You, you... mmmph!
Don't laugh!
Heh... heheheh...
I guess I can't support you when you're five years older than me after all.
Can't be helped, can't be helped, can't be helped.
Yeah, that's right.
You're in third grade, right? I'm in eighth.
Nice to meet you.
Fade to black.
Footsteps. Sound of opening the house door.
Excuse me! (Entering)
...Ah, from now on, I should say 'I'm home,' huh?
The inside is as spacious as ever.
I'm going to take a shower for now.
I'm covered in mud, after all.
Shower, shower!
Show me to the bathroom.
Ugh, there are footprints on the floor.
I have to wipe that up later.
Hmph...
Ah, here it is.
Sound of opening the bathroom door.
Alright, I'm going to take all my clothes off!
Your big sis will wash them for you.
I'll quickly take mine off too...
Mmph...
Shh, mmmph... there.
Ah, muddy clothes... I'm the one washing them, aren't I?
Haa...
I wonder if it's okay to put these in the washing machine...
I should probably hand-wash them a little first, huh?
Hm? What are you looking at, huh?
Hurry up and get in the bath~
Come on, go, go!
Sound of opening the bathroom door, the two of them enter and close it.
Ooh~
The bathroom is spacious too.
Picks up the shower head.
Mmph... there.
Sound of fine water flowing from the shower head.
Waiting while checking the temperature with her hand until the shower warms up.
Hmph...
Alright.
Is it okay if I pour it over your head? You can close your eyes and bear it, right?
Nice~
Okay. Close your eyes then~
Here I go~
Sound of showering from the head.
Hey, you gotta close your eyes tight, or it'll sting~
Why are you looking at me so much?
Come on, come on~
Sound of shower stopping.
Alright, is this good enough?
Next, I'm gonna shampoo your hair, okay?
Stay still now~
Hmph...
Sound of scrubbing head.
How is it? Does it feel good?
Good, good~
It's so easy when your hair is short, huh?
Maybe I should cut mine a little shorter too~
...I'm not sure.
Hey, do rich people...
Have hairdressers come to their house to cut their hair?
Ah, I guess they go to a salon, huh?
Like a family salon that's been around for generations?
Hee, that sounds amazing~
Introduce me sometime, okay?
Hmph hmph~
Alright, I'm gonna rinse you off now~
Sound of shower water pouring over head.
Keep your eyes closed, okay~?
Not yet~
Not yeeet~
Sound of shower stopping.
Okay!
You can open your eyes now, all good~
Next, I'm gonna wash your body, so
Turn this way~
That's it, that's it~
Ah!
Hey, it's hard to wash you when you're clinging to me!
Ugh... geez~
Huh? Boobs?
I have some... I mean, I do have them, but
What, are you comparing them to your mom's?
Of course they're smaller than an adult's, duh~
I'm still in middle school, y'know!
You shouldn't say stuff like that to girls, you know.
The girls in your class will hate you.
Yeah, they will hate me.
That's why I don't say it.
Haa... is this what it's like to have a little brother?
Alright, raise your hands up!
Banzai~
Mmm... okay.
Hmph...
Does it tickle a little?
But I have to scrub hard to get you clean.
Just bear with it.
Okay, now turn around.
Bear with it.
You gotta bear with it, okay~?
Next is from your neck to your tummy...
Oh, do you want to do the front yourself?
Why, you ask...?
Well, because it's a delicate... area.
Anyway, let's practice doing it yourself.
I'll do your back for you.
Turn around.
Okay, okay... I'll wash you quickly.
Haaah...
Well, I guess you'll get used to it.
Just so you know, I'll be helping you with your baths from today, but...
You need to learn to bathe yourself.
Why, you ask...?
You're dead wrong if you think a maid will do everything for you.
You have to do the bare minimum yourself.
All I'm doing is helping you with your personal needs.
If it's too difficult, then for now...
Make sure you can at least bathe and use the toilet by yourself.
You can use the toilet, right? Then all that's left is the bath.
You need to grow up to be a respectable person, or...
Your mom and dad will be disappointed.
Okay?
Alright, got it.
I'm going to become a proper maid from now on too.
So we both need to become fully capable.
You... no, Master? But you're too young for me to properly use "-sama" with your name.
Hmm... "Master" is probably easier to say.
Well, I think we'll be together for a long time, so...
Let's both do our best, okay?
Right, Master?
As the shower is turned on, I gradually fade out.
