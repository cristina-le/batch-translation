──The air shifted.
The pale blue light that had been enveloping me receded.
What I eventually saw was a grimy ceiling.
My right arm, extended towards that spot, was slightly different from my left arm, which was also extended.
My right arm was made of exposed mechanical parts from the wrist down.
My fingers moved smoothly, but with each movement, a faint scraping of metal echoed.
Next, I slowly raised my upper body.
That's when I realized that the pale blue light I had been seeing was coming from an oval-shaped lid with a gentle curve.
It seems I had been asleep inside this capsule-like thing.
Where is this place?
Who am I?
Why am I here?
Even when I ask myself these questions, I can't find the answers.
Even when I try to recall my memories, all I have is the memory of the pale blue light.
To find a clue to my memories, I decided to get out of the capsule and wander around the room.
Although I know the act of walking, it feels like it's been a long time since I've done it, and my footing is unsteady.
I paid attention not to fall and slowly moved forward.
The drifting air was lukewarm, and each time I inhaled, dust clung to my throat.
Outside light streamed in through a hole in the ceiling, revealing dust particles in the air along its path.
It seems that no one has entered this building for quite some time.
A thin layer of dust spread across the floor.
What is this place used for?
Numerous oval capsules were scattered throughout the large room.
Most of them were open.
They were empty.
Even if some were closed, there was nothing inside.
It seems I'm the only one in this room.
──No, to be precise, that's not true.
There are people leaning against the oval objects or lying on the floor.
But, no.
To be precise, those aren't people.
It would be more accurate to call them humanoid objects.
Those humanoid objects had mechanical parts peeking out from under their skin.
Some had mechanical parts from the neck up.
Some had exposed mechanical arms.
Some had their lower bodies torn off, revealing mechanical parts.
And then I remembered what those humanoid objects were.
Partners for humans, created for humans.
Equipped with not only the five senses but also emotions, they are the closest existence to humans.
I reached out to a Philoid that had stopped functioning.
The hand with exposed parts, not covered by skin, was very similar to my right hand.
This is a factory.
I was created here.
…But the facility must have been abandoned for some reason just before completion.
I concluded with the most likely possibility while looking at my mechanical right hand before it was covered with artificial skin.
Having understood my own existence, I started walking towards the wall.
There was an old automatic door there, and right next to it, a liquid crystal panel displaying 《CLOSE》 was covered in dust.
I touched it with my mechanical hand.
The moment I felt something cold like electricity at my bloodless fingertips, it displayed 《OPEN》 and the door opened.
Can I get outside from here?
Is anyone left in this facility?
I wanted to meet someone.
I wanted to meet a human.
Let's go find my partner.
I pushed open the door leading outside.
To prove my own existence.
When I returned home, I headed straight to the living room.
There, a broken music box sat.
I unraveled a book I borrowed from the library and learned about its structure.
As I thought, the gears inside were chipped.
That's why no matter how much I turned the handle, the disc wouldn't turn and no sound would come out.
…But, what should I do about these gears?
Would it be possible to make them to the size written in the book? No, it's impossible.
With no answer, I continued turning the pages of the book.
At the end of the book, there was a list of products for each manufacturer and a list of parts used.
As I glanced through it, my gaze caught on something.
What I understood there was that the manufacturer making this music box also made clocks.
If that's the case, the precise parts might be the same as those used in clocks.
Suddenly, I remembered what I broke at Mad's shop.
That clock…if they're going to throw it away because it's unusable…
If I used the gears and other parts from the clock, I might be able to fix the music box.
"Ray, what are you doing?"
At the same time as I saw the possibility of repair, Shiona entered the living room.
"Shiona, listen. I might be able to fix the music box with the parts from the clock that was at Mad's shop."
"Really? Really?"
Shiona had a happier smile than usual.
From that expression, I could understand Shiona's joy.
"But, don't push yourself too hard. Even without the music box, we can still sing."
Shiona picked up the music box and began to sing.
That song she sang in the chapel.
That song, somehow nostalgic.
That song, that warms the depths of my heart.
Seeing Shiona gazing so lovingly at the music box, my resolve grows stronger.
I want to fix this music box for her.
And I want to make Shiona happy.
That feeling swells up inside me.
"I'm going to Mad's shop again tomorrow."
I'll try asking him if he'll give me the clock somehow.
But there was one thing that worried me.
That is, that I was the one who broke the clock.
I apologized, but it's still hard to go there.
I'm terrified of Mad yelling at me again.
"You know, I want to make a lot of people smile with your song, Onii-chan."
Shiona's words reached me as I hesitated.
"This song is orange... I'm sure it can turn a lot of people's hearts orange. It's a song that was made with the wish for that to happen, because that's Onii-chan's wish. So, I want a lot of people to hear this song. And I want to make a lot of people smile. That's my wish."
Shiona said, as if to herself.
Those words pushed me forward.
I'll go to Mad's shop one more time tomorrow.
And I'll apologize again for breaking the clock.
Shiona's singing and the music box strengthened my resolve.
The next day, I visited Mad's shop alone.
I can't count how many times I thought about turning back along the way.
Each time, Shiona's smile passed through my mind.
I want to keep seeing that smile.
To do that, I want to fix the music box for her.
I recalled yesterday's resolution many times.
What I can do for Shiona.
I steeled myself and stepped into Mad's shop.
"What brings you here, after what you've done?"
Immediately, Mad's voice, as low as distant thunder, rained down.
I immediately wanted to run away, but I didn't.
"I wanted to apologize more sincerely for yesterday."
"About the clock? You already apologized for that."
"Shiona was there at the time... I thought I should apologize properly, by myself."
"I don't need that. Get out of here."
"I can't do that. I'm really sorry for breaking the clock yesterday."
"No matter how much you apologize, the clock is still broken, get out."
"I'm sorry. I'm really sorry."
With my head bowed, I continued to apologize.
I wonder how much time has passed.
Eventually, Mad's voice, a little softer, reached me.
"...Raise your head."
Doing as I was told, Mad's face, looking somewhat exasperated, was there.
"Jeez... what a guy. You're unbelievably persistent."
"I'm sorry..."
"Don't apologize anymore, or I'll punch you!"
He said that, but there didn't seem to be as much anger as yesterday.
I thought I heard him sigh softly.
"You're done here, right? Get out of here."
"Um... I have one favor to ask."
"A favor? You've got some nerve asking me for a favor."
The pressure made my legs tremble, but Shiona's words pushed me forward.
"That clock... could you let me have it?"
"...Say that again."
"Um... that clock from yesterday, could you let me have it--"
"ARE YOU KIDDING MEEEEEEEEEE?!"
The impact was like being struck by lightning, and I froze stiffly.
"You broke it yourself and now you want it? Don't get cocky!"
This is no good... .
I can't take any more... .
As I tried to run away, a voice called out from behind.
"Please wait, Mad. Rei just wants to fix my brother's music box."
There, standing between me and Mad, was Shiona, who was supposed to be waiting at home.
Shiona wasn't intimidated by Mad at all.
"My brother's music box is broken, and Rei said he'd fix it for me. He just needs the parts for that. He's truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday too. So, won't you please forgive him?"
Shiona told Mad with an unwavering smile.
"Hmm... hmmm..."
Mad's face was bright red, but his expression gradually softened.
"But, that clock is gone now. I threw that thing away. However..."
Mad turned his back to us, but continued to speak.
"I threw it away at the abandoned factory on the edge of town. I don't know what happened after that."
After saying only that, Mad slumped down, facing the wall.
"Thank you, Mad."
Shiona bowed politely and left the shop, still smiling.
"Ah, thank you very much..."
I bowed in the same way and left the shop.
"The abandoned factory is very close to where Rei collapsed."
Shiona told me as soon as we left the shop.
"You mean, where Shiona goes to throw away the trash?"
"That's right. Trash from all sorts of places gathers there."
"You mean, he fixes up things he finds there and sells them here?"
"That's right. Mad goes to that place often."
I see, that's why there were so many old things in the shop.
He must be bringing back anything usable from that place and reusing it.
Anyway, I decided to head to that abandoned factory.
"Shiona, I was wondering if you could guide me to that place."
"I'm sorry, the Red Children are coming to my house today."
She must be talking about those kids who were talking to Shiona yesterday.
Now that I think about it, I promised to treat them to soup.
"But Rei, you can't go alone, right? I'll go tell the children I can't make it."
"No, it's okay, Shiona. You should keep your promise."
"But, how will you get there?"
"I'll try going to the library. I want to know more about this area, and I want to look at a map."
"The library..."
Shiona's expression seemed a little clouded.
"Eh... um, it's nothing... Hey, Rei. Is Tippy fond of you?"
"I wonder. I don't think she hates me, but why do you ask?"
"Um, it's nothing. If it's the library, I'm sure there's a map. Goodbye."
"Yeah, I'll do that. Well then, see you later."
I turned on my heel and tried to head to the library.
The smile I saw on Shiona's face at that time seemed to contain some sadness.
But, I don't know the reason for it.
"Rei, you came."
Tippy was in the same place as yesterday, crying in the same way.
"Yeah, I came. Hey Tippy, can I ask you something?"
"Does this library have a map of the town?"
"Yeah, it does. It has a lot of them."
"That's good. Can you guide me to where the maps are?"
"I can... but..."
Tippy was somewhat hesitant.
"Um, that's not it... that's not it, but..."
"Will you hold me?"
Tippy's face turned a little red.
Her sad expression didn't change, but her cheeks seemed to soften just a little.
"...Hold you? Hold you, like what we did yesterday?"
"Yeah... is it no good?"
"It's not no good. Here, come here."
"Yeah... yeah..."
When I spread my arms, Tippy stood up and jumped into my chest somewhat hesitantly.
Unlike yesterday, I ended up holding her.
But my thoughts are the same.
Tippy, whom I held, was still small, soft, and seemed like she would break.
"Tippy, is this okay?"
"Yeah, it's okay. Rei... you're warm."
Tippy nuzzled my chest.
That gesture warmed the depths of my heart.
Could this be the emotion called love?
I want to protect this girl.
I want to stop these tears.
For a while, I held Tippy close.
"Um, walk over there like this."
Tippy pointed her finger towards the aisle from within my chest.
Still holding her, I headed in the direction she indicated.
"Why do you need a map?"
"There seems to be an abandoned factory near the town. I want to go there."
"Why, to the abandoned factory?"
"There might be a part I'm looking for there."
"The music box you were looking at yesterday?"
"Yeah, that's right. I really want to fix Shiona's brother's music box."
"Shiona's... I see. I hope you find it."
Still held in my arms, Tippy led me without hesitation to the bookshelf where the map books were kept.
"Do you remember where each book is, by any chance?"
"Yeah, mostly."
"That's amazing... Did someone teach you?"
"Nope. I did it myself while waiting for my mommy and daddy."
When she said the words 'mommy and daddy,' Tippy's eyes became a little teary.
"Um... could it be this one?"
To change the subject, I took out a map book.
I sat down on the spot and opened the book.
Like the music box book, this map was also handwritten.
Could it be that all the books in this library are handwritten?
If that's the case, that's a considerable amount.
Just who wrote this many books by hand?
The thought of the endless time required for that task made me feel faint.
"It's quite tattered... About how old is this book?"
"Um... I don't know. It's a really, really, reeeeally old book."
It seemed like a map from decades ago.
The buildings themselves seem to be the same as the current townscape, though...
The pages were badly faded, as if tea had been spilled on them.
Some were stuck together and looked like they would tear if I tried to turn them.
I carefully turned the page.
"Ah, could it be this one?"
I found a factory map symbol to the north of the town.
Considering the direction of Shiona's house, there's a high probability it's this location.
"Rei... are you going? Don't go..."
Tippy clung to my neck.
I gently stroked her small back with my hand several times.
"It's okay, I'll come again."
"Really? Will you really come again?"
"Yeah, of course. I promise."
"You absolutely will, okay? You absolutely, absolutely have to come again."
"Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely for sure."
I made the promise to Tippy over and over again.
I wonder why.
Even so, I felt reluctant to leave.
The feeling that I want to stay by Tippy's side forever is welling up inside me.
Hiding that feeling, I left the library.
Relying on the map, I entered the abandoned factory and was hit by the smell of oxidized oil.
This factory probably used to make Philoid arms and legs as well.
Nearby, unfinished Philoid arms and leg parts were scattered everywhere.
All of them were before being covered with artificial skin, with the mechanical parts exposed.
Looking closely, I could see that they were made in the same way as my right hand.
Even knowing they were artificial, the sight was bizarre.
To move a rolling arm, I pushed it away with my right hand.
The mournful sound of metal clashing echoed within the factory.
If I accidentally break any part of my body, I'll come here.
Here, there are mountains of replacement parts.
In the back, there were many drums filled with oxidized oil rolling around.
Most of it had oxidized, but some of the oil was still unopened.
Even if I run out of oil, I can perform maintenance here without being seen.
The further I went into the factory, the more the worries I had in the back of my mind were resolved.
This abandoned factory should become an important place for me.
But, I can't find the crucial thing.
That is, of course, the watch that Mad threw away in this place.
But, inside this factory, there isn't even a watch, let alone anything that looks like trash.
Could it be that the trash wasn't thrown inside the factory, but outside?
I left the factory for a while and decided to go around its perimeter.
Then, on the back side of the factory, I was able to find an area piled high with machine parts.
There were machine parts, of course, but also a lot of trash was dumped there.
Surely this place has become the town's garbage dump.
Besides Mad, there must be others who have taken things that could be useful from here.
Looking up at the mountain that was many times my height, I thought about that.
"...Now then, where could it be?"
There's a considerable amount of trash.
It would be difficult to find it by searching steadily.
But, there's no other way.
I immediately decided to start searching from my feet.
I don't know how much time passed.
I had long since lost my sense of time.
Because I was moving muddy metal plates and containers full of waste oil, my hands were covered in sludge.
Oil was thickly stuck to my clothes, and before I knew it, there were a lot of stains.
Even after that, I crossed the carpet of garbage, swam in the river of filth, and was hit by the waterfall of scrap.
And then, I finally found it.
It was at Mad's shop.
The one I broke yesterday.
That watch.
I picked it up and stared intently at the hands on the dial.
Naturally, it wasn't moving.
I put it to my ear, but it didn't make any sound.
It's only natural, since I broke it.
This watch will probably never tick again.
That fact pricked the depths of my heart slightly.
Gently, I hugged the watch and decided to start heading home.
Shiona will gently welcome me.
"I'm home. I found it."
When I held out the oil-stained spoils, Shiona smiled gently.
"Really, thank you. Here, change your clothes, change your clothes."
Shiona had prepared a towel and a change of clothes for me.
After wiping off the dirt and changing my clothes, I headed to the living room.
There, Shiona welcomed me again.
"Rei, you're tired, aren't you? Eat some food and rest."
"No, I'm okay. I want to start working right away."
"Are you okay? I'm worried about your body, Rei."
"I'm fine. Strangely, I don't feel tired right now."
"But, if you don't eat..."
"Yeah, I know. I'll eat later, so go ahead and eat first."
"...Okay, I understand. Do your best."
Shiona leaves the living room.
Seeing her off, I started working.
I opened the book I borrowed from the library beside me.
This music box has a mechanism where gears of various sizes inside intricately mesh together when the handle is turned, and the disc rotates at a constant speed.
Apparently, turning it faster doesn't necessarily make the song faster.
I thought that was a pretty amazing technology.
Following the assembly instructions written in the book in reverse order, I disassemble the music box.
Then, as I compare the presence or absence of parts in order, I find that a gear in the power transmission part is broken.
Is it that things with precise movements stop working just because a single small part fails?
I can't help but look at my right hand.
For now, I'll try to find something the same size as this broken gear from the clock.
I then began disassembling the clock.
I removed the lid and used a screwdriver to remove the screws.
When I removed the cover, the internal structure was exposed.
Gears much more precise than those in the music box meshed together in multiple layers.
One of them, a slightly larger gear, had a broken shaft. That's why the parts weren't turning.
I guess this is the place I broke yesterday.
The fact that Mad threw this clock away means that he didn't have anything the same size as this gear.
Fortunately, the broken gear wasn't the size needed for the music box.
Disassembling things makes me feel a little hesitant.
Because I'm breaking this clock to fix the music box.
Is it because I understand for myself what kind of existence I am?
Hesitating, but as a small offering, I disassembled the clock as carefully as possible.
I lined up the clock gears on the table in order from smallest to largest, and compared them to those of the music box.
"...Found it."
I was able to find a gear that was almost the same size as the one I needed.
Now, all that's left is to transplant this into the music box according to the book.
"I think this should be okay..."
The disc should move without any problems now.
I put the lid back on and turned the handle, and there was a response.
But the handle won't turn any further.
Why?
I reread the book.
The parts and the installation positions are correct.
Tilting my head, I removed the lid again.
Then, I tried turning the handle as it was.
Certainly, the gears meshed perfectly.
But it seems that the oil has completely dried up because it hasn't been used for a while.
That must be the reason why the handle won't turn.
What should I do?
Should I go to Shiona and borrow some cooking oil?
...No, that's also a problem.
Cooking oil and gear lubricant are probably different types.
It might work at first, but it could cause a breakdown.
Then, what should I do...?
Suddenly, I looked at my right hand.
Although covered by a glove, underneath are exposed mechanical parts.
What about using the oil used in my hand?
I took off my glove and carefully examined my right hand.
Exposed mechanical parts.
Oil is incorporated inside to smoothly move those parts.
I inserted a screwdriver into the palm near the base of my thumb.
When I removed the exterior, it was packed with mechanisms such as wiring, cylinders, and shafts to move the mechanical hand.
One of the cylinders inside contains oil.
And it was detachable so that the old oil could be easily replaced.
I removed the cylinder with my left hand and dripped the oil that filled it onto the gears of the music box.
I spread the oil with my fingertip so that it would blend into all the gears as much as possible.
Will it work?
I returned the cylinder to my right hand and reattached the exterior.
Hiding the mechanical arm with a glove, I cautiously turned the handle as it was.
Stiffly at first. But, as I turned the handle, the gears ran smoothly.
The oil must have circulated through all the gaps in the gears, and the handle continued to turn without any snags.
And that melody begins to play.
"Ray, that song...!"
Shiona suddenly came into the room.
"Yeah. It's fixed, Shiona."
"Thank you... Thank you, Ray. Thank you... I'm so, so happy."
Shiona showed me a smile I had never seen before.
Just looking at that smile, the depths of my heart warmed up gently.
And then, I realized.
Ah, so this is it.
This is the emotion called happiness.
I am happy now.
I am happy to see Shiona's smile.
And, for the first time, I was able to get a sense of being useful.
"Thank you, Ray, thank you."
Shiona took my hand and thanked me many times.
I felt my face getting hot as her face got closer.
"Thanks to Ray's hard work, the music box is fixed. I can listen to that song again, which I had given up on. This orange-colored song that my brother made. This song that I love so much..."
"Hey, Shiona, sing it. Let me hear your brother's song."
"Yes... of course!"
I turn the handle of the music box.
Shiona put her hands together in front of her chest and began to sing along with the melody.
The song she was singing when we met.
A song Shiona's brother made.
An orange-colored song.
I feel like I understand its meaning now.
The emotion residing in my heart is joy.
Shiona's song.
And Shiona, singing so happily.
Just looking at her like that, joy overflowed.
More than ever, Shiona seemed happy as she sang that song.
That day, Shiona kept singing until she fell asleep.
I was also absorbed in her singing voice and the melody.
Again and again, Shiona asked me to play the song.
Shiona kept singing until her arms could no longer move.
Looking at her expression, I think.
I want to be with Shiona like this forever.
If Shiona wishes for it, I can be with her forever.
But for that to happen, my true identity must never be revealed.
Never, absolutely never...
That day, I solidified my resolve to stay with Shiona forever.
Night, in the darkened room.
On the two beds placed side by side, Shiona speaks to me.
"Will you listen to my request?"
"You see, I want many people to hear this song. And I want to make them smile. I want to make many people happy with this song that my brother made."
I only know the words.
But I didn't understand what it was.
Is it a state?
Or is it an emotion?
I repeatedly reflect on the word 'happiness' in my mind.
"So, I want you to help me."
"Help? What should I do?"
"Tomorrow, I want you to go to the plaza with me. And I want you to turn the music box."
"And then, Shiona will sing, right?"
"Yes, that's right. And I want as many people as possible to hear it. That orange-colored song that my brother made..."
"Yeah, I want to do that too. Of course, I'll help."
I heard the sound of the sheets rustling.
"What's wrong, Shiona?"
"Hey, Ray... can I hold your hand?"
I can't see Shiona's expression in the darkness.
But I felt like Shiona's face was turning red.
"Hand? With me?"
"Yes, I want to hold hands with you, Ray... is it no good...?"
I search through my knowledge banks.
I know the action of holding hands.
But what it means between a boy and girl of that age...
"No, it's okay..."
If I am needed by a human... by Shiona, then I want to respond.
Fortunately, she is on my left side.
If it's the hand covered in artificial skin, I think it's okay.
I reach my hand over to the bed next to mine.
In the cold room, my outstretched hand felt a little chilly.
I search for Shiona's hand in the air.
Touching, warmth.
Shiona's hand overlapped with mine.
"You're warm, Ray."
"Yeah... you're warm, Shiona."
We held hands.
Without either of us initiating, our fingers intertwined.
A warmth spread, not just from the warmth emitted from our hands.
Is this the warmth of a human, different from my artificial warmth...?
"Ray... tighter."
"...Like... this...?"
"Sorry, did it hurt?"
"No... it was just stronger than I expected."
"Is this strength okay?"
"Yeah... thank you, Ray."
We held hands all night long.
Until the morning awakened us, our hands remained connected.
The next day, the plaza was overflowing with sound.
The melody that Shiona and I began to play.
Shiona is singing.
And I am turning Shiona's brother's music box.
At first, there were no passersby.
But as if drawn by Shiona's singing voice, the number increased.
One person, two people stopped, and soon a small circle formed.
That circle quickly grew larger, and the deserted plaza quickly became lively.
Everyone there is absorbed in Shiona's singing voice.
A young couple snuggled close, holding each other's hands.
An old man closed his eyes with deep emotion.
A young man gazed at a woman a little distance away.
A young parent and child laughed happily together.
The children were moving their bodies to the rhythm of the song.
Each person was listening to Shiona's song with their own thoughts and feelings.
But there was one thing they all had in common.
That was that everyone was 'smiling'.
Everyone who listened to Shiona's song had a smile on their face.
Now, I felt warmth deep within my chest as I felt I was helping to bring smiles to the faces of the people in this place.
This is the emotion called happiness.
The emotion I felt yesterday when I saw Shiona's smile.
This is what it was.
I am happy.
I felt my cheeks lift slightly.
Surely, I am smiling too.
It might be a slightly clumsy-looking smile.
But that's okay.
If I can get even a little closer to Shiona, I'll be satisfied with just that.
The music box, which I had just repaired, continued to play the melody flawlessly.
The handle I turn is also in good condition.
The sound flowing from the disc resonates and amplifies within the wooden box, becoming a clear tone that goes outside.
According to Shiona, it's an orange-colored melody.
Shiona sings along with that melody.
I wished this time would last forever.
This time that brings smiles to people's faces.
And I wanted to keep watching Shiona's happy profile as she sang, forever and ever.
Suddenly, my gaze drifted towards the library on the edge of town.
I thought the closed curtains fluttered slightly.
For a moment, I even saw a small figure.
I know who it is.
That blue girl who's always crying.
Tipi.
She's probably still crying now.
In that lonely library--.
Just thinking about it made a small pain in my chest.
Like a thorn pricking me.
I wonder how Tipi was looking at this circle of people.
The ever-expanding circle of smiles.
Everyone there was smiling and sharing the same feeling.
I noticed that there was one person with a scowl in that circle.
That person with the hunched shoulders and folded arms is Mad.
He was so out of place, the only one with 'anger' written all over his face.
I accidentally made eye contact with Mad, who held that emotion I didn't yet know.
It was less than a second.
Mad immediately scoffed and turned on his heel, disappearing into the crowd.
Seeing that, I thought.
I want to make everyone smile.
Those two expressing sadness and anger.
I want to make Tipi and Mad smile.
But, what should I do?
I kept thinking about that as I turned the handle of the music box.
After the song ended, I went to Mad's shop alone.
I couldn't shake off that scowl from earlier.
I cautiously stepped into the shop, still dim and eerie as ever.
There weren't any customers.
Only Mad was sitting in the chair at the register.
But something was off.
Unlike before, he wasn't leaning back in his chair.
He was just staring intently at what looked like a small, rectangular chip in his hand.
His expression was still stern, but there was also a hint of loneliness about him.
"Um... Mad-san?"
When I called out to him, Mad looked flustered and hid the chip in his palm.
"W-what do you want? Why did you come in here without permission?"
"It's not like I broke in. It's a shop, so anyone can enter, right...?"
"Don't be ridiculous! You're an impudent brat to enter my shop without my permission!!"
He's saying something completely unreasonable.
"But, Mad-san, you were so focused on that chip that you didn't even notice me coming in."
"I'm talking about the chip you're hiding in your palm."
"I'm not hiding anything!!"
"But I saw you. If you're not hiding it, then open your hand and show me what's inside--"
"Shut up and get out! And don't you ever come back againnnnn!!"
As if pushed out by his words, I was kicked out of Mad-san's shop.
I came here to make Mad-san smile, but I'm doing the exact opposite.
Shiona was waiting for me in front of the shop.
Her smile warmed my heart a little.
"Huh? Why are you here, Shiona?"
"I was worried about where you were going, Rei, so I followed you."
"I came here to try and make Mad-san smile. But I just made him angry again..."
"Make Mad-san smile...? That's a very difficult thing to do. So don't worry about it. Mad-san getting angry is normal."
"But he seemed angrier than usual today."
"More than usual? Did something happen?"
"I don't really know, but I asked him about the chip."
"...Chip?"
"Yeah, a rectangular chip that fits in the palm of your hand. Mad-san was staring intently at it..."
I showed Shiona the size of the chip Mad-san was holding with my fingers.
Shiona's eyes widened slightly, as if she recognized the chip.
"Could it be that you asked him about that chip?"
"That's right. And then he suddenly got angry--"
"I see, I see. Rei, it can't be helped."
"Can't be helped? What do you mean?"
"That chip is Mad-san's treasure."
"Mad-san's treasure? What's inside it?"
"It should contain a movie that Mad-san's son made."
"His son's movie? Is Mad-san's son a film director?"
"Yes, he is. But he left this town a long time ago and hasn't come back since."
Shiona said, looking at the shop.
With a strange expression that was a mix of being troubled and not letting go of her smile...
"But why is he just staring at the chip? Why doesn't he just watch the movie?"
"That's impossible. There's no equipment in this town that can play that chip."
"So, Mad-san is staring at it like that because he wants to see it but can't?"
"I'm sure that's it. He's shy, so he won't say it out loud."
At that moment, I had an idea.
A way to make Mad-san, who always has a scowl and is always angry, smile.
"No, it's nothing. Shiona, go back ahead. I have somewhere I want to stop by."
"Somewhere you want to stop by...?"
"Yeah, there's something I want to look into."
"...The library?"
I thought I saw Shiona make a slightly surprised expression.
She's probably worried about me since I'm still not used to the town.
"I promise I won't be late."
I said clearly, trying to ease Shiona's worries.
Shiona opened her mouth as if to say something, but closed it immediately.
And once. She made a gesture as if lightly biting her lip for just a moment, then smiled.
"...Okay. Be careful, Rei."
I parted ways with Shiona in front of Mad-san's shop and started walking through the town alone.
The inside of the library was as dim as ever, and the air was stagnant.
I headed straight through the maze-like interior without hesitation.
To the blue girl who is always crying--.
"Rei, you came."
Tipi stood up and rushed over when she saw me.
I gently held her small body.
"Yeah, I promised."
"Thank you, Rei. I'm happy."
Tipi buried her face in my stomach.
I could feel tears flowing through my clothes.
"Tipi, what were you doing?"
"Drawing a picture, come here, Rei."
Holding my hand, Tipi led me along.
There were drawing paper and crayons scattered where Tipi had been sitting.
There was a half-finished picture in the drawing paper.
"Did you draw this, Tipi?"
"Yes. I draw one every day."
Tipi said, and resumed drawing.
I peered into the picture.
There was a picture of a singing girl and a boy turning a music box.
"Tipi, could this be...?"
"It's Rei and Shiona. Singing in the plaza."
So Tipi was watching us from behind the curtain after all.
Thinking of Tipi watching us alone, for some reason, my chest ached a little.
"Rei, what's wrong? Are you hurt somewhere?"
The eyes of the girl looking up were filled with sorrow.
I put my hand on Tipi's head as if to comfort that emotion.
"It's okay, it's nothing. It's a very good picture."
"Yeah... thank you, I'm happy."
When I stroke her head, Tipi snuggles up to me affectionately.
But her face is fragile and sad--.
I sincerely wanted to see this child smile.
"You said you draw one every day, but are there other pictures?"
"Yes, there are. Rei, come here."
Tipi stood up, took my hand, and led me deeper into the library.
There, the pictures were.
Tipi must have put them up herself; many pictures were pasted on the wall in a low position.
"This is the picture I drew yesterday, this is the day before that, this is the day before that..."
Tipi explained each one to me.
A picture of a girl holding hands with a young man, looking happy.
A young man and another girl visiting the girl.
And a picture of a girl crying alone.
Ah, I see.
This is Tipi's picture diary.
From then on, there were pictures of a girl continuing to cry alone.
Since I came here, Tipi hasn't been alone anymore.
The expression on the girl in the picture seemed a little softer.
Surely that is Tipi's emotion itself.
But it is still just something that contains sadness.
I wanted to make this girl smile too.
What can I do for that?
I can't think of an answer.
The only thing I can say is to be by Tipi's side like this.
"Hey Rei, what kind of book did you come to look for today?"
Tipi, with a sad expression, pulled on my sleeve and looked up at me.
"I'm looking for a device that can project images... Is there a book that explains that?"
"Yes, there is. It's a little far from here, though."
"Will you guide me?"
"Yes, okay. Here!"
Then Tipi spread out her arms.
The bear stuffed animal in her right hand dangled in the air.
"Hold me."
I picked Tipi up.
As before, she rubbed her cheek against my chest.
"It's that way, Rei."
I started guiding her to the book I was looking for.
The book is on the second floor of the library--.
A corner of the shelf where materials on images from ancient and modern times, such as projectors and projection machines, are collected.
"The book you want to read is definitely here."
The books lined up on the bookshelf were all handwritten, just like the music box books and maps.
However, there seem to be quite a few types of projectors, some using film and some using discs.
"What kind are you looking for?"
"I'm looking for something that can project a chip about this size, do you know?"
I used my fingers to show the size of the chip that Mad had.
"Hmm... square? Or a square with only one corner missing?"
"The corner was... like it was missing diagonally... I think."
I hadn't looked at it very closely, so I couldn't say for sure.
But Tipi nodded slightly.
"Is that shape the chip that Mad has?"
"Yes, it's the chip that Mad had."
I was surprised that Tipi knew about Mad, but it wasn't strange since he was the owner of the general store in this town.
Siona knew about Mad's chip too, and maybe everyone in town knew.
And the fact that Mad is stubborn and won't let anyone see what's inside is probably common knowledge.
"Um, well... if that's the case... then... this."
Standing on her tiptoes, Tipi pointed to a book that was on the very top shelf she could reach.
"That's amazing, Tipi. You really do remember the location of all the books."
"Ehehe. I got praised."
Tipi pressed her face against my stomach.
While stroking her head, I picked up the book and checked its contents.
It was more like an instruction manual than a book.
『Mumei Company Projector』──The types of playable media and chips are written in detail.
The internal structure and wiring were also carefully written down.
It seems to be a projection-type player that can project the contents recorded on a portable chip onto a screen or white wall.
If I can find this device, I can show Mad the movie inside the chip.
"Thank you, Tipi, I found the information I wanted."
"...Are you leaving already?"
Tipi looked up at me with a sad expression.
"...Yeah, sorry."
"Nooo. Don't go."
Perhaps she intended to stop me from leaving.
Tipi hugged me.
Her innocent warmth shook my resolve.
But I have to go.
Because I want to make Mad happy right now.
Because I want to see Mad's smile.
"Tipi, I promise. I'll definitely come again tomorrow."
"Tomorrow...? Really...?"
"Yeah, really. I promise."
"...You won't disappear, will you?"
"No, I won't disappear. I'll come to see you every day, without fail."
"...Okay. I'll be waiting."
With lingering reluctance, I left the library, leaving behind the blue-haired girl—Tipi.
"You came again! What did you come here for!!!"
As soon as I visited the store, Mad's roar greeted me.
I want to run away.
I want to cover my ears.
But I didn't.
Because I wanted to fulfill Mad's wish.
"Mad-san, I have a request. Please lend me your son's chip."
"The chip with your son's movie on it."
"Why should I lend it to you? Don't be ridiculous!!"
"Please... please."
"Enough with your meddling! It's a nuisance!"
"I... I want to be helpful to you, Mad-san!!"
"Helpful, you say?"
Mad's gaze became even sharper, and fear began to take hold, constricting my throat.
The movable parts of my knees lost their strength, and I felt lightheaded.
I want to run away right now... but I can't hesitate here.
"I heard about that chip from Siona. That your son left town to become a film director. Isn't that a movie sent from your son? But you couldn't watch it because you didn't have the playback device, am I wrong?"
I rushed my words to suppress my fear.
Perhaps pushed by that momentum, Mad looked at me with a slightly surprised face.
"I went to the library earlier. To find out which device could play it."
"You... you went to the library...?"
Mad looked even more surprised at the word 'library'.
"Yes... I'll find a device that can play that chip. If the player is broken, I'll fix it. If I can't find one, I'll even make one by connecting various parts."
"Why would you go so far? It's none of your business."
"It may not be my business. But I want to do it."
"I want to be helpful to Mad-san... that's all. So, please."
Silence followed.
Is this a silence of affirmation, or—.
"That guy was the worst, a stupid son."
Mad sat down in his chair and looked up at the ceiling.
And with a somewhat sad expression, he began to talk to me.
All we ever did was fight.
Every time we met, a fight would start.
So, from some point on, he started avoiding me.
No, maybe I was the one who was avoiding him.
Anyway, we stopped seeing each other often.
So, when he told me he wanted to talk, I was surprised.
"I'm leaving this town."
"Leaving town? What are you talking about?"
"I'm leaving this town to become a film director. I guess I really do love movies."
"Stop talking about dreams and face reality. Someone like you can't be a director. There's no way you can do it."
"Don't decide it's impossible! You won't know unless you try!"
"I know. I'm your father. Nobody will watch a movie by a director without talent."
"There are people who recognize me! I've produced results! You're just the only one who doesn't acknowledge it!"
"You can't even dream in a town like this!"
"A town like this? Say that again."
"I'll say it as many times as you want. I can't stand a life where I spend my whole life in a store like this in a town like this."
"You... enough..."
"I'll say it as many times as I want! You're just afraid of changing!"
"Ever since Mom died, you've been doing the same thing every day—"
Without thinking, I hit him.
"...You always resort to violence. I've had enough."
"...I understand. Get out."
"Yeah, I will. Just keep doing the same thing here forever."
My son left home.
And since then, he hasn't even sent a single message.
The only thing he sent was this movie on this chip.
How am I supposed to watch something when I don't have a playback device?
I can't forgive him for being so selfish.
I don't want to watch a movie like this.
I don't want to see his face even more.
I was surprised by Mad-san's unusual loquacity.
The more I heard his feelings, the more my own feelings grew.
If Mad-san really hated his son, he wouldn't need to keep the chip that he couldn't play.
If his son hated Mad-san, he wouldn't have sent him the movie he made.
Surely, he wants Mad-san to see this movie.
I think he sent that chip to Mad-san with some kind of feelings.
That's why I want to show Mad-san this movie.
I bowed my head again.
"Please! Lend me the chip!"
Mad-san came in front of me in silence.
I was prepared to be yelled at, but I no longer felt fear.
More than that, my desire to be helpful to Mad-san was stronger.
But Mad-san handed me the chip he was holding.
"Do whatever you want."
I looked at the chip I received again.
It was a metal core covered in organic glass, running iridescent electronic circuits.
I knew what it was. A general-purpose chip also used for Phylloid's memory backup.
It had become a world standard, and most manufacturers had adopted this format.
If that's the case, it might be playable even without a Mume Company projector.
I clenched the chip and bowed my head toward where Mad-san was.
A deserted factory on the edge of town.
I had stepped into the mountain of garbage behind it.
I thought this abandoned factory was the only place where there might be a device to play Mad-san's chip.
If there was one in town, he would have played it long ago.
There's a lot of equipment mixed in with the garbage.
Wires that have been cut off, things that have rusted.
As far as I can see, it's all unusable.
The possibility of finding the projector itself in this place is low. But I think I can find at least some parts, like the circuit board.
That's right, like I told Mad-san, I'll connect the parts and assemble something that can play the chip.
This is the only place I can rely on.
If I don't do something here, Mad-san will have that same expression forever.
I won't let that happen.
I don't want that to happen.
With only that in mind, I break down the scrap heap.
But no matter how much I search, I can't find the device I'm looking for.
I'm sure Mad-san has searched for it before.
No... Maybe Mad-san is still searching for it even now.
Siona said. Mad-san fixes things he picks up at this dump and sells them at the general store.
Isn't his real purpose to find a projector to play his son's chip?
If that's the case, what does Mad-san feel when he hasn't been able to find it...?
Instead of a projector, he picks up something else... What was he thinking when he was repairing it...?
I broke Mad-san's watch.
Ah... I see... That's why Mad-san was angry.
That watch was part of the process of trying to retrieve something important to Mad-san.
This is speculation. But I want to believe that's the case.
If so, I won't be able to easily find what Mad-san has been searching for all along.
Even so, I won't give up.
Finding the projector will be the greatest atonement for Mad-san for breaking the watch...!
It was when I dragged a piece of equipment bigger than my body.
I felt something strange in my right hand.
A very small discomfort... I feel stiffness in the movement of the joints of my fingers.
Is the oil running out, or has something broken down?
It might not be a good idea to continue working like this.
I couldn't stop moving my hands.
Mad-san must have searched the area within reach.
I look up at the mountain of scrap iron piled up far higher than my own height.
If I, who weigh less than Mad-san, might be able to climb it.
Thinking that, I immediately started climbing the unmaintained, awkward stairs.
I could feel the water hitting my back.
Large raindrops were pouring down from the sky I looked up at.
"Rei, let's stop now."
A voice came from a position lower than my feet.
When I turned around, Siona was there.
She was looking up at me, getting wet in the rain.
"It's raining. You'll catch a cold if you stay like this."
"I'm okay, I'll look a little longer, thank you."
"Even if you don't find it, Mad-san will be happy because you tried so hard."
"I'm okay, Siona. Just a little longer."
I continued working.
From behind me, Siona spoke to me unilaterally.
"But you're already soaking wet. Let's stop. You're tired, aren't you? No one will blame Rei for giving up."
Soothingly.
"I'm worried about your body, let's stop? I'll be sad if you get hurt, Rei. ...It's also important to give up."
"There might be other ways, so let's go home today. I'm preparing orange fluffy soup."
"Let's go home... Rei, let's go home... Hey, Rei... I'm worried about you, Rei..."
Even so, I continued.
Undeterred by the pouring rain, I kept searching.
I pulled out a rusted iron plate.
At that moment, a small avalanche of scrap metal occurred.
I retreated, avoiding the scrap metal that pierced the ground at my feet with a roar.
"Dangerous, Rei!"
Turning around at Siona's voice, I saw a mountain of scrap metal pouring down from behind.
The mountain that had been piled up behind me was also collapsing in the same way.
While being swallowed up, I somehow ran up the collapsing scrap metal.
After a while, the avalanche subsided, and only the sound of rain remained in the area again.
"Are you okay, Rei? Are you hurt?"
"Yeah, somehow... that was dangerous."
"Really... I'm glad you're safe, I'm glad..."
Siona let out a sigh of relief.
As if to prove my safety, I stood up.
"Ah... Rei, that."
Siona pointed to my feet with wide eyes.
The mountain of scrap metal that had collapsed earlier. Among them was a piece of equipment that I recognized.
It was the same equipment that was in the book Tipi had shown me.
I dug it out and looked at the surface of the device, and there it was, written in faded letters: 'Mume'.
"I found it... Siona, this is it! I found it!"
I lifted it up high so Siona could see it.
The water that had accumulated inside flowed out as I tilted it.
"I did it, I did it, Siona! I finally found it! Now Mad-san can watch the movie!"
"Yeah, but... I think that machine is broken...?"
"Huh?"
Siona said that, and I brought the hand holding the device in front of my eyes.
Indeed, the device I found—'Mume Corporation's projector'—had obvious signs of damage.
The lens needed for projection was missing.
Also, there was a large crack in the top, and when I peeked inside, the internal circuit board was covered in rust.
With this, I can't project a movie.
"That's too bad... Rei, shall we go home now?"
Siona's hand was offered to me.
I placed my hand on top of that hand.
That warmth warmed my rain-chilled hand.
By the time we returned to town, the rain had stopped.
But the inside of my heart didn't clear up.
Can I really repair the projector I'm holding in both hands?
In my heart, I was determined to fix it, but now that I've witnessed how tattered it is, that resolve wavers.
"What's wrong, getting all soaked like that?"
On the way back to the church, I was suddenly called out.
Standing there when I turned around was the director of the photo studio who had taken my picture before.
"I was just looking for something."
"Looking for something...? I see. So, did you find what you were looking for?"
"Yes... but..."
"Is something wrong?"
"I found it, but it's broken and unusable."
Siona answered for me, who was feeling dejected.
"I see. That's too bad. By the way, what were you planning to use it for?"
"Actually... I wanted to play the chip that Mad-san has."
"Mad-san's? The chip that was sent from his son, right?"
"...Yes. I wanted to make Mad-san, who is always angry, happy..."
"Is that something you truly want to do from the bottom of your heart?"
The director asked gently, yet as if testing me.
"Yes, of course."
I answered without hesitation.
"Mad-san... always has an angry face and looks very pained. I'm sure if there's a chance, he'll smile. I think people can be happy if they can smile. And I think other people who see that can be happy too."
Having said that, I look at Siona.
"I... learned that from Siona."
Siona looked surprised at my words, but she soon smiled.
Yeah, that's the expression. Someone's smile makes the people around them feel happy too.
The moment Siona smiled at me, my heart warmed up as well.
I see... would you mind showing it to me?
The director pointed at the projector I was holding. I silently offered the broken device.
The photo studio director carefully examined the device.
I see, this is terrible. There are too many missing parts to even try to fix it.
Hearing that from the director, who always takes care of his cameras, makes me feel discouraged.
Perhaps noticing my depressed mood, the director returned the projector with a wry smile.
Rei, shall we go home soon? You'll catch a cold.
That's right. Staying wet in the rain isn't good for you. We should go home and change first.
Any more than this and we'll trouble the director too much.
Even if I'm okay, the human Siona will catch a cold.
Hugging the projector, I bowed to the director and we headed towards the church.
When we returned to the church, Siona wiped my head with a fluffy towel.
Gently, softly, dabbing carefully so as not to rub.
That's too bad about the projector.
...Yeah, but that place was originally a garbage dump, so it's only natural that it's broken.
It's something I should have realized with a little thought. But I was hoping for a convenient turn of events.
That if I wished for it, something would happen. That if I worked hard, the results would surely follow.
I'm reminded that reality isn't that sweet.
It can't be helped. Rei did his best, so no one will complain.
But... but, I wanted to show Mad-san a movie.
Yeah... Rei, you're kind.
It's not kindness or anything like that. I just think it's my role.
But just that feeling alone will make Mad-san happy. That's enough.
I hope so...
For now, let's warm up? I'll go make us some drinks that will warm both our bodies and hearts.
Folding the towel she used to wipe my head, Siona smiled and headed towards the kitchen.
Sitting down on a chair, I let out a sigh.
I look at the broken projector placed on the table.
...No, there's no point in being depressed.
Even though it's broken, if I think about it from a place of having nothing, I've made some progress.
If I fix this projector little by little, I should be able to play the chip someday.
The book I borrowed from Tipi had instructions on how to disassemble it for maintenance.
If I unravel it in order, I should be able to fix it.
And I can look for the missing parts one by one at that factory.
I want Mad-san to smile. I want to see an expression of joy, like Siona's when the music box was fixed.
I renew my resolve to fix the projector.
Just then, I notice that the church's main hall is becoming lively.
Excuse me.
Opening the door and peeking inside, I saw the photo studio director standing there.
And behind him, even more people from the town.
What's going on?
I asked, puzzled, and the townspeople smiled as they offered me something.
This is a part from our broken clock. I thought it might be useful.
I thought this wiring might fit.
Use my light!
No, use my light!
We have plenty of tools at our place, so feel free to use as many as you need.
Various electrical components, wiring equipment, electronic circuits, gears, and screws were placed on the table one after another.
Unable to understand the scene, I was stunned, and the director smiled kindly.
Um, what is this?
You're going to fix that projector, right? When I told everyone about it, they brought things they thought you might need. There might be some unnecessary things, but it's always good to have materials, right?
Why would you do that...?
Everyone here was moved by your and Siona's music and song. They really wanted to thank you. ...I'm one of them too.
The director took out a lens and handed it to me.
This... It's a camera lens, I wonder if it will fit?
I felt something warm deep inside my chest.
And that warmth gradually welled up, higher and higher.
Eventually, that warmth reached the depths of my eyes, becoming hotter and hotter.
Words wouldn't come together properly in my head. I wanted to say something, but only my lips trembled.
Siona, holding a steaming cup, was gently watching me like that.
Siona... I feel warm deep inside my chest. Why is that?
Rei, that's an emotion called 'joy'.
Saying that, she approached me and handed me a cup filled with a drink that smelled heart-warming.
Everyone is responding to your desire to make Mad-san smile, Rei. Everyone is thinking about making Mad-san happy, with you at the center.
I wonder if I'm not being a nuisance... even though I started this on my own.
If they thought you were a nuisance, everyone wouldn't have such warm smiles.
I looked at the townspeople who had brought the parts, one by one.
They held up their respective parts in their hands, showing them to me, and smiled.
...Thank you, everyone.
Using the parts and tools I received, I started repairing it on the spot.
I proceeded with the help of various people in areas I didn't understand on my own.
I removed the moisture, carefully sanded off the rusted parts, and repaired the broken electronic circuits with copper foil.
I used the tip of a screwdriver heated until it turned red to fix the solder that was about to come off.
No, no, it's not like that, it's like this!
No, no, it's like this here!
You're both wrong! It's definitely like this here!
Not like this, like that.
Noisily, but cheerfully, the repair was carried out by everyone.
And then, finally--.
The repair was finished, in a patchwork, clumsy state.
Thank you, everyone.
It's nothing. In return, let us hear that song again.
The children love it. Please do it again.
Listening to it with him really sets a good mood.
Listening to that song... it reminds me of the old days...
I love that song, it's so much fun!
A clumsy machine made by everyone.
It looked nothing like the ones I'd seen in books.
But it was a one-of-a-kind projector, made by everyone.
I felt more joy than I ever had before.
Everyone there was genuinely happy about its completion.
All that's left is to test it out.
Hearing about the test run, I looked around the room.
Come to think of it, I've never seen electricity in this town.
The photo studio also used an analog camera.
Um... is it possible that this town doesn't have electricity...?
At my question, everyone in the room suddenly looked shocked.
It was an awkwardness, like I'd touched on something I shouldn't have.
Even the director who suggested the test run was silent.
"It's a library, you know."
It was Shiona who spoke, breaking the awkward silence.
"This town doesn't have electricity, but the power storage facility is still here."
"That's the library?"
"Yeah, that's right."
It was as if a ray of hope had shone through.
I felt my cheeks soften.
But Shiona's expression... even though she was smiling, her eyes looked sad.
The next day, I went to the library with Shiona.
I brought the handmade projector that I made with the townspeople yesterday.
"I didn't know there was a device like this here."
The library counter was equipped with a device that used sunlight to store electricity in portable batteries.
Apparently, it's the only device left in this town.
However, due to the aging of the solar panels, it's not possible to generate a large amount of electricity.
Electricity is a precious resource for this town.
Despite my selfishness, everyone in town allowed me to use such a precious thing.
They always said, "If you play music for us again."
However, there was something that bothered me.
I felt that the library had some special meaning for the people of this town.
Everyone's reaction yesterday. Thinking back, Mad also changed his expression when I went to the library.
...No, I shouldn't make strange assumptions now.
I looked away from the charging battery and looked at Shiona, trying to hide the anxiety in my heart.
"I need to have Shiona sing again."
"Yeah, I'll sing with gratitude to everyone."
Shiona gives me her usual smile.
Tipi was next to Shiona.
She's looking at Shiona with a slightly bewildered expression.
Come to think of it, this is the first time I've seen these two together.
"Tipi, how long do you think it will take to charge?"
"Um... probably about thirty minutes."
"I see, that's surprisingly fast."
"Only thirty more minutes to be with Rei...?"
Tipi goes around Shiona and hugs my leg.
Her sad expression hasn't changed.
But I felt that the sadness had eased a little.
I stroke Tipi's head with the palm of my hand.
As I stroke her silky hair repeatedly, Tipi rubs her cheek against my leg.
"...Okay, you two. That's enough."
Shiona wedges herself between me and Tipi.
"Ah... Rei, Rei..."
Tipi reaches out to me, seeking me.
But her hand doesn't reach me.
"Rei, just a moment..."
Shiona grabs my arm and drags me to the wall.
– Shiona's sweet scent tickled my nose.
"Rei, Tipi-chan is a girl now. Do you understand what that means?"
"I know. She's cute and affectionate, isn't she?"
"That's not what I mean... I don't think it's good to touch her so casually or get too friendly."
"Why? I think it's fine if Tipi is happy."
"That's not it... I don't think it's good to touch girls of that age so casually."
"Even if you say 'of that age,' Tipi is still a child, right?"
"Girls mature on the inside faster than they look. She already has a pink heart."
"Pink...? What does that mean?"
"Pink is pink. That's why I don't think it's good."
Shiona seemed more flustered than usual.
She's talking to me with a smile, but her cheeks are slightly puffed out.
Come to think of it, her smile always stiffened when I said I was going to the library.
It seems Shiona doesn't like me getting along with Tipi very much.
Right now, she even looks like she's competing with Tipi.
"...Hey, Shiona. Could it be that this is the emotion called 'jealousy'?"
At my words, Shiona's eyes widened and she gasped.
She restlessly moved her gaze, avoiding looking at me.
This is the first time I've seen her make such an expression, she who always has a smile on her face.
I reach out and put my hand on Shiona's head.
"Eh? Rei...?"
And then, I gently stroked her hair like I do with Tipi.
"W-wa, Rei, what's with you all of a sudden? What's wrong?"
Shiona's hair is different from Tipi's; it's smooth and feels good. It smells nice every time I stroke it.
It's the kind of hair that makes you want to touch it forever.
"R-Rei? I feel kind of embarrassed, you know? Hey?"
"Ah, sorry. But I somehow thought it would be better to do this."
I don't really understand why, but watching Shiona right now makes my chest feel warm.
A feeling close to the joy I learned about before is welling up.
"S-so, anyway, let's try to refrain from getting too clingy, okay? Okay? Will you promise me?"
"Yeah, if that's what Shiona says, then I will."
That's why I had no choice but to say that.
We return to Tipi.
Tipi was anxiously looking up at us.
"What's wrong? Tipi, bad girl? Is that why you're both angry?"
Tipi furrows her brow sadly.
"It's okay. It's nothing."
"Really? Really, really not angry? Because Shiona's face... is red?"
"T-this is, it's different, okay? I'm not red and prickly!"
"Hmm... okay, I understand."
Tipi shed tears as if relieved.
Actually, I want to wipe away those tears with my fingertips, but Shiona would surely dislike that.
So I decided to suppress that impulse.
I turn on the projector after it finishes charging.
A low motor sound rings out, and the exhaust fan starts to spin.
The light at the top, indicating that it's preparing to start, was blinking.
It's been a while since I've seen an electric light. Both Shiona and Tipi stared at the blinking light with eyes as if looking at something rare.
"Um... where do I insert the chip..."
The cover on the side of the projector is broken and the control panel is exposed.
In the center of it, there's a place to insert the chip.
I slowly inserted the chip I received from Mad.
The projector frantically flashed a red light, trying to check the data inside.
We watched the scene while holding our breath.
After about 10 seconds, the blinking interval of the lamp shortened—and turned into a green light.
"This... means it's okay, right?"
Anxiety and excitement mixed, and my voice was strained.
"Yes, the projector is properly fixed, and the data inside is okay," she said.
Shiona's words made my chest swell with emotion. I could feel the corners of my mouth naturally rising.
I was feeling 'joy' at the sense of satisfaction of accomplishing something new.
After finishing charging the projector and confirming its operation, we were heading to Mad's shop.
Tipi said she was getting sleepy and stayed at the library.
I wanted her to see it with us, but Shiona cautioned me not to push her too hard.
"I wonder if Mad will be happy."
"Y-yes... I'm sure he'll be happy."
"I hope so. It's something that everyone in town made together. All the more so because everyone's feelings are in it."
"Y-yes... that's right."
"What's wrong, Shiona? Did something happen?"
Shiona has been somehow distant since a while ago.
"No. Nothing's wrong."
"Is that so... it feels different somehow..."
"More than that, Rei, it's cloudier than usual today, and my heart is turning gray."
Shiona muttered as she looked up at the sky.
I looked up at the sky in the same way, but I couldn't see any difference from usual.
Rather, since it's after the rain, the dust in the atmosphere has been washed away, making it somewhat easier to breathe.
"And it's humid, making me feel bumpy. So, Rei, why don't we relax at home today? Let's get fluffy with orange soup."
Is this atmosphere making Shiona uncomfortable...?
No, I think Shiona's words are hiding what she really wants to say.
But I didn't really understand what that meant.
I don't think Shiona would be mean.
"But, we went to the trouble of making it together. I want Mad to see his son's movie soon."
"I see... that's right."
Shiona fell silent after that.
She's not angry.
She's keeping pace with me, walking beside me.
I could see a shadow in her expression.
Arriving at Mad's shop, we stepped into the dimly lit interior.
"Hey... what do you think you're doing, barging in here?"
Mad's voice, like a rumble, came from the back of the shop.
He was leaning back in his chair, staring straight at us.
"Hello, Mad. Um... this."
I took out the patchwork projector.
Mad glared at it as if sizing it up.
"What's that? We don't buy garbage here."
"That's not it. It looks bad, but it's a projector that can play your son's movie."
"My son's movie? I don't remember asking anyone to make something like that."
"You weren't asked, it's true. I did it on my own. But various people in town cooperated to make this. I want Mad to watch the movie with everyone."
"I'm telling you, I don't remember asking for anything like that."
"I understand. I did it on my own. So what I'm going to do now, I'm going to do on my own. Stop me if you want to."
I tried to step forward.
But from behind, Shiona pulled on my sleeve, stopping me.
"Rei, Mad is prickly and purple... you should stop for today. Shall we try another day?"
"Shiona, we've come this far. Mad is saying that, but he must want to see his son's movie. If we don't see it here, we'll probably never see it."
"Besides, if he really hated it, I'd already be thrown outside."
It's just a guess based on Mad's actions so far, but I don't think I'm wrong.
"It's okay, Shiona. So don't make such a worried face. It's okay."
I nodded strongly, as if to remove Shiona's anxiety.
"...Okay, Rei. If Rei wants to, do as you please."
Shiona let go of my sleeve.
I start walking again.
I placed the device on the register counter and closed the shop door.
Next, I closed all the window curtains.
The already dark store became even darker.
It's just the right darkness for playing a movie.
Then, when I turned on the projector that I had just charged, the fan whirred and started spinning, and after a while, the attached light turned on.
A square of light floated on the wall of the shop.
I adjusted the lens I received from the photo studio manager and focused it.
Mad was just staring intently at that action.
Mad, I'm going to play the movie now. Is that okay?
......Do whatever you want.
Mad didn't deny it.
I'm convinced that's the answer Mad wants.
I placed my finger on the button on the control panel...
──Play.
Mad stared at the square of light with a stern expression.
Within the light, the story begins.
It was the story of a boy.
The stage was set in an era when the sky was still blue and nature remained.
Born in a small house in a small town, he didn't know his mother.
The father he lived with only took care of the bare minimum... it was hardly a relationship you could call family.
And as the boy grew, the gap between them deepened.
They fought whenever they met.
Every short conversation was a denial of each other.
Before long, their eyes no longer met.
The boy returned home less and less, and eventually stepped onto the path of evil.
His father punched him without a word.
His brow furrowed more deeply than usual...
The boy ran out of the house and left the town.
But that was the beginning of harsh days.
He was conveniently used and betrayed by those he thought were his friends, and his body and soul were shattered.
It was a woman who supported him.
His encounter with her would lead him to the right path.
The boy washed his hands of bad things and decided to move to a new town and start his life over.
──He had a family.
A son was born, and he believed without a doubt that he would continue to live happily with his beloved wife.
But... the woman passed away from illness.
There was no time to despair.
He worked desperately to raise the child he had left behind.
However, he was so desperate to work that he didn't realize that a gap was forming in his relationship with his child.
They were always fighting when they opened their mouths.
Days of misunderstanding continued.
And the grown-up child stepped onto the path of evil, as if to spite him...
I thought it was punishment.
Isn't this exactly what I did to my father?
Now, I curse my immature self.
He thought about how to stop his son and looked at his hands.
If I open my hand, I might be able to gently persuade my son with the kindness of a caress and an embrace.
If I clench my fist, it will become a weapon, and I might be able to admonish my son with severity.
As a father, which should I choose?
──He clenched his fist.
The fist that struck his son was hot, his chest ached as if it were being tightened... and deep wrinkles were etched between his eyebrows.
But his son, holding his red and swollen cheek, shed tears.
He had been properly scolded, and he was loved... or so he thought.
Hearing those words, he also shed tears.
Why couldn't I have realized what my son had realized back then?
The face of my father after he hit me wasn't one of anger, but of sorrow.
He took his son and returned to the town where he was born for the first time in 20 years.
The townscape was almost unchanged from when he ran away.
And the small family home, as expected, remained unchanged.
But his father, who lived alone in that house, looked a size smaller than he remembered, perhaps due to old age.
He stood before his father, biting his lip and shedding tears.
His father silently patted him lightly on the shoulder and muttered only one word.
Mad's son's movie was a very old-fashioned human drama.
I don't know if it's interesting.
If my emotional functions were normal, I might have been able to judge.
But Mad was engrossed in the screen.
He watched the movie silently from beginning to end.
The credits finished rolling, and the screen went completely black.
It seems to be over.
Siona glanced at me before reaching for the projector's stop button.
The moment her slender fingertip was about to touch the button, I grabbed Siona's hand.
……? Rei?
Siona looked at me with a puzzled expression. But I was staring at the screen.
Because slowly, words began to appear in the center of the pitch-black screen.
The letters, probably handwritten, contained a clear "emotion."
『This movie is dedicated to my father』
The letters slowly dissolved into the darkening screen and disappeared.
This time, the movie quietly came to an end.
Silence fell around us.
Even after I turned off the power, Mad was still staring intently at the place where the screen had been.
Mad... the movie's over, you know?
A sigh was the reply to my words.
......A boring movie.
He muttered in a small voice that was unthinkable for Mad until now.
It was so boring that I got tired of holding back my yawns.
He wiped away the tears that had accumulated from holding back the yawns as if to discard them, then stood up from his chair and removed the chip from the projector.
Then he firmly gripped it in his palm and sat back down in his chair.
"...Get the hell out of here."
He said in a voice with little inflection, then closed his eyes as if pondering something.
Could it be that my son's feelings didn't get through to him in this movie?
Was it just a movie that Mad didn't care about...?
If so, what I did was──
My chest tightened, and I panicked and called out to Mad, needing to say something.
But Siona lightly tugged on my clothes, stopping me.
"Rei, it's okay."
Siona smiled, lowering the corners of her eyebrows.
"Mad just can't be honest with himself. Let's leave him alone for now, okay?"
Can't be honest...? 
In other words, everything Mad said earlier meant the opposite?
"Mad is very clear right now. He's filled with a beautiful light blue. It's thanks to Rei."
"Really...? If that's the case..."
I feel warmth deep inside my chest.
I know this feeling.
It's the emotion of "joy."
I'm happy that I could make Mad happy.
I'm overjoyed that I could be of help.
We quietly left the store so as not to disturb Mad.
Leaving the projector behind so he can watch movies again, whenever he wants.
When we went outside the store, we could faintly see orange light beyond the sky.
It was a color that seemed to reflect my feelings.
"I'm really glad Mad was happy."
"Yes, me too."
But her smile was somewhat sad.
"Huh? What is it?"
"You look kind of sad."
"Really? I'm not. Mad was happy, so my heart is full."
"Really? If you say so."
"Hey, Rei. Shall we have a feast today?"
"A feast? Why?"
"Because it's the anniversary of Rei making Mad happy."
"Anniversary... Yeah, it's an anniversary."
"Let's make orange soup and have a fluffy day today, okay?"
"Yeah, let's do that. I'll help with the cooking too."
"Thank you. I'm so happy, Rei."
Siona's hand touched mine.
Without either of us saying anything, we held hands.
Warmth is born within our joined hands.
The orange sky was soon swallowed by the encroaching darkness of night.
The next day, we decided to sing in the plaza as promised with everyone who helped us repair the projector.
Since we were going to do that anyway, I wanted Mad to listen with us, so I visited his store.
But the door remained closed.
Even though it's usually open by now, a sign reading 'CLOSED' was hung up.
The store door was also locked, preventing us from entering.
I peeked inside the store through the gap in the door.
The projector was left on the counter as is.
Nothing has changed since yesterday.
The chair where Mad was sitting was blocked from view by the shelf.
“I wonder what's wrong, Mad. Could he be feeling unwell?”
“...I knew it would turn out like this.”
“Turn out like this...? What do you mean?”
I tilted my head at Siona, who spoke as if she knew the store would be closed.
“From the middle of yesterday's movie, the spiky, red aura around Mad disappeared.”
“Spiky, red aura...?”
“Yeah, I think he didn't need to hold back anymore. It was the first time I'd ever seen Mad so calm.”
Siona smiled with a troubled look.
“Mad had been holding something back all this time?”
“That's right. He really wanted to reconcile with his son. He wanted to fly to his son's side. But Mad is always red and prickly, right? So there was never an opportunity.”
“Then, could it be that yesterday's movie...?”
“That's right. Because Rei showed Mad his son's movie, Mad was able to be honest with himself.”
“...Could it be that Mad went to see his son?”
“Yeah. I think he left town.”
Siona smiled brightly. Seeing that smile, I truly realized that I had been able to help Mad.
My chest suddenly felt hot, and it turned into words that came out of my mouth.
“Amazing! That's amazing, Siona! It's just like that movie! It's the father who went to see his son instead of the son, but it's almost exactly like the movie!”
“Yes, it is. It's really amazing. But there's just one thing that's troubling me.”
“Troubling you?”
Siona's expression clouded over, and she let out a small sigh.
Even though Mad and his son are reconciling, what could be troubling her?
“I think Mad won't be back for a while, so we won't be able to get the ingredients for the orange fluffy soup.”
Siona said that with a serious face.
“That's...troubling, isn't it.”
“Yeah, it's troubling, isn't it? But if we save the ingredients we have now, we should be okay for a while.”
Siona broke her tight-lipped expression and smiled.
Looking at her, I felt my cheeks naturally move.
A warm feeling welled up from deep inside my chest.
I don't know what to call this feeling, but I feel very fulfilled.
“I hope Mad comes back soon. I really want to hear his story. Maybe his son will come with him, too. That would be even better.”
“Yes, I hope so too.”
Little by little, I'm able to learn about emotions. I was really feeling that.
I'm able to get closer to the image I aspire to be.
More and more, I want to be helpful to people.
More and more, I want to learn about many emotions.
That feeling has become my greatest driving force.
“Let's go soon, Rei. It's getting late.”
“That's right. Let's hurry. I wonder how many people we can make smile today.”
“I'm sure it will be a lot. Even more than yesterday.”
“That's because Siona's singing voice is beautiful.”
“No, it's because of Rei's playing.”
“Even though you say playing, I'm just turning the handle.”
“That's what's important. When the heart of the person turning it is kind, the music becomes warm and spreads out softly.”
Siona smiles as she gently spreads her hands.
“If it were just my singing, I'm sure no one would stop. My singing is only possible because of Rei's playing. Thank you, Rei.”
My face suddenly feels hot.
“What is it, Siona? My face is really hot.”
“Really? Your face is completely red. You must be embarrassed.”
“Embarrassed? Is this the emotion of embarrassment?”
“Yeah, Rei, you're surprisingly shy. It's cute.”
My face became even hotter after hearing Siona's words.
After leaving Mad's store, we visited the plaza.
There were already many people gathered there before we arrived.
“We've been waiting for you two, thanks again today!”
“My child has been saying 'Let's go listen to the songs' since yesterday. Please do your best.”
“Your songs are healing. Thank you very much.”
“Big brother, big sister, please sing again!”
Everyone we met was waiting for our melody.
And everyone had a smile on their face.
This was it.
This is what I was looking for.
Doing something, being appreciated by people, and being thanked.
This is what I wanted.
What a great feeling.
How warm my heart is.
I wanted to experience this feeling forever.
“Siona, let's start. Let's make everyone smile.”
“Yes, of course.”
I turned the handle of the music box just like yesterday.
The melody overflows.
Siona weaves a melody to match the sound.
And that melody spreads a large circle of smiles.
Smiles spread throughout the town.
That made me happier than anything.
And Siona's smiling face as she sang was my joy.
The townspeople listened with smiles, just like yesterday.
The circle of smiles widens.
Suddenly—I felt a slight discomfort in the hand turning the music box handle.
My right hand, wearing a glove to hide the mechanical hand.
I feel a slight creak in the hand turning the handle.
“Hey, how was that machine from the other day?”
While cleaning up after the performance, I was spoken to and raised my head.
There was the director and the townspeople who provided the parts.
“It was able to play, and Mad was happy. It's all thanks to you.”
“I see, that's good. It was worth calling out to everyone.”
“It's really thanks to everyone, thank you.”
“No, it's nothing... but you know, it's all thanks to your power.”
“Oh, that's right. Because of your actions, people came forward to help.”
“But that's because everyone is kind. My actions are just a trigger.”
“Of course, that's also true. But you won't know unless you take action, and things won't change. It's not about who's the greatest or who's amazing. The person who acted first has that much value.”
The director and the people who cooperated all had warm smiles on their faces.
“If anything happens again, don't hesitate to tell us. We'll cooperate as much as we can.”
The director and the others said that and scattered away.
Watching them leave, I think.
“Hey, Siona.”
“What's wrong, Rei?”
“I still want to make more people happy.”
“Being able to make people happy is really wonderful.”
“Yes, it is. But being able to think that way is wonderful, Rei.”
I felt a little happy being praised by Siona.
I can feel the warmth spreading deep inside my chest.
“That's why I want to help and be useful to various people. I want to meet more and more people and help solve their problems and troubles.”
“If that's what Rei wants to do, I think it's a good idea.”
“Then Siona, let's go look! Let's go help the people in this town who are in trouble!”
“...wait.”
“You know, Rei, I think that's a little different.”
I was sure Siona would agree.
But she's shaking her head with a troubled look.
“It's certainly wonderful to help people. But, I think it's wrong to force it on them.”
"Force it...? I don't mean anything like that?"
"Of course, I understand how you feel, Rei. But, people have walls and problems that they have to overcome on their own. If you help them with everything, they won't be able to grow. Of course, it's important to help them, but first, they need to try their best, and only when they can't handle it on their own do they need help. So, Rei, let's help someone when they ask for help. It's not too late to help then."
I understood what Siona was saying.
I was able to understand it.
But deep down, I felt like something was bothering me.
Why should I keep my desire to help people to myself?
Why shouldn't I help people on my own initiative?
Why, why, why...
Then I stopped thinking.
Because Siona's smile seemed somehow sad.
A few days later.
The discomfort came back again.
It was the discomfort in my right hand that I had felt when turning the music box.
A sensation so small that I couldn't put it into words.
But it was definitely attacking my right hand.
The discomfort was gradually increasing.
After returning to Siona's house, I tried moving my fingertips one by one in my room.
Then, all of my fingers, when bent to a certain depth, would not bend any further.
I can't grab anything with this.
This is a problem that will interfere with my daily life.
No matter how many times I tried, the problem didn't get fixed.
Maybe I need a fundamental repair, like disassembling it once.
I have an idea about the cause of this problem.
It was when I was looking for that projector.
I was quite reckless in that junkyard.
I felt the discomfort when I was moving heavy things.
I'll go to that abandoned factory later today.
And I'll go look for tools for repair.
"Rei, it's time for dinner."
Siona suddenly comes into the room.
I hurriedly put on my gloves and hid my exposed right hand.
"What's wrong? Why are you in such a hurry?"
"It's nothing. I was just spacing out, so I was just surprised."
"Did I startle you? I'm sorry. I'll knock from now on."
"Yeah, thank you. I'd appreciate that."
"Okay, I understand. So, dinner's ready, do you want to eat now?"
I look at the clock.
Before I knew it, the hands of the clock had passed the top.
"It's already this late..."
"It's been cloudy outside all the time. You lose track of time, don't you?"
"Yeah, I'll be there soon. Will you wait for me?"
"Yes, I understand. I'll be waiting in the kitchen, Rei."
Siona smiled brightly and left the room.
I took off my gloves again and checked my right hand.
...I have to somehow keep Siona from finding out.
Even if I go to the abandoned factory, it will be after I eat.
I steeled myself and headed to the kitchen.
In the kitchen, Siona's homemade dishes were lined up.
"Rei, have a seat. Let's eat."
Siona put her hands together in front of her face.
I put my hands together in the same way.
"Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil."
These words that Siona taught me.
Before I knew it, I had started offering the same prayer.
That's how much time I've spent with Siona.
Thinking that, the depths of my heart naturally warmed.
"Huh? It's nothing, really."
"Is that so? You have a happy look on your face? You're all glowy and orange."
"A happy look? I am...?"
"Yes, very, very much so. Rei, you've been making that expression a lot lately. It makes me happy too."
"Does that mean I'm 'smiling'?"
"Yes, that's right. You didn't smile at all at first, but you've been smiling a lot lately. I'm happy."
"I'm... smiling...?"
I remember the first day I woke up.
That day, the face I saw was expressionless.
From that day on, I kept wishing.
I want emotions.
Before I knew it, I seemed to be starting to get what I wanted.
I felt relieved, and the depths of my heart lightened.
Now I can be with Siona and the others forever.
I looked down at my right hand.
With this hand, hanging limply and weakly, I can't even use a spoon properly.
I reluctantly switched to my left hand and scooped up the soup.
Eating with my unfamiliar left hand was extremely difficult.
"What's wrong, Rei...? Huh, Rei, are you left-handed?"
"No... I'm right-handed, but my right hand is kind of sore today."
"It's sore? That's terrible! I have to call a doctor... Ah, but there aren't any in this town, so I have to call one from a town far away..."
"No, it's okay. It'll get better if I leave it alone."
This is bad... this is bad.
If a doctor sees me, my true identity will be revealed.
I have to avoid that at all costs.
I want to stay here forever.
"It must be because you overdid it the other day. Working so hard in the rain..."
"...Yeah, I think that's probably it."
"See, you didn't stop when I told you to. I'm worried about your body, Rei."
"Yeah, thanks. But thanks to that hard work, Mad was happy, so it was worth it."
"Yes, that's true. But don't push yourself too hard."
Siona looks at me with a worried expression.
I shouldn't do anything that makes her make that face again.
Seeing Siona with any expression other than a smile makes my heart turn blue.
"Speaking of which, I wonder if Mad is back yet. Have you heard from him since then?"
"Not yet. His son lives a little far away. I'm sure he hasn't arrived yet."
"I see. I hope he gets in touch soon."
"Yeah, I hope so too."
After that, Siona didn't ask me about my right hand.
I finished my meal quickly with my unfamiliar left hand.
Then I returned to my room and started getting ready.
I packed my tools into my bag.
I'll probably end up disassembling my own arm.
I need to solve this on my own.
I can't rely on anyone.
That's why I made thorough preparations.
As I was concentrating on the preparations, I heard a knock on the door.
Immediately after, Shiona came into the room.
"Ray, I was wondering if you wanted to go shopping... Are you going somewhere?"
Shiona asked, looking back and forth between the bag and me.
"Yeah. I'm looking for something."
"Where are you going? Is it close? Far? When will you be back?"
"I'm going to the abandoned factory. I'm planning to come back as soon as possible."
"Abandoned factory? What are you going there for?"
"Well... actually, the photography studio manager asked me for some parts, and I'm going to look for them."
That was a lie.
It was a clumsy lie, but Shiona smiled at me.
"I see... I understand. Please be really careful, okay? Your right hand isn't in good shape as it is, right?"
"Yeah, thank you. I'll try to get back as soon as possible."
I was seen off by Shiona and left the church.
My destination was the abandoned factory--.
But there was a place I had to stop by before that.
I needed to cover up the lie I had blurted out.
If Shiona happened to meet the manager and talked about me, the lie would be exposed.
If that happened, I would end up hurting Shiona.
I don't want to hurt Shiona.
That's why my feet were headed to the photography studio.
"Oh, a rare customer," the manager said.
When I opened the door, the manager, who was polishing a camera, greeted me.
"I'm sorry for intruding so suddenly."
"No, it's fine... I was just about to go home."
"Home... to the church? Did you have some business there?"
"Ah, please wait here for a moment."
The manager went to the back.
While waiting, I decided to look around at the photos on display.
There were various photos displayed, from old ones to recent ones.
The years they were taken, the locations, and the people were different.
But there was one thing they all had in common.
That was that everyone had a smile on their face.
I couldn't help but envy the people in those smiling photos.
"Well, sorry to keep you waiting. Here, this is it."
The manager held out a photo to me.
In it was a smiling Shiona and a expressionless me.
"It's a photo I took a while ago. It took some time to develop. I apologize for the delay."
"That's not true. Thank you. But, I don't have any money..."
"It's alright. It was late, and I wanted to take it. I'll make it a service."
"Thank you very much. I'll give it to Shiona."
"Please do. Still, looking at it like this, you really do resemble Shiona's older brother."
"You know about Shiona's older brother?"
"Ah, of course. Have you ever seen a picture of Shiona and her brother together?"
"Yes, I have. The one with them holding a music box, right?"
"Ah, that's the one. Actually, I took that picture."
"Is that so...? When did her brother leave on his journey?"
"It was probably right after I took that picture. He said he was going to spread music all over the world. Shiona was so sad. She's always smiling like that, but she was crying the whole time then."
"Shiona was? I can't believe it..."
"...But, recently, she's been smiling a lot more. As much as when her brother was around... No, maybe even more."
"Is that so? I think she's always smiling, for sure."
"I'm sure it's because you're here."
"I think it's partly because I look like her brother, but I don't think that's all there is to it."
"But I haven't been able to do anything for Shiona."
"Smiling isn't just about doing something for someone. You can make them smile just by being near them, by being by their side."
"Being by her side... Then I'm confident I can be by Shiona's side more than anyone."
"I can see that too. Shiona seems to show a genuine smile when she's with you."
Those words warmed my heart.
I am connected to Shiona's smile.
Because I'm here, Shiona is--.
"It's strange for me to ask, but will you stay close to Shiona forever?"
"Of course. I'll always, always be by Shiona's side and keep her smiling. That's my greatest wish."
"Hahaha, it's like a proposal. It's a shame Shiona isn't here to see this."
"A pro...posal...?"
Hearing those words, I felt my face getting hot.
I know what the word means.
It's a word for when human men and women pledge to spend their lives together.
Was what I just said the same as that?
Thinking about it, my face gets even hotter.
I turn my back to the manager so he won't notice my agitation.
"Um, well, I have somewhere to go."
"Is that so? Don't lose that photo, now."
"Yes, thank you very much."
I said my thanks over my shoulder and left the photography studio.
The road to the abandoned factory.
I pushed forward across the reddish-black earth.
The bag filled with tools was a heavy burden.
I could hear the tools rubbing against each other in the bag slung over my shoulder.
The wind is strong, and it looks like it's about to rain.
It would be self-defeating if I went to fix it and ended up with more things broken.
I decided to hurry to the abandoned factory before it started raining.
On the way there.
In the distance, I spotted something white and shimmering.
However, the location was too far away, and there was no way to confirm what that object was.
I still couldn't tell how big it was, but that white object seemed to be slowly approaching me.
I tried to strain my eyes and confirm it.
At that moment, a gust of wind blew.
I couldn't help but close my eyes.
When I opened my eyes again, the white object had disappeared from sight.
What on earth was that just now...?
I stood there for a while, dumbfounded.
But, I can't stay like this.
The clouds are getting more and more ominous.
I have to get to the abandoned factory quickly.
Just as the dark clouds made it look like it was about to rain, I arrived at the abandoned factory.
The inside is still dusty as ever, filled with the smell of oxidized oil.
Immediately, I found a workbench nearby, and I decided to remove the glove on my right hand.
I'm used to the exposed parts now.
First, I'll try slowly opening and closing my fingers.
The malfunction wasn't fixed, and the movement stopped halfway.
What could be the cause?
I took out a light from my bag and shone it on the arm area, peering inside.
It doesn't seem like there's any foreign object caught in there.
...In that case, it must be a problem with the internal parts themselves.
I took out a tool and started disassembling my right hand.
I felt a sense of unease at disassembling my own hand.
I am now destroying myself.
If I were to disassemble all of this, would I break down?
Would that be my 'death'?
I wonder, what kind of feeling would that be?
If I died, where would this consciousness disappear to?
And if it were reassembled again, would this consciousness return?
Could that be called being alive?
While thinking about such things in the back of my mind as I disassembled it, I arrived at the cause of the malfunction.
The piston rod of the cylinder that distributes oil to the fingers was bent, and oil was seeping out.
It's a part I removed once when I fixed Shiona's music box.
At that time, I used the oil inside the cylinder to help the gears of the music box mesh together.
It was only a small amount of oil, but it must have been a necessary amount for the intricately moving prosthetic finger.
So, even small flaws, when accumulated, can become a large wound.
However, with the rod bent this far, even if I fix it halfway, the oil leak might recur.
The most certain solution would be to replace this part entirely with a new one.
I stood up and decided to search around.
Phyloid parts, half-finished, were scattered on the floor.
Being here at the Phyloid factory, there must be parts lying around that fit my model.
With my right arm disassembled, I searched inside the factory.
There were many arm, leg, and torso parts scattered around inside the factory.
The head parts are so precisely made that you might mistake them for real ones for a moment if you're not careful.
I searched among them for something that would fit me.
Looking at my exposed right arm, I checked the model number of the part I needed.
That seems to be the model number of the necessary part.
I searched the scattered arm parts for the same model number.
Am I using something that's particularly rare?
Even after searching through all the parts scattered around the factory, there wasn't one with the same model number.
The state of decay in this factory is much more advanced compared to the place where I woke up.
I can tell that this facility was abandoned a long, long time ago.
In that case, it's understandable that the manufacturing dates are different, and there aren't any parts with the same model number.
While feeling impatient, I continued to search for parts and discovered something marked 'AR115'.
Its appearance is as close as possible to the shape of the part that was embedded in my arm.
However, the piston rod and shaft portion are a bit longer.
If that's the case, I should be able to replace it with just a little bit of processing.
I placed the arm with the 'AR115' attached on the workbench and disassembled it.
After successfully removing the part, I compared it to the part that was originally embedded in me—'HR114'.
It seems that an output terminal that didn't exist in 'HR114' has been added to 'AR115'.
There are no other changes.
I immediately tried attaching that part to my arm.
Unlike when disassembling, the attaching work was a bit difficult.
While dropping the screws many times, I somehow managed to finish the attachment.
When I moved my fingers, I was able to open and close them as before.
However, each time, a dissonant noise of machines rubbing against each other echoed around.
It seems the lubricant has run out.
Seeking oil, I proceeded deeper into the factory.
When the smell of oxidized oil became stronger, I arrived at a dark black drum.
When I opened them, they were all oxidized and unusable.
But at the very back, I found a relatively new drum.
When I opened it, there was a small amount of oil inside with little oxidation.
I scooped out the oil with the oil storage tank installed inside my arm.
Then, I returned the tank to its original location.
After a while, the oil was automatically extracted, improving the smoothness of the mechanical parts.
When I moved them, I could open and close my fingers without any dissonant sounds.
I was able to fix it.
Looking at my fingertips moving smoothly, I felt a sense of clarity spreading through my heart.
I put my gloves back on, returned the tools to my bag, and left the factory.
Outside, the wind had become quite strong.
I hope it doesn't rain...
I hurried back to town.
—On the way.
A white object had fallen to the ground.
It fluttered as if being toyed with by the raging wind.
After staring at it for a while, I realized it was a cloak.
With the umpteenth flutter, I could see something wrapped inside.
It had the shape of a person.
Could it be? I rushed over to it, knelt down on one knee, and gently lifted the cloak.
There was a young man with severe injuries.
Blood flowing from his wounded arm—I immediately knew he was a human.
"A-Are you alright!?"
"Ugh... ugh..."
The young man groaned in response to my voice.
His body was painfully injured, and he didn't seem to be in a condition to stand up.
There were traces near the young man's feet, as if he had crawled there.
Blood was stuck to the traces, telling the story of his ordeal.
I have to help him.
Something like a sense of mission permeated my entire body from within my chest.
"Please hang in there, are you alright!"
I threw the bag I had on my shoulder to the ground and helped the young man up.
Perhaps the pain ran through him as I shook his body, as the young man showed a look of agony and groaned even more strongly.
And he reached out his hand as if clinging to something.
I reflexively held out my right hand, which was open.
My mechanical hand was grasped through the glove.
I inwardly regretted it—I bit my lip.
But the strength in his hand was so weak that I couldn't shake it off.
The young man slowly opened his eyes and looked at me.
"Y-You... y-you..."
"A-Are you alright? There's a town nearby. I'll carry you there right away."
"T-Town..."
He muttered in a vacant gaze, as if echoing my words.
And, as if confirming the hand he was holding, he traced the glove with his powerless fingers.
I'm sure he's realized it.
He must have noticed the hard sensation, different from that of a human, through the glove.
But it doesn't matter.
This isn't a situation where I can worry about such things.
"...t-to that town...are you...l-living...?"
"T-Town...live..."
The young man repeats "town" like a mantra.
His words are weak, as if they're about to disappear at any moment.
I decided to take the young man back with me.
Maybe I can help this person now.
I put his arm over my shoulder and drag him along.
His steps are heavy, and it takes a considerable amount of time to advance even ten meters.
But I wanted to help this person...I was filled with the desire to save him.
"You...since when, town...in?"
The man, who looks like he's about to faint at any moment, asks me.
"It's only been about a week."
"I see...I...see..."
I can feel the young man weakening over my shoulder.
If I don't keep him conscious, he might not come back.
"Please hang in there, we'll be in town soon, very soon. It's not that big, but the people in town are all warm."
I desperately try to talk to the young man.
If I can talk about something that interests him even a little, he won't lose consciousness.
"There's no doctor, but there are books, so I'm sure we can find a way to treat your injuries."
"...b-book...?"
"Yes! We have everything. We can definitely look up anything. So please hang in there."
"...e-every...thing...?"
"Yes! Definitely!"
The young man takes a long, deep breath and mutters softly.
"...Abandon me..."
I didn't understand what he said.
I couldn't help but stop walking.
"...Me...leave me...as I am..."
"T-There's no way I can do that!"
"I was...attacked by humans..."
"By humans...?"
"I was just...just traveling in search of ideals...but ideals are...values..."
The young man takes another long breath.
"Because of differences in values...humans...confront each other, oppose each other, fight...becoming cruel and...violent beyond measure..."
"T-That's not true, humans are warm, they can share many things, and support each other."
"Ah, that is precisely the ideal..."
The young man relaxes, as if exhaling all the breath he had taken in.
"...U-Um, please hang in there! Please hang in there!"
Was he just unconscious, or...?
Unpleasant thoughts swirled in my head.
I gritted my teeth, looked straight ahead, and started walking towards the town.
To help this person as quickly as possible.
Before I knew it, rain started to fall, hitting our backs hard.
Rainwater seeped into my gloves, but this wasn't the time to worry about that.
I frantically carried the young man into the church.
"Ray, what's... wh-who is that!?"
Shiona greeted me, looking flustered.
"This person collapsed on the way! He's seriously injured!"
"I understand. Carry him to the back."
Guided by Shiona, I carried the young man to a room with a bed.
When I laid him down on the white sheets, the rainwater and blood on his body mixed and spread into a red stain.
There was no sign of the young man regaining consciousness.
"Ray, I brought you some water."
I held the cup Shiona handed me to the young man's mouth.
I trickled a little water in.
The young man's throat pulsed as he swallowed.
Even so, he didn't regain consciousness.
Compared to when I met him, his complexion was much paler.
"Shiona, I'm going to the library! There should be medical books there!"
Shiona started to say something, then bit her lip.
I was concerned about her reaction, but this was a critical situation.
I left the room, ignoring Shiona.
And without worrying about getting wet from the rain, I ran to the library.
"Ray, what's wrong? You're soaking wet."
Perhaps surprised by my sudden entrance, Tippy stared at me with wide eyes.
Without worrying about my ragged breath, I asked.
"Tippy... are there any medical books here?"
"Y-Yes, there are."
"Please, can you take me there right away?"
"...Okay."
She must have sensed something.
Tippy immediately led me to the location.
"Is someone sick?"
On the way, Tippy asked, still facing forward.
"Yes... they're injured."
"Is it Ray? Shiona? Or...?"
"No, it's someone Tippy doesn't know. So, you don't have to look so sad."
"But... but, but..."
Large tears streamed down her cheeks.
That young man is someone Tippy doesn't know.
And yet, and yet...
To be able to shed tears for that person, Tippy is such a kind child.
"It's okay... it's okay."
I picked Tippy up and gently wrapped her in my arms.
Warm tears soaked through my clothes.
I could feel a small ache deep inside my chest.
Enduring the pain, I rummaged through the medical books.
But no matter how many books we have, we're just amateurs.
We don't even know what the symptoms are, what treatment to give, or which book is correct.
I took as many books as I could carry from the library.
Without worrying about the books getting wet, I returned to the church.
When I opened the door, a melody flowed out.
It was Shiona's singing.
Just from her singing, I could tell that this was a sacred place.
"Shiona, how is he?"
"Well... he still hasn't woken up. I've done what I can, but..."
I ran to the young man's side.
The bandages were probably Shiona's doing.
But the young man's face was even paler than before.
I roughly opened the medical books.
I flipped through the pages, searching for something I could do.
But we were far too reckless.
No matter how wonderful the medical books are, they're just bundles of paper.
There was no way we, without any skills, could save someone with medicine from the start.
We were too powerless, too small.
Shiona quietly began to sing.
Unlike usual, it was a quiet melody, like a requiem.
"...Hmm... this song..."
The young man opened his eyes to Shiona's song.
But his gaze was empty, as if he was about to disappear.
"Do you know this song?"
"Ah, it's a nostalgic song... I used to sing it often..."
The young man's gaze traced the ceiling, then turned to me and Shiona.
Suddenly, the young man's expression softened.
"...Ah, so it was here... The world I was searching for is here..."
"What do you mean? The world you were searching for, what is it...?"
The young man couldn't hear me anymore, he didn't answer my question.
He just kept speaking unilaterally.
"...A path to coexistence... A world of harmony..."
The young man finished saying that, and quietly closed his eyes.
Then he didn't twitch or move at all.
I felt something spilling out from deep within my chest.
"Hey, Shiona, why won't he open his eyes? Is he sleeping?"
"The power I had until just now is also steadily fading..."
"Hey, I wonder why... Is he tired, I wonder..."
An indescribable sense of loss hung heavily in my chest like dark clouds.
Pain ran through me as if the depths of my chest were being churned up.
Shiona hugged me from behind.
Her warmth calmed me down a little.
Naturally, I placed my hands on Shiona's hands that were wrapped around my chest.
"Shiona... I, I..."
"Rei... Let's hold a funeral for him."
"A funeral...?"
"It's like a ceremony that's held when someone dies."
"When someone dies..."
With those words, I realized.
Ah, this person has died.
"That's the only way we can mourn the dead."
I couldn't move as I listened to Shiona's words.
I couldn't process the existence of death that had appeared before my eyes.
"Well then, can you help me with the preparations?"
I could only nod briefly.
We began preparing for the funeral.
To mourn this young man whose name we didn't even know.
As we proceeded with the preparations for the ceremony, there was only one thing that bothered me.
I had left Tippy, who had been crying so much, at the library.
Was Tippy still crying?
In that dark library. All alone.
"Rei, what's wrong?"
Shiona spoke to me as my hands stopped while decorating the altar.
"Yeah... there's something I'm a little worried about."
"Something you're worried about? What is it? Is it about that man?"
"No, it's not that... It's about Tippy."
"Tippy-chan? What's wrong with Tippy-chan?"
"When I went to get the medical books, I told Tippy everything about that person. Then, Tippy started crying... And the worst part is, I left Tippy at the library."
"You turned pale and left her there."
"Yeah, that's right. That's why I thought she might still be crying..."
"...Yeah, maybe. I'm sure she's crying in the back of the library."
I could easily imagine that scene.
Thinking that, I couldn't stay still.
"Shiona, do you mind if I go check on Tippy?"
Shiona gave me a smile that looked a little sad.
"There's still a little more to do to prepare for the funeral. So, I'd be happy if you could come back soon."
"Yeah, I know. I'll be right back."
"...Okay. Be careful."
Shiona still gave me a somewhat sad smile.
I finished decorating the altar and headed to the library.
Carrying the medical books I had borrowed.
I walked through the lightly raining town with an umbrella.
The town's appearance was somehow different than usual.
Like something important was missing, lost...
I ran through the town filled with a sense of loss and hurried to the library.
The inside of the library was enveloped in silence, as if it were blocking out the sound of the rain.
--No, except for one thing.
The sound of a blue-haired girl sobbing from the back.
I followed the sound of the girl's crying and moved forward.
The girl was in her usual place.
The girl was crying while drawing a picture as usual.
"Rei... Rei..."
When Tippy recognized me, she reached out her small hands.
As if answering, I hugged her small body.
The moment I hugged her, the sound of her sobbing grew a little louder.
"Rei... what happened to that person?"
I was choked by those words.
"Hey, Rei... Rei..."
"That person... hey... hey, hey..."
My silence had become the answer.
Perhaps Tippy understood everything, she started crying loudly without holding back her sadness.
Large tears fell for that young man she had never met.
Ah, why is this?
What is this pain in my chest?
The depths of my chest are being churned up.
It occasionally hurt and wounded my chest.
Surely, it's something that overflowed from the wound in my chest.
It's overflowing from my eyes with heat.
Before I knew it, I was crying.
I was shedding tears for the death of a young man I didn't even know.
Ah, I see.
This is 'sadness'.
This is a blue emotion.
It's the emotion that Tippy always carries in her heart.
It's so painful and difficult.
Tears flow endlessly.
I don't know how to stop them.
--No, that's not right.
I didn't want to stop them.
I wanted to keep letting these overflowing hot droplets flow.
Surely these droplets are an act of healing sadness.
By washing away the sadness that has accumulated in the depths of our hearts, we maintain our sanity.
Thinking that, I felt that the weight that had been accumulating in the depths of my heart had become a little lighter.
And at the same time, I felt that the amount of overflowing tears had increased.
I cried.
We cried.
Sobbing, hugging each other, we cried.
Crying, crying, crying...
No matter how long it took, the tears never dried up.
As if sadness would never wither, the tears continued to overflow.
"Tippy, there will be a funeral soon."
"...Funeral? What... is that?"
"It's a ceremony to say goodbye to someone who has died. Shiona is preparing it now."
"Goodbye...? What is goodbye...?"
"It means we won't be able to see them anymore."
"Won't see them anymore... no!"
Tippy clung to me tightly.
Her arms were trembling slightly.
"I understand, Tippy, how you feel. But you know, I think we have to say goodbye properly because we're sad."
"Since we can't see them anymore, let's say goodbye and see them off. Otherwise, I'm sure we'll be lonely and sad..."
"Lonely... sad..."
"Yes, I'm sure we will. So let's send them off so we don't become lonely and sad... Can you do that?"
Tippy slowly pulled away from me.
She looked up at me with a face covered in tears.
"...I can. Tippy can."
"I see. That's great, Tippy."
When I stroked her head, she looked a little happy.
But those tears never stopped.
"Well then, shall we go...? Can you stand?"
"Yes... Just a moment."
Tippy stood up and took her bear plushie in her hand.
Her constant companion plushie is still in her arms.
We held hands in the rain and headed towards the church.
"Merciful Father, God, we entrust to your hands this young man who believed in your only begotten Son and finished his journey of life in the hope of eternal life."
"Take away all the burdens of this brother and sister who are leaving us, lead them to the dwelling prepared in heaven, and add them to the assembly of saints."
"May we, who are in the sorrow of separation, be supported by the hope of the resurrection promised by the Lord, and share eternal joy with the child who has been called to you."
Shiona's voice echoed through the church, which was overflowing with attendees.
No one here should have ever seen that young man.
No one here should know that young man.
Even so, everyone gathered here was mourning the young man's death.
I thought, this is the feeling of caring for others, the connection between people.
Everyone clasped their hands in front of their chests, quietly closed their eyes, and offered prayers.
Tippy and I followed suit.
Shiona's voice solemnly echoed through the church.
It sounded almost like a song she was dedicating to the young man…
After the funeral, the young man was buried in the cemetery behind the church.
For the final farewell, the townspeople approached the coffin one by one, offering words of parting.
May you have a good afterlife…
May we meet again someday…
Eternal rest…
They offered their respective words.
"Come on, Tippy."
It was our turn, and we approached the coffin.
Tippy stared intently at the coffin containing the young man.
The tears she had been showing until just before the funeral were gone, and she was just staring at the young man expressionlessly.
As if she had lost all emotion.
Just silently.
Staring intently, intently at the coffin.
Feeling uneasy at her appearance, I tried to call out to Tippy.
But an instant before I could, she opened her mouth.
She muttered in a small voice.
Several hours passed since then.
Light rarely shone through the gaps in the clouds after the rain, but today it did.
It is rare for sunlight to shine through the gray, cloudy sky.
But I wasn't captivated by the beautiful scenery.
I was worried about Tippy's expression during the funeral.
That expression was too empty to be called sadness.
I don't know what that means.
Even so, there is only one thing I think.
I want to be by her side.
I want to be by Tippy's side and talk to her.
And I want to heal that sadness for her.
That feeling grows within me.
Just as I was about to open the door to the room, Shiona stopped me.
"Yeah, I was thinking of going to Tippy's place."
"Tippy looked so sad during the funeral, I got worried."
"I see... but you know, I'm worried about you, Rei."
"Yeah. Because you have such a sad expression, Rei."
"Sad expression...?"
I touch my face with my hand.
"You can't tell that way, can you? Here, come here."
Shiona took my hand and led me to the living room, where she made me stand in front of the mirror.
"See? You have a sad look on your face, don't you?"
My face reflected in the mirror... was pale.
I understand the meaning of what Shiona always said about Tippy being "blue."
Right now, I have the same face as Tippy.
My heart is quiet, but my body feels weak, and my expression is sinking as if pulled down by gravity.
"...Yeah, it's the first time I've seen my face like this."
This is... sadness.
Even without shedding tears, when you're captured by this emotion, your expression becomes so "blue."
"Someone has died. It's only natural to have such a face."
I wonder what purpose these feelings serve in life...
Bitter... painful... heavy, aching, and cold...
I look at Shiona's expression reflected in the mirror.
But she wears a smile that seems somehow sad and fragile.
She must be putting on a brave face.
Just thinking that makes my chest ache.
"I know you care about Tippy, but I want you to take care of yourself first."
"Me... take care of myself?"
"Yes, that's right. I want Rei to cherish Rei."
"Cherish myself... I've never really thought about that."
"Rei, you're so kind. That's why you probably put others before yourself."
"But that's what I want to do."
"It makes me a little sad. I don't want you to push yourself too hard."
"I'm not pushing myself."
"Really? I can't say I agree."
Shiona's arms entwine with mine.
"...I'm worried, you know."
I can feel my heart rate increasing.
I don't know what it is.
But it's definitely stirring my emotions.
I feel kindness in her warmth.
...No, more than kindness... I feel something else, a different kind of warmth than just skin contact.
"Hey Rei, how about some tea?"
"...Tea? Why?"
"When you drink something warm and fuzzy, your heart feels fuzzy too. It's so relaxing and feels great for both your mind and body."
"But Tippy..."
"Tippy is probably shaken up by the death. But I'm sure she can overcome it. Let's give her some space for that. Being alone is very important, you know?"
"Do you think so?"
"Yes, I'm sure of it. Because you can't become strong otherwise."
"People become stronger by overcoming walls and sorrows. But if someone helps them every time, they can't really grow. Let's leave Tippy alone today so she can grow, okay?"
Tippy is a weak person.
She's always crying.
But if this is a chance for her to grow...
I'll accept it.
"Shiona, will you make some tea?"
"Of course. Can you sit and wait on the couch?"
I sat on the sofa and waited for Shiona's tea.
After waiting for a while, a pleasant aroma filled the room.
"Sorry to keep you waiting. Here's a special, heartwarming tea. Enjoy."
The offered teacup was filled with an orange-colored liquid.
A faint sourness and a subtle sweetness waft through the air.
Like this. It's been a while since I've had a chance to talk with you slowly, Rei.
Yeah, it has. So much has happened...
Rei, how's your memory?
Um, it doesn't seem like it's coming back yet.
I see... But there's no need to rush. You might suddenly remember something.
Yeah, thanks... but, I feel bad.
Feel bad? About what?
I'm staying here, but I don't feel like I'm repaying Shiona for her kindness at all.
That's not true. I'm just happy to have you by my side, Rei.
But that's not repaying you at all.
It's not just that. You fixed my music box... and thanks to that, I can sing.
But you were singing before that, Shiona.
But it's very different with and without a melody. Remember when we played together in the plaza? Actually, I've sung in that place many times.
In that place... alone?
Yeah. But no one would listen to me back then.
Even with such a lovely voice? That's strange.
Hehe, thank you. But that's just how it is. So, I was so happy when you brought the music box with you, Rei.
That... I was just playing the music box.
That's what makes me happy. Having you next to me is what makes me happiest.
I feel the same way. I'm happy to be with you, Shiona.
...Hehe. Thank you. Rei, you've become so much more emotional.
Emotional? Me?
Yes. Your expressions are so much richer than when we first met.
That's what I've been seeking, what I've wanted.
It's what I've been longing for ever since I woke up.
Hearing you say that, Shiona, fills my heart.
The incomplete me is getting closer to being human... closer to Shiona, because that's what she told me.
That's probably because Shiona is always smiling next to me.
Do you think so? I haven't done anything.
No, it's because you're here, Shiona. Thank you, I'm grateful.
If you're going to say that, then so am I. Thank you, Rei.
I'm more thankful.
I am more... Hehe, that's funny. For the two of us to keep thanking each other.
You're right. What are we even doing?
...But you know, it's strange.
What's strange?
I'm thinking that I wish this time could last forever... that's strange, isn't it?
...No, not at all. I was thinking the same thing...
...Can I come over there?
Shiona sits next to me.
A distance where I can feel her warmth.
We are closer than we've ever been.
Huh...? What's this...?
What's wrong?
Something feels strange in my body. My chest... it's pounding.
Could it be that I'm malfunctioning? I'd be troubled if it's a major malfunction requiring maintenance.
It's okay. I feel the same way. My chest has been pounding this whole time.
Huh? A-Are you okay? Does it hurt?
Yeah. It's a wonderful thing.
Shiona gently smiles shyly and places her hand on mine.
Softly, as if enveloping it.
I respond by turning my wrist, as if to align our palms... as if to intertwine our fingers.
I feel Shiona's warmth even more strongly.
And that warmth warms the depths of my heart.
The depths of my heart are warm, like a gentle heat...
My heart...? Here...?
Shiona's hand reaches for my chest.
The place she touched instantly became hot.
Shiona's hand feels so hot... I wonder why. Could it be a disease?
No, that's not it.
Do you know the cause, Shiona?
Yes, I think so.
Tell me.
Hehe, what should I do?
Don't be mean. I'm curious.
Hmm... but you know, this isn't just happening to you, Rei.
The getting hot?
Yes, that's right. My heart is also very hot right now.
You feel the same, Shiona?
Yeah, the same. Maybe I'm even more seriously ill than you are.
That's terrible! How can we cure it?
No, we can't cure it... and we don't need to cure it.
My heart is hot, tight, painful, sad, but warm... and that's okay. That's good, Rei.
Shiona's hand on mine became a little hotter.
I squeeze her hand back.
Rei, please.
I want you to stay with me forever.
Yeah... will you stay with me forever and ever?
Yeah... I promise.
Thank you, Rei. I'm so happy... so, so...
Shiona rested her head on my chest.
And I felt like my heart was filling up.
It's similar to the feeling of joy I felt before, but even stronger.
What do humans call this?
I wanted to ask Shiona, but I thought it would be impolite to break this atmosphere.
So, I just... entrust myself to Shiona and time, as is.
The sweet-smelling tea prepared on the table. We stayed like that until the steam disappeared.
The next day, I was getting ready to go out after finishing breakfast.
Shiona, who was washing the dishes, called out to me.
I was thinking of going to the library.
The library... are you going to see Tippy?
Yeah, that's the plan.
I'm sure Tippy is still in the process of overcoming it. So, shouldn't we leave her alone?
Yeah... but if she's unable to overcome it and feeling lonely all by herself, I can't help but feel like I can't leave her alone.
Just like Shiona was by my side yesterday and made me feel warm, I think I can support her just by being nearby.
It's okay. Tippy isn't that weak.
Do you think so...?
Yeah, I'm sure of it. More than that, Rei, I have a favor to ask. Won't you go to the plaza today?
To the plaza? Why?
With the music box... I was thinking of singing again.
Yeah, you had something sad happen. So, it's important to rest your heart, you know.
Rest my heart...?
We had a funeral, and I think the townspeople are probably feeling down too. So, don't you want to brighten everyone's spirits?
...Everyone in town? Of course, I do.
It's painful to see sad faces.
If I can, I want to heal that sadness.
That's what our melody can do. I'm sure it will help the town regain its energy.
I see... do you think so?
Yeah, I'm sure of it. Come on, let's get ready.
Urged by Shiona, I reach for the music box.
The music box, which I maintain every day, is always ready to play music.
We set off for the plaza.
A cloudy afternoon.
There were hardly any people there.
There's no one here, Shiona.
It's always like this at this time. Before you came, Rei.
Before I came...?
I told you. After you started playing music, everyone started listening to my songs. The townspeople are gradually changing. They're going out more, and there's more interaction. I feel like the connection between people is getting stronger little by little.
Because I came... is that it?
Yes, I think so. After you came, Rei, the townspeople started to change. In a good way, of course.
That was a very happy thing to hear.
I'm being useful to someone.
That fact makes my joy unstoppable.
Rei, you look happy.
Yeah. Your cheeks are relaxed.
My cheeks?
Yeah, look--
Shiona's fingertip touches my cheek.
Just that makes me feel a warmth deep inside my chest again.
My face feels kind of hot.
Rei, are you blushing? Ahaha.
My face gets even hotter.
It seems Shiona is right on the mark.
Well then, Rei, shall we begin?
Yeah, is the preparation okay?
Whenever you're ready.
Shiona slowly closes her eyes.
I felt like I wanted to keep looking at her beautiful profile forever.
But just as much, I also want to hear Shiona's singing voice.
So, I slowly started turning the handle of the music box.
Shiona's singing voice rides on that melody.
The two melodies melted together, and a beautiful tone echoed around the area.
Soon, people start to gather.
At first, the people had slightly dark faces, but gradually they began to regain their smiles.
And before I knew it, a large circle of smiles had spread across the plaza.
Town Child A
Town Person A
Town Person B
Town Person C
Town Person D
The smiles and words of various people are flying around.
Ah, this is it.
This is what I was looking for.
People with happy smiles.
Each time I see those smiles, my joy is amplified.
I was saddened that that girl wasn't in that circle.
The blue girl, deep in the library.
The girl who never visits here.
The girl who remains shut up in that library.
I couldn't stop thinking about that girl.
Shiona's voice brought me back to my senses.
Sorry, I was lost in thought for a bit.
I see... everyone's already gone home.
Looking around, the large circle of people had thinned out.
I seemed to have been lost in thought for a very long time.
What were you thinking about?
Hmm... no... nothing really...
Shall I guess? It's about Tippy, isn't it?
She saw right through me. So, I honestly nodded.
...Yeah, it is.
I knew it... are you really that worried?
Yeah, I'm worried. She's still such a little kid.
A little kid, huh... I guess so.
Besides, she's always all alone. There's no way she's not lonely.
But she's always been like that. She's probably used to it.
That's not true.
After all, you said it yourself, Shiona. The townspeople have changed since I came.
Yeah, that's right...
Then I want Tippy to change too. It's not right for her to be lonely.
I said what Shiona taught me, as if returning the favor.
Hearing those words, Shiona's smile clouded over slightly.
She looked towards the library, tightened her lips for a moment, then turned back to me with a smile.
Rei, shall we go home?
It's going to rain this afternoon. Come on, let's go... okay? I'll make you some fluffy white soup.
Taking Shiona's hand, I was half-forced to leave the plaza.
Then, a few hours later.
Shiona stopped me again as I was about to leave the house.
Um, I was thinking I'd like to read a book...
If it's books you want, there are a few that my brother used to read.
Not those... well, it's a genre of book that I'm sure isn't here.
What kind of genre?
Books about machines. I've become interested since I fixed Mad's the other day.
I see. I'm glad you're taking an interest in something, Rei.
Yeah, thanks. So, I'm going to the library.
Does it have to be today?
Yeah, the sooner the better. I want to read them as soon as possible.
But it's going to rain soon?
The weather doesn't matter. I'll go even if it rains.
But the books might get wet?
It's okay, I'll take a bag with me.
Hmm... then I'll go and borrow them for you.
Eh? No, it's fine, I'll go myself.
No, it's alright. I have some shopping to do anyway, so I'll go while I'm at it.
With that, Shiona returned to her room.
I wonder why.
I feel like Shiona is trying to keep me away from the library.
No, that's not it.
It would probably be more accurate to say Tippy.
I don't know what it means, but it seems like she doesn't want us to meet.
Shiona says it calmly, but I can feel her feelings.
But, I wonder why?
I'm ready, Rei. What kind of books should I borrow?
You probably wouldn't understand even if I told you, so I'll go with you.
No, it's okay. You can relax, Rei.
Then... I'd like you to borrow a book about electronic circuits.
Electronic circuits, got it. Well then, I'm off.
Shiona went out.
Waiting for several minutes.
Shiona should be out of sight by now.
I put my hand on the door leading outside.
...That's strange.
The door isn't locked.
But that door would never open.
It's as if it's bolted from the outside.
--Could it be, that's what's happening.
When Shiona left, she locked the door with a lock that can only be used from the outside, without me noticing.
That's why I can't get out of this door.
--But, why?
--For what purpose?
I returned to the living room, holding my head.
When I looked at the table, there was a piece of paper that hadn't been there before.
It was a note from Shiona.
To Rei,
I think you were surprised that it was locked.
Do you remember when I told you that a nearby town was attacked?
So, I'm locking the door as a precaution.
Please stay home.
I've prepared soup and bread for your meal.
Please warm it up and eat it.
Make sure you don't go outside.
I also heard about the humans who repeatedly loot from that deceased young man.
Perhaps those humans are coming near here.
If that's the case, it's dangerous to go outside.
I see. Shiona was worried about me.
But, if that's the case, it would be dangerous for Shiona to go outside too.
Shouldn't I, a man, have gone shopping instead?
--I can't deceive myself....
It's certainly true that there are humans who loot.
Even so, is it necessary to lock the door from the outside?
Rather, if it's locked from the outside, the key to open it is also on the outside.
Entry into the house becomes easier.
--That's strange.
If she was really wary of humans who loot, she wouldn't have sung in the plaza yesterday.
She wouldn't do something that would intentionally gather people.
If that's the case, then why?
--There's only one thing I can think of.
She locked me in.
To keep me away from Tippy.
Shiona wouldn't do something like this without thinking.
There must be a reason.
And it must be something she's doing for me.
...Could it be that something happened to Tippy?
Is she trying to keep me from finding out about it?
Something bad for me... so I won't be sad knowing about it....
I couldn't stand still.
I want to see Tippy. I want to confirm it.
A blue-haired girl crying alone in the library.
I wanted to wipe away that girl's tears.
I look around the church.
There was a window in a very high position.
I can climb up, but there's no guarantee I can get out and down safely.
But that's the only way to get out of here.
Suddenly, a white cloth caught my eye.
Curtains swaying in the wind.
There are many of them in the room, and they seem long, large, and sturdy to cover the large windows.
I take down the curtains from all the windows.
There's no sign of sunlight pouring down from the sky closed off by dark clouds.
When I tie five curtains together on the table, they become quite long.
It's long enough to reach down to the first floor.
I tied the end of the curtain to the window bars.
I wrapped it around many times and checked the strength repeatedly.
It's okay.
It should be able to support my weight alone.
I tie the other end of the curtain to myself.
And with determination, I leaned out of the window.
The ground visible from there looks very far away.
I feel a little faint, but I can't back down now.
Gripping the curtain tightly, I slowly lower my body.
Partway down, a strong wind shook me.
While my body swung like a pendulum, I did my best to cling to the curtain.
I waited several minutes for the wind to subside.
I took a deep breath and resumed lowering my body.
It probably took about ten minutes until my feet finally reached the ground.
My body was so exhausted that I almost collapsed on the spot.
But there's no time to rest here.
I started walking towards the library where the blue-haired girl is waiting.
As if to hinder my thoughts, rain quietly begins to fall.
The intensity gradually increases, as if to moisten the parched town.
Not carrying an umbrella, I continue walking without minding getting wet.
The wet clothes stuck to my skin, bringing me discomfort.
I try to shield my right hand, covered in a glove, from the rain.
Puddles began to form under my feet, and distant thunder could be heard.
My rough breaths occasionally carried rainwater into my mouth.
Cold rain beat down from the outside, in contrast to my hot body.
Spitting out the rusty-tasting rain, I finally arrived.
At the library where the blue-haired girl is waiting alone.
The inside is dimly lit, and no light is leaking out at all.
Is she buried alone in that dark sea of books again?
Just thinking about it makes my chest ache terribly.
I enter the entrance and proceed deep inside where the blue-haired girl is waiting.
"You came after all..."
A voice came from the back.
It wasn't Tippy's.
It was the very person who kept me away from here--.
"I wrote in the note that you shouldn't go outside because it's dangerous, didn't I? Maybe you didn't see it?"
"No, I saw it."
"I see... So you came knowing that. Ray is a bad boy."
I hear Shiona giggling.
But her expression is not clearly visible in the dimly lit building.
"Why did you lock me up?"
"Lock you up...? Well, I guess that's how it turned out. I'm sorry."
"There's a reason, isn't there? Would you mind telling me about it?"
"...A reason? The reason is simple. I don't want you to see her."
"You don't want me to see her...?"
"The blue-haired girl up ahead."
"Tippy? Why?"
"I can't tell you that. It's top secret."
"Wait, I don't understand what you're saying. Why can't I see Tippy?"
"That's... because it's not allowed."
"That's not a reason! Tell me properly."
"I can't tell you the reason."
I couldn't help but raise my voice.
At the same time, I noticed that the inside of my chest was burning red and hot.
Is this "anger?"
Am I feeling anger towards Shiona...?
That's not my intention. I just want her to tell me the truth.
But my words just now seemed to have upset Shiona.
I can't see her expression clearly in the dark, but the atmosphere coming from her has changed.
An air of hesitation, as if she was struggling to say something.
Shiona opened her mouth slightly, as if to say something... but then closed it again.
And then, tilting her chin as if looking down, she whispered.
"...Because you'll become unhappy."
"Unhappy? Who?"
"...Ray, me... and maybe everyone living in this town."
"The people in town? Because we meet? I don't know what you're talking about."
"Certainly, you may not understand now. But you'll surely regret it later."
"Why will I regret it? Hey, Shiona, tell me clearly. I'm not very smart, so I don't understand unless you tell me clearly..."
"In other words, it's like this..."
The sound of boots.
Shiona is approaching me in the dimly lit entrance.
The next moment, what I felt was warmth.
And, softness.
Shiona was hugging me.
"Shiona... eh? W-what...?"
"Please, Ray... let's go home together like this, okay?"
"Like this...? What do you mean?"
"It's really not good for Ray and Tippy-chan to meet. To be precise, bad things will happen in a chain reaction if you meet. So..."
"Could it be that I made Tippy angry? Is that why she doesn't want to see me, or something?"
"No, it's the opposite. Tippy-chan loves Ray very much."
"Then--"
"That's why you can't see her. Please, understand."
Shiona's arms around my waist tightened.
A sweet fragrance enveloped my entire body, making my head spin.
"...Is that Shiona's wish?"
"Yes, it is. It's my heartfelt wish."
"If I were to meet Tippy, what would Shiona think?"
"I would be very, very sad. And I think I'd feel blue and prickly."
"Why? Why would Shiona feel that way?"
Shiona pulled her face away from me and looked up at me...
And said, as if she had made up her mind.
"Ray... because I like you."
"Li...like...?"
Those words almost made my mind stop.
Sweet breath.
Lips that were about to touch.
Hands around my waist.
Touching body heat.
We were as close as we could be.
And then, those words just now.
A word made up of just two characters, yet filled with such deep emotion.
These words are filling my chest with tremendous force.
I was feeling an unprecedented amount of "joy."
Being needed by someone. Having a certain amount of emotion poured into me by a specific someone.
I don't know any greater joy than this.
And now, I'm about to obtain that joy.
I put my limp arms around Shiona's back.
Shiona accepts it.
The warmth deep inside my chest increases.
"Shiona, I..."
"Yes, Ray. I understand. So let's go home, to our house..."
Shiona's hand is connected to mine.
I turned on my heel and started walking towards the library exit.
"...Thank you, Ray. But you know, this is for the best. This is for your sake."
Shiona's words made me feel uneasy.
Shiona called out to me with a questioning voice when I suddenly stopped walking.
"Shiona, you just said, 'For my sake,' right?"
"Yes, I certainly said that."
"That's not it, Shiona."
"Not it? What's not it, Ray?"
"If you're saying it's for my sake, then this isn't right."
"It's not wrong. Doing this is for your sake, Ray."
"It is wrong. Because I'm happy when I can be useful to someone. I'm here to be useful to someone. But now, I'm trying to disappear from the person I can be useful to. That's not my joy, and it's not for my sake. Then, who is this for?"
"Shiona, I'm going to Tippy's side. It's for no one else but myself. If someone becomes unhappy because of this, it's my fault. But even if that happens, I won't stop. Because that's the result I wanted."
Releasing Shiona's hand, I once again pushed forward into the entrance.
Shiona's voice didn't reach my back.
Shiona just silently, without saying anything, gazed at me with a sad expression.
Exiting the rain-scented entrance, I advanced deeper into the library.
I could feel the moisture on the soles of my shoes being absorbed into the carpet with each step.
The dry library air clung to my damp skin.
I continued to feel inexplicably uneasy.
That might be related to what happened with Shiona, whom I had just parted ways with.
My chest ached, as if I had swallowed something heavy.
Shiona's face flashed through my mind repeatedly.
Every time, she wore a sad smile.
Why did things turn out this way?
Why did I do such a thing?
A wave of regret washed over me.
But I couldn't afford to stop walking.
--Beyond this, that girl is there.
The girl who is always alone.
The girl who is always blue.
The girl who is always shedding tears.
I couldn't leave that girl alone.
That's why I'm walking down this hallway.
Pictures were posted on the hallway walls.
The pictures that Tippy draws, one each day.
In the pictures drawn on brand new paper, a single girl was depicted.
I immediately knew who that girl was.
A girl drawn small and alone in a large piece of paper.
Tears streamed down her cheeks.
The recent pictures all had the same composition.
A picture of a lonely girl crying.
Seeing those pictures made my chest ache terribly.
The girl had been alone all this time.
I felt like I understood her sadness.
I wanted to quickly wipe away that sadness.
I wanted to tell her that she wasn't alone.
I wanted to tell her that I was by her side.
Dragging my wet soles, I proceeded down the long hallway.
Gazing at the pictures posted at a height Tippy could reach, I continued forward.
At that moment, I suddenly felt a sense of unease.
It wasn't because of the content of the pictures.
The problem was the number of pictures.
No matter how you look at it, Tippy is a young girl.
Even if she drew a picture every day, could she really draw this many?
...Maybe there were days when she drew several pictures a day.
Even so, the number of these pictures is impossible.
Just how lonely was the girl?
Did she have nothing else to do but draw pictures?
Ah, why did I leave the girl alone?
How many tears did I make her shed because of that?
The amount of tears in the pictures of the girl increased with each passing day.
It seemed to represent the deepening of the girl's sorrow.
I hurried.
To the girl who was probably crying alone in the depths of this place.
To heal that sadness.
And to wipe away those tears.
To hold the girl... to hold her body in my arms.
I walked as quickly as I could, almost out of breath, towards the deepest part of the library.
The girl was gone from the spot where she should always be.
Her constant companion, the bear plushie she always kept close, wasn't there either.
All that remained was an unfinished drawing and crayons.
The unfinished drawing depicted a girl crying all alone.
Where could Tippy have gone?
I searched the surrounding bookshelves, but she was nowhere to be seen.
Could she be somewhere in this library?
Or perhaps outside of it?
I didn't know the truth.
I wouldn't know until I searched for Tippy.
I started walking.
Weaving through the bookshelves, I searched for the blue-haired girl.
The vast library grounds were not suitable for searching for someone.
In addition to that, it was dark.
Just looking from the edge of the bookshelf wasn't enough to find her.
I would have to check step by step with my own feet.
I walked between the bookshelves from the back of the library towards the entrance.
Before I knew it, the clothes that should have been wet were starting to dry.
And it was around the time my hair had completely dried.
That's when I finally found the girl.
The girl was on a large stepladder, arranging books on the shelf.
The girl was a resident of this library and also served as a librarian.
She was probably returning books that the townspeople had returned to their original locations.
It was a harsh thing for this little girl to do.
The thousands of bookshelves in this library were stacked to the height of the ceiling and connected.
I didn't even want to think about the number of all the books.
The girl faced such a large number of books and managed them like this every day.
All alone, inside this library.
When I thought about that, I couldn't help but feel a tightness in my chest.
Tippy stretched on the stepladder, returning books bigger than her face to the shelf.
After finishing that task and taking a breather, Tippy turned her face towards me.
"...Ray! ...W-w-w-wah..."
Tippy, noticing my presence, lost her balance on the stepladder.
"Tippy, watch out!!"
The stepladder fell.
Tippy's hand reached out.
Responding to that hand, I reached out with both of my hands.
The impact pierced through my chest to my back.
When I realized it, I was on the floor on my back, holding Tippy in my arms.
"Ray...you came, Ray...!!"
Tippy rubbed her cheek against my chest over and over.
Relieved, I stroked Tippy's head.
Her soft hair welcomed my hand.
"Tippy, does anything hurt? Are you injured?"
"I'm okay! Does anything hurt, Ray?"
"I'm fine. Thank you for your concern."
"You saved Tippy... I love you, Ray...!!"
The little girl's hands gripped my clothes tightly.
I felt a slightly wet and warm sensation on my chest.
Tippy was shedding tears.
But they seemed like different tears than usual.
Surely they were tears of relief.
I must be able to lighten Tippy's heart a little by being here.
Thinking that, joy rushed through me.
"Tippy was arranging books. I'm a good girl, right? Good girl?"
"Yes, you're a good girl. A very good girl."
"Hey, pet me. Because I'm a good girl, pet Tippy's head."
"Yes... Tippy is a good girl, a good girl..."
I stroked her silky hair.
"Yay... Ray is petting my head. Tippy is so happy..."
"Do you always arrange books?"
"Yes. I'm repairing books. Because I want lots of people to read them."
I looked up at the bookshelf.
Certainly, some of the books were quite old.
Some had worn spines, and others were discolored.
Tippy is repairing these...? 
I remembered wetting the books in the rain.
If I handle them roughly, I'll end up increasing Tippy's work like this.
I swore from the bottom of my heart to treat them with care.
I sat up and leaned my back against a nearby bookshelf.
"I'm sorry I'm late."
"It's okay... because you came, Ray."
"Were you alright by yourself?"
"No... I was very, very lonely."
"Were you crying?"
"Yes... yes, yes..."
Tippy pressed her face against my chest.
Occasionally, I could hear her sobbing.
"It's okay, I'll be with you forever now."
"Forever? Ray, will you stay with Tippy?"
"Yes, that's right. I'll try to come to the library as much as possible."
"Won't you stay with me?"
Tippy raised her face.
Large tears welled up in her eyes.
"That's a little difficult. I'm in Shiona's care right now."
"But, I'll come every day. That'll make you less lonely, right?"
"Yeah... but, the nights are really lonely."
"The nights, huh..."
"It's dark and quiet... Sometimes, Tippy thinks she might be all alone in the world."
"That's not true. That's not true..."
All I could do was hug Tippy.
Tippy had a sweet scent.
A sweet scent different from Shiona's.
"Yeah, I know... Tippy is happy just that you come here like this. Hey, Ray. Can I ask you something?"
"Yeah, what is it, Tippy?"
"Will you help me?"
"Yeah... of course, it's my pleasure."
I stood up and took Tippy's hand.
Pushing a cart filled with several books, we strolled through the library.
"Next... um, the book called 'Philosophy of Mind and Body'."
"That's on Easy 493, third shelf from the top, thirteenth book from the right."
As soon as I said the book's title, Tippy immediately said where it was.
It was as if she knew every book in this library.
In the place she mentioned, there was indeed a gap for one book.
When I put it in, it fit perfectly.
Tippy wasn't just saying things randomly.
She was pointing out the book's location with certainty.
I became interested and decided to ask a slightly mischievous question.
"Hey Tippy, can I ask you something?"
"Do you remember the opening part of this novel?"
What I handed her was a rather old novel.
Tippy stared intently at the title and began to recite as if she were opening a book in her mind.
"'Looking down, there was a height of five stories. Cream-colored bricks were laid right next to the school building, creating a walkway that would be pleasant to stroll along. There was a flower bed right next to the walkway, and you could see colorful flowers even from this height. If I were to throw myself from here, would the cream color and the flowers all be stained with my dirty blood?'"
Tippy recited it without a single mistake.
It matched the handwritten text in the novel perfectly.
"Could it be that you remember all the books here?"
"Hmm... I don't know."
"Then, what about this book?"
After glancing at the book I handed her, Tippy began to recite fluently.
"'The human body is composed of approximately 206 bones, starting from the head with the occipital bone, frontal bone, temporal bone, parietal bone, sphenoid bone, ethmoid bone, malleus, incus, stapes, inferior nasal concha, lacrimal bone, nasal bone, vomer, maxilla, palatine bone, zygomatic bone, mandible, hyoid bone, and then connecting to the cervical vertebrae, extending to the thoracic vertebrae, lumbar vertebrae, sacral vertebrae, coccygeal vertebrae, ribs, and sternum'"
"...Then what about this one?"
I handed her another handwritten book, this one titled 'The Complete Book of Pi'.
"How does this 'Soul-less Child Theory' begin?"
"'All things are finite, and even the soul is no exception. A child born after the soul has withered will be a soulless vessel. - Edward Morgue'"
Tippy has memorized all the books here.
But, why is that?
Even with tremendous memorization skills, she would first need to read all these books.
Even if she read every day, she could never finish reading this sea of books.
What on earth is going on...?
"Ray, what's wrong?"
"No, it's nothing. Come on, let's put the next book away."
There's no point in thinking about something I can't figure out.
For now, I'll focus on helping Tippy with her work.
After returning all the books to the shelves, we sat down in our usual spot.
"Ray, thank you for helping me."
Tippy is being even more affectionate than usual.
Is it a reaction to not being able to see me until now?
The way she clings to me is cute and endearing.
"It's okay, Tippy. You always do this alone, right?"
"Yeah... I'm always, always alone. I'm lonely."
"...Since when have you been alone?"
That might have been a forbidden question.
Tippy looked up at me sadly.
"Tippy has been alone for a long time."
And then, Tippy told me.
The sad story of how Tippy came to be alone.
"Papa, Mama!"
It was a story from when Tippy's parents were still in the library.
The girl loved them.
She loved her kind mother and father.
Her mother was always smiling and gently hugged Tippy.
Her father was always organizing books, gently watching the two of them.
"Tippy is still such a spoiled child."
Her father takes out a digital device for books from the desk.
"Oh, that's right. Tippy liked this one better."
With a wry smile, he puts away the electronic device and takes out a "book" made of paper instead.
The technology of printing has already become obsolete, and it is now a valuable cultural relic.
"Welcome, Tippy."
Called onto her mother's lap, she sits down happily.
And on Tippy's lap is a bear stuffed animal chosen by her parents.
Tippy enjoyed every day.
She enjoyed the days she spent with her beloved mother and father.
And there wasn't a day she didn't feel happy.
Her mother always praised Tippy's drawings.
"She's sure to be an artist someday. Your father is so proud," she'd say.
Her father always had hope for Tippy's future.
If only those days could last forever.
If only the three of them could stay together like this.
Tippy always thought so.
Before she knew it, the number of days her parents frowned increased.
Tippy didn't like that expression.
The town also seemed bustling and restless.
The adults were all talking about something, all saying the same things.
But, young Tippy didn't understand what it meant.
She only felt a rising anxiety that their life as it was would be destroyed.
One day, the phone rang.
To Tippy, the sound seemed very sad.
Her father, who answered the phone, began to frown.
That expression that Tippy didn't like.
After putting down the phone, her father was talking to her mother about something.
After a while, the conversation turned into an argument.
They were arguing about something.
The only thing she understood was that seeing the two of them arguing made her very sad.
"Tippy, will you listen to me?"
After a while, her mother looked at Tippy with a serious expression.
Behind her was her father -- and packed luggage.
Tippy intuitively realized that their life as it was would not continue.
"Right now, terrible things are happening in the world."
"Many people are scared, and they can't sleep at night. Tippy wouldn't like that, would she?"
"There are children all over the world who feel that way. Your mother wants to help them if she can."
"Yes... I knew Tippy would say that... So, Tippy, what I'm going to say next is important. Listen even if you don't understand, okay?"
"The truth is, your father and I have to go far away to help those children. Even if we go, we might not be able to change things... But, there's a possibility."
"No. Much, much farther. A faraway place that takes many days or weeks to get to."
Her father stopped Tippy as she tried to go to her room.
"Tippy doesn't need to pack for the trip."
"That's not it... Actually, Tippy, your father and mother are going to that place alone."
"Alone...? What about Tippy...?"
Her parents exchanged glances.
Tippy sensed something from her parents' sad faces.
Suddenly, tears began to overflow.
"I'm sorry, Tippy, but we can't do that."
"The place your mother and I are going is very dangerous. We don't want to take you to such a dangerous place, Tippy. Because your mother and father love you very much."
"No... I don't want to... I don't want to! Tippy's going too..."
Her parents gently hugged Tippy.
"I'm sorry, Tippy... but your mother and I still have to go."
"I'm sorry, Tippy... It's okay, we'll definitely be back soon."
"We'll be back real soon... So you won't be lonely, we'll come back right away..."
"Tippy, be a good girl and stay home. And show us your drawings again when we get back."
"Oh, that's right. Draw one picture every day. Things Tippy saw, things Tippy heard, things Tippy learned, things Tippy felt. Could you tell us about them when we get back?"
"That's right. I'll write a lot of stories on my trip, too. I'll come back to tell them to Tippy."
"Yes, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. I promise, so..."
The family of three hugged each other.
To heal the separation, the length of which was unknown--.
How much time had passed since then?
Tippy continued to draw, just as her father had told her.
She pasted each drawing on the wall as she finished it. So that her parents would see them right away when they returned.
Things she saw...
Things she heard...
Things she learned...
Things she felt...
But soon it was filled with feelings for her parents.
I want you to hug me, I want you to pat my head, I want you to call my name, quickly... I want to see you... .
Her heart was dyed blue, so blue.
The girl continued to draw, shedding tears... .
Tippy told me about her sad past, shedding blue tears of sorrow.
Her small shoulders were trembling faintly.
The girl endures the sadness in front of me.
I can't fathom how much grief that is.
Probably because I've never felt that much sadness before.
So I can't understand Tippy's feelings.
But I should be able to heal that sadness.
By holding her small body.
Surely.
Tippy sat with her back against the wall.
I reach out to her delicate body.
When I touched her shoulder, Tippy's body jumped slightly.
It wasn't rejection.
She just seemed a little surprised by the sudden action in the dark.
"It's okay, Tippy. It's okay."
"Hey, Rei, you won't disappear from Tippy's life, will you?"
"Yeah, I won't disappear."
"You won't leave Tippy alone?"
"Yeah, I won't leave you alone."
"You won't make Tippy lonely?"
"Yeah, I won't make you lonely."
"You won't make Tippy sad?"
"Yeah, I won't make you sad."
"You'll cherish Tippy?"
"Yeah, I'll cherish you."
"You'll hug Tippy?"
"Yeah, I'll hug you."
"You'll hold Tippy?"
"Yeah, I'll hold you."
"You'll pat Tippy's head?"
"Yeah, I'll pat your head."
"You'll hold Tippy's hand?"
"Yeah, I'll hold your hand."
"You'll stay with Tippy forever?"
Tippy's eyes glimmered faintly in the darkness.
The shoulder I touched was burning with feverish warmth.
I embraced Tippy--
"Oh, you two are getting along well."
The voice that echoed in the darkness didn't belong to the girl who was trying to heal her sadness.
It was Shiona, who should have parted ways with us at the entrance.
Before I knew it, Shiona was standing beside us.
With a smile that was still visible even in the dim light, Shiona approached us directly.
"But you know, getting along too well is also a problem. You're a boy and girl of that age, after all."
Shiona stopped the hand I had extended to Tippy.
"N-No..."
Tippy's face, which had been seeking that arm, twisted in sadness.
I couldn't help but raise my voice at Shiona.
"Shiona, what are you doing!"
"What's wrong? Why are you so excited? You have to consider the implications of physical contact with a child of that age."
"That's not it. Tippy is sad... I'm just trying to heal her sadness, even a little."
"Sad? About what?"
"About her parents not coming home yet! Tippy has been all alone this whole time. She's been feeling lonely all along!"
"That's reality, so it can't be helped."
"Can't be helped? What exactly does that..."
Shiona walked up to Tippy.
And looked at Tippy, who was small and grieving.
"Tippy-chan? It's sad, but Tippy-chan is all alone, you know? Always has been, and always will be."
She said that with a smile, in her usual tone.
"Shiona, what are you saying..."
"Tippy-chan knows it too, right? Your mom and dad aren't coming back anymore, are they?"
"Shiona... stop... don't say such cruel things..."
"You actually realize it, don't you? You just don't want to admit it."
"...No... no... no!"
"Tippy-chan's mom and dad..."
"...Shiona... stop..."
"Are already de──"
"STOP IIIIIIIIIT!!"
My voice echoed through the library.
My whole body was burning up.
My breathing became ragged, and I felt a pain deep in my head.
My clenched teeth were also grinding.
My vision flickered, and I could barely stand.
And at the same time, I was sure of it.
My chest felt red and prickly. The feeling Mad always had.
This is the emotion called 'anger'.
I'm feeling anger at the injustice happening before my eyes.
Now, the blue girl's hope has been cut off.
Tippy was hurt by Shiona's heartless words.
Tippy is crying with a voiceless voice.
Her face is all crumpled up.
Turning her sadness into large drops, flowing down her cheeks.
With her small body, she desperately tells the story of her bottomless sorrow.
Shiona added insult to injury.
"Because it's true, right? How long do you think it's been since Tippy-chan's mom and dad came home?"
"Tippy-chan, you draw pictures every day, right? How many is it now?"
"Stop it..."
"Doesn't it make you sad to draw every day? How many more pictures do you have to draw before your mom and dad come back?"
"Sto-op it..."
"It's useless no matter how much you cry. Tears only flow to comfort yourself. Just because they flow doesn't mean anything will change."
"...Please stop..."
"That's just self-satisfaction. You're only crying because you know someone will be nice to you if you cry. That's just running away from reality."
"...Plea...se stop..."
"It's time to realize it. Your mom and dad aren't coming back. Never again. Tippy-chan will never be able to see her mom and dad again."
"And let me tell you, Rei is only here because he pities Tippy-chan. He doesn't have the love that your mom and dad poured into Tippy-chan. Only pity is binding Rei here. Tippy-chan, do you understand? You're all alone."
"STOP ----------------"
A resounding roar.
When that voice echoing off the walls died down, only Tippy's sobs remained.
Tippy looks up at Shiona with hollow eyes.
I felt like the light she had just a little while ago had disappeared.
"Rei, coddling and comforting are different."
"That's not true... that's not true..."
"Rei, accept reality too. Tippy-chan's parents are no longer in this world."
"That's wrong... that's not true..."
"Then why haven't they contacted her even once? Not even a single letter to Tippy-chan, whom they loved and cherished so much?"
"That's... surely, they're busy and don't have time to contact her..."
"If they knew the other person was worried, they wouldn't begrudge the time. Especially if it's their beloved child. The fact that they haven't means――"
"Stop it... please stop..."
"――Tippy-chan's mom and dad are already dead."
I froze.
Shiona's tone was as gentle as usual, and her smile was the same as always.
I wish she would have said it in a cold, emotionless voice.
In that abnormal atmosphere, I couldn't continue speaking.
Shiona's face is smiling as she faces Tippy again.
"Tippy-chan, your only family is your mom and dad. But those two aren't coming back anymore. That's why no matter who you're with, you'll never be truly fulfilled. Even if Rei is with you, you can't become a family. That's an unchangeable fact. You'll always be alone."
Shiona turns on her heel and heads towards the entrance.
On the way, she turns back towards me once.
But she keeps her gaze fixed on the floor.
"Rei... it's all for you."
Shiona left the library, leaving only those words behind.
The inside of the library became quiet.
Now, even the sound of Tippy's sobs is gone.
I was enraged and exhausted by Shiona's words and actions.
I can't even stand up.
But I can't leave the girl alone like this.
The girl is probably thinking.
That she is all alone in the world.
That she has to live in solitude.
I didn't want her to think that way.
I wanted her to know that she's not alone.
The feeling I have for Tippy isn't pity.
It's definitely not pity.
I repeat it over and over again.
As if telling myself, over and over again.
I reach out my hand to Tippy's shoulder.
I pull her delicate shoulder close.
Tippy startled at first, but settled into my chest.
She presses her face against me, shedding silent tears.
I gently stroked her trembling shoulders over and over.
If only I could alleviate even a little of the sorrow she holds in that small body...
I don't know how long we stayed like that.
We sat there, nestled close to each other.
After a while, when I lost all sense of time.
Tippy wobbled to her feet and began to walk, as if searching for something.
Tippy doesn't answer.
It's her sketchbook and crayons.
Tippy returns to my side, holding the two items.
She sits down, leaning her back against my stomach.
Tippy still doesn't answer.
Instead, she flips through the pages of her sketchbook.
With a fresh page as her canvas, Tippy takes a crayon in her hand.
And without hesitation, she runs the crayon across the paper.
What she draws is a cute, age-appropriate picture.
The first thing she drew was a picture of a blue girl.
There are traces of tears on her cheeks.
Her eyes are tinged with red.
I gently stroked Tippy's head.
Lowering her gaze again, Tippy runs the crayon across the paper.
The next thing she's drawing seems to be me.
My hand is placed on the girl's head.
It seems to be a scene of me gently stroking her head.
And then――
It was Shiona.
In a slightly distant place, she's looking at the girl with a scary face.
That was Shiona as Tippy saw her.
Even from my perspective, Shiona before Tippy probably appears as she does in the picture.
Why did Shiona do such a thing?
Shiona said.
It was all for me.
I don't know what that means.
No, I didn't want to know.
I don't understand how making Tippy cry could be for my sake.
Can I be happy by making someone else unhappy?
No, there's no way that could happen.
It must never happen.
As if to erase Shiona's words that clung to my ears, I hug Tippy tightly.
Her voice is faint and seems to disappear.
But deep down, I felt a tinge of joy.
I think as I look at the picture.
Maybe this is Tippy's way of avoiding sorrow.
It is said that people dream at the end of the day.
That's said to be for organizing the memories of the day's events.
For Tippy, maybe this picture is that.
The events of the day――
Including the good and the bad, she draws everything.
By doing so, she organizes her memories and calms her heart, perhaps.
In fact, Tippy's expression is somewhat softer.
As the picture progresses, her sorrow eases.
As if she's handing over her sorrow to the picture.
Tippy, having stood up, took my hand.
Following her lead, I arrive at a wall covered in pictures.
She says she draws one picture a day.
The number of pictures was enormous.
Tippy pasted the picture she drew today at the very end.
Another picture of Tippy's has been added.
The wall full of pictures felt like a diary showing this girl's solitude.
Tippy must have spent her time alone on this story.
Such a sad story, all alone...
Thinking that, something welled up from the depths of my chest.
Looking at her sorrowful eyes, I couldn't help but choke up.
Instead of answering, I hug Tippy close.
After a while, I hear quiet, sleepy breaths.
I compare Tippy, sleeping in my arms, with the picture diary on the wall.
Maybe this picture book is Tippy's heart itself.
I fell asleep thinking about such things.
It's the church where I live.
I'm standing in front of the familiar white, large door.
I pushed open that door with both hands.
The chapel that continues inside is enveloped in surprising silence.
――No, it's not complete silence.
Because the sound of quiet sobbing reached my ears.
I rush through the chapel.
Then, I came face to face with the sobbing figure.
It was a person who always had a smile on her face.
It was Shiona.
Shiona is crying, her delicate shoulders trembling.
I couldn't hide my surprise at that.
――Why is she crying?
I couldn't understand the reason.
But the fact is, Shiona is crying right in front of me.
Those tears are not fake.
Even so, I couldn't do anything.
……No, that's not true.
There must be something I can do.
I reach out my hand.
My fingertips were reaching towards Shiona's eyes.
I don't think I can stop those tears.
But I can wipe away the tears that have already fallen.
That's all I can do, but――
I extend my fingertips towards the large droplets.
Halfway there, my hand stopped.
My fingertips are made of metal.
The outstretched index finger has a unique metallic luster...
That's right.
I had forgotten.
No, I wanted to forget.
I am not human.
I am a created being.
Why is that?
Am I not even allowed to wipe away the tears of someone I care about?
Shiona cries.
She continues to shed tears.
Is that a sadness that Shiona has never shown before?
But I can't stop or wipe away those endlessly flowing tears.
Then why am I here?
What can I do for Shiona by being here?
I couldn't find the answer.
I couldn't move the outstretched mechanical hand any further...
――Immediately after, a dissonant sound of metal scraping echoed around.
The ear-splitting sound echoed intermittently.
Or so I thought, my outstretched fingertips――
The parts crumbled and fell to the floor.
The collapse that started from the fingertips spread to the palm――wrist――arm――shoulder, increasing its range.
Parts all over my body are falling apart.
Before long, it became difficult even to stand there, and I fell to the floor.
My legs, my torso, are turning into scrap.
Scrap metal is piling up around me.
Unable to even speak, I had no choice but to accept the collapse.
Shiona is crying the whole time.
Crying, trying to stifle her voice.
I can no longer even extend my mechanical hand.
Because there's no longer even an arm or fingertips there.
The collapse corrodes my entire body, reaching even my head.
I don't feel any pain.
I shouldn't feel anything.
But...
I felt pain deep within my chest, a place that should no longer exist.
The last thing I saw as my vision crumbled was Shiona's sad expression and tears.
Before long, I was just a pile of metal――
A mountain of scrap.
――And then, I wake up.
I was shouting something, but I don't remember.
My breathing is ragged.
I hurriedly look around.
A dimly lit, dusty space.
The lukewarm air sticks to me unpleasantly.
And thick books lined up on the shelves.
This was a library.
I must have fallen asleep yesterday and woken up this morning.
Hurriedly, I took off my glove and checked my right hand.
The thing that should have crumbled just now was still there, unchanged.
But, just like in the dream, it's made of machine.
On my lap, Tippy was already sound asleep.
His innocent sleeping face doesn't betray the sadness of yesterday.
It seems I was experiencing what humans call a dream.
During sleep mode, the memory area is reorganized, so you may catch glimpses of past records.
But what I just saw was probably a prediction based on experience and memory.
Does that mean this possibility is hidden in the future... that's what was calculated?
Even so, how sad.
I still couldn't calm the stirring in the depths of my heart.
Why do Shiona's tears disturb me so much?
And why am I so powerless?
I'm not real.
I knew that.
I thought I knew.
But even so, I want to make them smile.
I want to make Shiona, Tippy, and everyone in town smile.
But I can't do it.
I have an idea of the answer, but I don't want to admit it.
--It's because I'm artificial.
The one truth I can't resist.
But even so, I wished for it.
I want to make everyone around me smile.
But I can't make it happen.
When I try to make Tippy smile, Shiona doesn't smile.
When I try to make Shiona smile, I can't wipe away Tippy's tears.
How difficult.
Isn't there a better way to make everyone smile?
While looking at Tippy's sad sleeping face, I repeated it over and over in my heart.
I stroke Tippy's head with my fingertips.
His smooth hair lets my fingertips pass through to the ends without tangling.
A sweet scent spreads.
"Mmm... mmm..."
Is he dreaming? Tippy let out a small voice.
Looking at his childish sleeping face, my desire to protect him grows stronger.
But how?
Alternating between looking at my mechanical right hand and Tippy's face, I was at a loss.
I wished that this gentle time would last forever.
--But, it wasn't to be.
A strange sound echoed from afar.
It sounded like the footsteps of many people walking in perfect unison.
And, faintly, the sound of screams and something being destroyed.
Those two things shattered even my small hope.
Hurriedly, I put my glove on my right hand.
"W-What... Rei, what is it...?"
Tippy woke up, startled by the abnormality.
An anxious expression, which hadn't been there before, spread across Tippy's face.
"I don't know... but it seems like something's happened."
"Something? Something what?"
"I have no idea. But I'm sure it's not a good situation."
I stood up and pointed my toes towards the library aisle.
"...Rei? Where are you going?"
"I'm going to check things out a little."
"No... don't go, Rei."
"It's okay, I'm not going anywhere. I'm just going to check things out on the roof for a little while."
"No... I don't want you to go..."
Tippy hugged me and started to cry.
He must be superimposing my image with that of his parents, who disappeared.
"It's okay. It's okay, Tippy."
"No... no..."
"Have I ever broken a promise with Tippy?"
"That's, that's right. Whenever you said you'd go meet me, you always did, right?"
"So it's okay. I'll look from the roof and come right back."
"...Okay. But, come back quickly, okay?"
"Yeah, of course."
After making a promise with Tippy, I headed to the library roof.
I reached the top of the long spiral staircase and stood in front of an old, rusted door.
There was no sign that it had been used for a long time.
When I opened it, a grating, unpleasant sound echoed in my ears.
Without hesitation, I pushed the door open.
...At the same time.
An anomaly jumped into my eyes.
Black smoke was rising from all over town.
What I thought were screams were not a mishearing; they were coming from the mouths of townspeople fleeing from something.
And chasing after those townspeople were multiple figures clad in dirty cloaks.
They quietly walked while holding firearms--yet, with seamless coordination, they steadily cornered the fleeing people.
It was as if everything was calculated, such movements.
The townspeople, cornered against the wall, are exchanging words with the attackers.
The attackers exchange glances, nod, and point the muzzle of their guns at the townspeople's heads.
And, without the slightest hesitation, they pull the finger they had on the trigger.
--With a dry sound, their head shook violently as if exploding, and the townspeople collapsed on the spot... .
The sound snapped me back to reality, and I understood the situation.
It's hard to believe... but it seems this town is under attack.
What Siona said was true after all... .
I hurried back to the lobby.
Seeing me like that, Tippy asked anxiously.
"Rei... did something happen? You look really scared."
"...I don't really know... but... something bad is happening..."
Unable to tell Tippy what I had seen, I spoke vaguely.
"Something bad? What do you mean?"
"I think... this town is being attacked."
"No... Tippy's scared..."
"It's okay, it's far away in the town. It should still be safe here, so calm down."
"...Okay... but, what are we going to do?"
"I'm... going to go and see what's happening."
I was worried about the town, but I was even more worried about Siona.
Even after what happened yesterday, she's still a person who helped me.
I haven't even asked why Siona, who is kind to everyone, is so harsh only towards Tippy.
I still don't understand the meaning of her words that she said it was for my sake.
"No, don't go... please... Rei..."
"It's okay, Tippy. I'll definitely come back."
"Really? Really, really?"
"Yeah, of course. So, can you wait for me just a little bit?"
"If you're coming back, Tippy will wait."
Tippy hugged his bear tightly.
Even so, the anxiety couldn't be erased from his expression.
Is there nothing I can do to help this girl with her sadness and anxiety?
With such a guilty feeling in my heart, I left the library.
I decided to use back streets as much as possible on the way to town.
What's happening in town is clearly not good.
There's a risk that I might suffer some damage if I'm found.
I headed to the plaza, trying to make as little noise as possible.
I wanted to arrive before the squad if possible, but it didn't seem possible because I took detours repeatedly.
The closer I got to the center of town, the more broken buildings I noticed.
But those were all buildings that didn't seem like they would break until yesterday.
Were they destroyed by those strangers who were chasing the townspeople?
Dust and smoke drifted in the town that was beautiful until yesterday.
Why is it necessary to destroy the buildings in this peaceful town?
I just can't understand it.
As the screams and the noise of destroying buildings intensify, I arrive at the truth.
--The tragedy unfolding in the plaza.
Many men were chasing and capturing the townspeople.
They point their guns and use unreasonable violence as a shield, driving away men, women, and even children.
The captured townspeople are being made to sit in the center of the plaza.
Children cry. Inarticulate shouts of anger.
The armed men, not caring about those voices, wear cool expressions.
No, perhaps the expression "cool" is strange.
They had faces that showed no interest, like a fleeting glance at a stone lying on the roadside.
I can't see Siona anywhere within sight. I can assume she hasn't been captured yet, right...?
"--What's the situation?"
"--Most of the residents have been captured. It's only a matter of time for the rest."
Nearby, I overheard two men talking.
I slowly approached the two, trying not to be noticed, and eavesdropped.
"How about the water and food supplies?"
"They were sufficiently stocked. We even found an underground water source for the water."
"I see, so it's been a bigger harvest than expected."
"Yes, it's possible to settle here permanently."
I was convinced.
These men are the humans who attacked the town and are stealing water and food.
I just couldn't forgive their unreasonableness.
Hurting innocent people for the sole purpose of plunder.
But I couldn't do anything more than that.
I can't even jump out of that spot.
I knew better than anyone that I was powerless.
"But how did you find such a small town?"
"--There was a slave who escaped the other day, right?"
"If I remember correctly, he was advocating for coexistence with the Filoids..."
"Yes. A foolish man trapped in old-fashioned ideas. Coexistence and harmony with the Filoids, such useless thinking in this world."
--Coexistence and harmony...
That word brings to mind a young man.
The last words of the man I helped, brought to this town... and who passed away.
Does that mean that these humans were the ones who inflicted those injuries on him?
"So, we treated him the same as the Filoids, as living labor."
"That's right. When we chased after him to bring him back, he helped us in an unexpected way."
One of the men continued in a monotone voice.
"A human appeared who helped that man and guided us to the town."
Hearing those words, I felt a chill run down my spine.
Why didn't I think about the cause of that young man's injuries back then?
I should have known from Siona that there was a group carrying out looting...
Even when returning to town, if I had paid more attention to my surroundings, I might have avoided being followed.
I regret taking such reckless action on a momentary impulse.
I am the one who created the cause of this attack--...
"We have finished gathering the main people of the town in one place. There are zero resisters."
"I see. Then, select from among them those who are orally ingestible and lack production or management skills. Factors that reduce productivity are--"
As he said that, the man receiving the report pulled a pistol from his pocket.
"Dispose of them."
"--Stop!"
At the same moment I understood the meaning of those words, I shouted.
However, I couldn't help but shout at these humans who so casually said 'dispose of' the townspeople who had taken care of me.
At that, the men who were there turned around.
And our eyes met.
"Secure him."
With that voice, the men rushed towards me.
In a panic, I started running.
But my body can't keep up with my feelings.
My feet aren't moving well, and I ended up running away while losing my balance.
The men are quickly closing in behind me.
Their movements are as precise as machines.
Damn it, I'll be caught at this rate.
As a last resort, I ran into an alleyway.
The alleyway has many puddles due to the rain.
While struggling with my footing, I run through it.
Occasionally, I knock over lumber leaning against the wall, trying to slow the men down.
But that's not enough to stop them.
I could tell that the men were right behind me.
Can I escape like this...?
What I was aiming for was the library.
Even if I could escape to the library, Tippy's existence would be revealed to them.
If Tippy were to be attacked--.
I changed the direction of my toes.
I ran into what seemed to be a back door of the nearest building.
By chance, it was Mr. Mad's general store.
I looked for a place to hide--.
"! ?"
I found a figure sitting in a chair.
Mr. Mad doesn't answer. He was sitting shallowly in the chair with his arms crossed, just like after he turned the projector that day.
"Mr. Mad, you can hear me, right!? Stop joking around at a time like this, Mr. Mad-- Mr. Mad?"
I barely managed to swallow my scream.
The moment I touched Mr. Mad's shoulder, he—quietly collapsed from the chair. As if he were already dead.
W-Why--!
Did those men 'dispose of' him? But, there are no external wounds.
Target acquired.
What snapped me out of my near panic was, ironically, the voices of the men who had been chasing me.
But it was far too late.
We have enough manpower as it is, eliminate him.
Unable to do anything, I just frantically jumped back from Mr. Mad, the men stepped in, and the lead man aimed his pistol at me──
Lei!
Immediately after, several things happened at once.
A dry sound rang out, the sound of a gunshot.
And a figure slid in front of me, as if to protect me--.
Sio--
It took me a moment to grasp the situation.
That person was standing there, as if to protect me.
That person turned only their face to look at me.
With her usual unchanging smile, that person looked at me.
And, a few seconds later--.
Sionaaaaaa!
My mind went blank, and I screamed.
Seeing that sight, my body began to move unconsciously.
With the mechanical arm hidden beneath my glove, I punched and knocked over one of the shelves. That caused a chain reaction, toppling all the shelves in the store--scattering fine fragments and even finer dust everywhere.
At the same time, I picked up a can that had fallen on the floor and threw it with all my might at the window.
The men reacted to the sound of the window glass breaking.
Did they escape through the window?
Chase them!
The men jumped out of the open door and outside.
Did they go--
And as for me, I was crouching motionlessly right next to the fallen shelf, half of my body sunk into the floor where the impact had knocked it out.
Hugging the fallen Siona in my arms, so that the shelves and fragments wouldn't hit her.
Siona, Siona, hang in there!
I desperately shake Siona, whose eyes are closed.
It seems she has fainted.
I run my eyes over Siona's body, but I can't find any wounds.
Did the bullet not hit her? But, since she's unconscious, I can't say she's safe.
In any case, I have to evacuate immediately.
…Where can I do that nearby…
I take a deep breath and remember.
The girl I left waiting at the library.
I took the back streets, making sure the humans didn't spot me, and headed back to the library.
Carrying Siona on my back was a considerable handicap, but I kept moving, threading my way through the ruined buildings over and over.
During that time, Siona didn't move at all. That made it easier to carry her, but at the same time, my anxiety grew.
If something were to happen to Siona... Even as I felt crushed by that fear, I arrived at the library.
The clouds covering the sky were darkening even further.
Having finally reached the library, I started searching for Tipi.
Is Tipi safe?
So far, there are no signs that the library has been ransacked.
No signs that anyone has entered.
Passing through the entrance, the interior of the library was silent.
Feeling relieved, I weaved through the shelves, searching for Tipi.
But no matter how much I searched, I couldn't find Tipi.
Could it be--.
Trying to shake off the unpleasant thought, I searched the area desperately.
Could it be--.
Clinging to hope, I headed to the lobby.
I went around to the back.
There, I found Tipi, covering her ears and eyes, trembling slightly.
I reached out my hand to that small body.
Tipi, I'm back.
Tipi's shoulders twitched slightly.
But when she recognized me, she hugged me with the force of a jump.
Welcome back. I believed in you, Rei.
Large tears pressed against my chest.
Her body was trembling slightly.
Ah, I made this child anxious again.
I put my hand on her back and stroked it.
It's okay... I'll never leave you again.
Perhaps relieved by those words, Tipi's trembling lessened and eventually stopped.
What happened? What's wrong with Siona?
Tipi looked at Siona, whose eyes were closed, and asked anxiously.
I told her everything as it was, without hiding anything.
She was shot. To protect me... It doesn't look like she's injured, but she's unconscious...
Show me immediately!
With unprecedented agility, Tipi scooped up Siona and laid her on the floor.
Rei, turn around, I'm going to check Siona's wounds.
Ah, okay... Wait, is Siona injured!?
I don't know. But I'm going to check.
Seeing Tipi putting her hands on Siona's clothes, I hurriedly turned around.
Before long--.
I'm okay... no problem... Rei.
Tipi's tone had returned to normal.
I quietly turned around.
Siona was breathing peacefully on the lobby floor where I had laid her down.
I thought she had been shot protecting me, but it seems she just lost consciousness from the close-range gunshot.
I'm glad...
I sighed with heartfelt relief.
Rei, why was Siona shot?
Humans came. And they're starting to loot this town. Destroying buildings--
I didn't mention that they were trying to 'dispose' of the townspeople, or that Mad might already have been 'taken care of'.
So when I was found and about to be shot, Siona protected me--
I clenched my fist tightly without thinking. Tipi looked at me sadly,
--I see. But if that's the case... this place might be dangerous too.
She replied with a solemn face.
I wonder if we can get through this by hiding... somehow until the humans leave...
As if to stop me, Tipi sadly shook her head.
The humans have found this town. A town for them to live in. So, they'll come here too.
No way... are those guys going to settle down here...?
Because this is a 'town'.
Town... That's right.
I walked through the barren land until I reached this place.
No food, no water, always facing death.
Those humans must have traveled through such a world.
If so, this 'town' is a paradise they could only dream of.
But... even so, why do they do things like stealing? The people of this town would have accepted them.
It's for them to live.
It's wrong to think you can do anything if it's for that... that it's okay to sacrifice someone!
...Rei, scary...
Ah, sorry, I didn't mean to scare you, Tipi...
I released my fist, which I had clenched in anger, and stroked Tipi's head to reassure her.
Let's think about Tipi and Siona for now.
If we stay in town like this, these two will be in danger.
I really want to help everyone in town. But I can't right now. I don't have the power or wisdom.
I'll freeze the emotions that Siona and the townspeople taught me, and mechanically... make the most efficient choice.
Let's go somewhere we can settle down for a while.
Tipi, let's leave town for now. And let's think about how to help the townspeople.
As I said that, my chest tightened.
That's because I put a rank on lives.
I chose the lives in front of me, within reach.
That must be a shameful thing. The weight of life is equal, but... even so, I'm trying to choose...
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
The little girl's nod eases my guilt.
Let's hide in that abandoned factory for now. There shouldn't be anything there that humans would want.
Then, I have to prepare food for Rei and Siona...
That's right. I wish we could somehow stop by the church.
The library where we are now and the church are on opposite sides of the square, at opposite ends of town.
Even if we leave town and make a big detour, we'd be sitting ducks in an area with no cover. On top of that, I'll be carrying Siona on my back.
Does that mean we have to crawl under the rubble again? It'll be even harder this time since Tipi is with us...
I explained that to Tipi as clearly as possible.
Is it hard to go to the church?
Yeah... for now.
Then, we should go under.
...Under?
Yeah, under. Go to the church through under the ground.
Yeah, underground. If we go underground, no one will find us.
Underground... Underground, huh... But how?
Go inside through the manhole, and then go under the town.
...I see.
If we do that, we can definitely get to the church without being seen.
That's a great idea, Tipi! You're amazing, Tipi.
Hehe... Rei praised me.
But, where are the manholes located in town?
Hmm... Rei, come here.
Tipi takes my hand and leads me to the bookshelf.
Without even a little hesitation, she came to the front of a certain bookshelf.
That book.
I take the book Tipi is pointing at and open it.
Inside is a map of this town's manhole locations and its underground waterways.
You're amazing, Tipi! If we have this, we can get to the church without any problems.
Thank you... Rei.
I stroke her head, and Tipi narrows her eyes in delight.
Okay, Tipi. Let's get going right away.
Okay... but wait. I'll get ready, so just a little bit--wait?
Yeah, sure.
Thank you, Rei.
Tipi bowed quickly and disappeared into the back room.
Tipi said there was no problem, but I'm still worried that she hasn't regained consciousness.
Maybe the humans didn't use a gun that fires bullets, but a weapon that takes away freedom of movement.
If I know the cause, I'll know how to deal with it.
Is this how terrifying an unknown situation is?
Rei, sorry to keep you waiting. What's wrong?
Tipi came back from the back room.
No, it's nothing. I was just a little worried about Siona.
I answered, trying to appear as calm as possible.
So, what are you taking with you?
Tipi, who said she had prepared, was carrying a large bag.
A stuffed animal and... a picture book and... crayons.
I see. They're important to you, aren't they?
And... pictures of Papa and Mama.
Tipi said sadly.
Pictures of her parents, who will probably never come back.
I can't understand how Tipi feels as she stares at those pictures.
Um, well, what's this then?
Apart from the large bag, Tipi was carrying a thin but sturdy metal case. It seemed a little too rugged for petite Tipi to carry.
This is... I'll tell you about it later. More importantly, Rei, let's go.
Ah, okay...
With Tipi's help, I carry Siona, who is lying on the floor, on my back. Strangely, I couldn't feel the weight.
I'm ready, Tipi.
Okay, then... goodbye.
Tipi said goodbye to the countless bookshelves.
Her voice sounded somewhat sad.
I still haven't been able to heal this girl's sadness at all.
But I hadn't given up.
We'll be together from now on.
Even little by little, as we spend time together.
I want to heal Tipi's sadness.
And someday, I want to see Tipi with a heartfelt smile on her face.
That was my secret wish right now.
Now, let's go.
Yeah.
Without uttering a single complaint, Tipi followed me.
By the time we reached the church, we were quite exhausted.
There were no signs of humans around.
We cautiously looked around and stepped into the church.
The chapel was silent.
It was a silence that made the town's commotion seem like a lie.
I found a music box on the altar at the back of the chapel.
Was this where Siona listened to its melody?
The sound of my shoes as I walked towards the music box echoed loudly in the chapel.
I approached the altar and reached for the music box.
As I turned the handle, a melody poured out from inside.
That melody somehow warmed the depths of my heart.
Suddenly, I heard a singing voice.
It was coming from behind me.
Welcome back.
Siona said, and got off my back.
That's not important. Are you hurt anywhere? Tipi said you seemed okay, but...
Yeah, I think I'm okay.
Siona smiled to reassure me. Then, she looked at Tipi, who was next to her.
Tipi-chan... you came too, huh?
Yeah...
Tipi nodded, looking as sad as always--yet with a hint of resolve in her eyes.
Siona...
Tipi held her palm towards Siona, stopping her words.
I understand... I understand, but!
Siona looked down, as if enduring something.
Siona.
In response, Tipi was gentle as ever...
That was too unexpected. Siona stares at Tipi's small eyes, holding her breath.
While I was with Rei, I realized... what Siona is trying to do.
But, if you do that--
That's also why I came here. The library is impossible now... Probably this town too.
Tipi-chan, I'm sorry...
It's okay. Siona doesn't have to cry.
Tipi said softly, gently hugging Siona who jumped into her chest, kneeling.
It was as if Tipi was the older sister, giving me such an illusion.
Rei, what are we going to do now?
Tipi's words startled me back to my senses.
If Siona seems okay, I want to help the people in town. Especially the ones they said they're going to dispose of--
Dispose of?
Yeah...
It was a terrible way of putting it... Talking about fellow humans as if they weren't human.
Can you do it, Rei?
I don't know, but... even so, I can't just stand by and watch someone get killed in front of me.
But, you'll be in danger, Rei.
Yeah, I know that, but...
They're the kind of guys who'll point a gun at you without a second thought. There's nothing I can do by confronting them head-on.
I'm sure I won't even be able to have a discussion with them.
I promise. If it gets even a little dangerous, I'll definitely turn back.
Promise me. If you get hurt, Rei... everything will be irreversible.
Yeah. I can't leave Siona behind either.
Rei...
Siona--
With that one word, we separated as if repelled by magnets.
S-Sorry! It's not like I forgot about Tipi-chan!
It's not fair, just Siona...
Tipi said, pouting her lips slightly.
I'm sorry, Tipi. I didn't mean it that way...
I apologized, gently stroking Tipi's head.
Muu... That's not what I mean...
Even so, Tipi's expression wasn't entirely displeased.
First Siona laughed at that sight--then I, and then Tipi, smiled too.
And so, we laughed together.
Without anyone saying it, the three of us held hands.
We gripped each other's hands tightly, as if never to let go again.
And before that resolve could waver, I declared.
From now on, let's always be together, the three of us. Always--
But, as if mocking me...
Footsteps echoed in the distance.
Siona's smile, Tipi's smile, stiffened.
I'm sure I'm stiffening too.
All the townspeople have been captured.
Then, the one heading towards this church now is--.
Without a doubt, it's a human.
I was the first to move. I looked outside from the window, being careful not to make a sound.
There's one figure. However, I don't know how many are coming in the rear.
Siona, Tipi, go to the back of the chapel. Crouch down as much as possible, so you can't be seen from outside.
Okay, but shouldn't we lock the door first?
No. If we do that, they'll definitely call for backup. If that happens, we won't stand a chance.
I want to neutralize the human outside without making any noise if possible.
If it's one person, I think I can manage. If it's two, we can somehow manage with a surprise attack.
But, if it's three or more--I haven't told Siona or Tipi, but I was prepared to be captured alone.
I muffled my footsteps and stood in the shadow of the door. In the meantime, the footsteps are getting closer and closer.
The number is one. For now, there's nothing following behind.
…Haaah…
I quietly took a deep breath and steeled myself.
I held my breath. The footsteps are--right next to me.
The door slowly opened.
Then a man with a pistol slowly enters.
--Now!
In that instant, I swung my arm down with all my might from his blind spot.
Immediately, I kicked away the pistol that fell to the floor.
At the same time, I tried to sweep his legs, but he dodged it, as expected.
We're still at a distance where we're almost touching.
It's safe to assume he possesses weapons other than a gun.
If so, I can catch him off guard by pouncing on him the moment he reaches for it.
But the man quietly tilted his head and looked at me.
What do you intend to do?
He asked in a monotonous voice.
Why are you hostile to us? Are you the owner of this town?
Owner? I just want to do what's best for the people of this town.
That's just like something a Philoid would say.
…So what if it is…? That's my reason for existence.
As I said that, I removed the glove from my right hand, showing off my mechanical hand.
It's not a good idea to fight me head-on with my mechanical body.
If I can make him think that, he might back down.
Right now, all that matters is ensuring the safety of Siona and Tipi. Even if my true identity is revealed to them, I'll protect what I want to protect.
That's my role as a Philoid.
The man tilted his head again at my actions.
What are you talking about? Philoids can't engage in combat at all. They're made to obey orders, so they can't defy humans.
"Huh?"
"In any case, you are an incompatible element trapped by old-fashioned ideas. I will eliminate you before you become a source of trouble."
The blade is thrust straight towards my throat.
I grab the knife blade with my mechanical right hand. Then, I put all my strength into twisting it sharply.
That alone snaps the knife blade clean off at the base.
I put all my weight into pushing him down. I press my left elbow against his throat and pin both his legs with my knees—
"Rei!"
Shiona bursts out from the back of the room.
I press down on his throat with my left hand and, raising my bare metal right hand, I say.
This metal arm broke the knife. If I swing it down on his head with all my might, he won't be unscathed.
"Rei, stop it."
Shiona pleads in a trembling voice.
…But.
Biting my back teeth, I swing down my right hand with all my strength—
My right hand was half-buried.
Not in the man's head, but in the floor right next to it.
"Why spare me? Considering your own safety, killing me is the correct choice."
The man says so, remaining expressionless as ever.
"That's not true. Killing is the wrong choice no matter the reason."
"Incorrigible. Such inefficient thinking."
"I'm going to take you hostage. And make them release the people of the town."
I grab him by the collar and pull him up.
"That's meaningless. My life isn't worth that much. If my death now opens the future for my comrades, I have no reason to regret it."
Without changing his tone at all, the man takes something out of his pocket.
It was an old-fashioned bomb. He pulls out the safety pin and grabs my arm at the same time.
"What!"
I pull my arm back reflexively, but it doesn't budge.
I shudder.
How can this human not show any emotion on his face, even at this moment when he's about to throw away his life?
I felt like I was bound by the color of his eyes, which seemed to lack any will.
──No good! If I let my thinking stop, it's over!
I instantly switch gears and start analyzing the situation.
The man is holding a really small bomb, about the size of a small fruit.
But, since it's a bomb, it will have lethal force, and more importantly, the explosion might alert the humans staying in the town.
When, when will it explode?
He intends to blow himself up. It's certain that there isn't much time.
But, what should I do? If the explosion is too big, Shiona and the others hiding will be affected.
It's impossible to neutralize this bomb, so what's the best way to minimize its effect?
I reflexively hug the man. In a way that sandwiches the bomb.
This way, at least I might be able to protect Shiona and the others from the blast. It might be imperfect, but it's the best choice I can think of.
If only the two of us can make it through──
The next moment, the impact came.
From the side. Like being shoved away... no, different, I was shoved away!
While rolling on the floor, I look at where I was.
There, Shiona was holding the bomb.
"Shiona!"
"Get down!"
The bomb she was holding burst with a strong light and sound.
Perhaps the scale of the explosion wasn't that large because it was a type of bomb not intended for killing.
Even so, I, who was at point-blank range, took the full force of the blast and sound and felt dizzy.
The human who was also at point-blank range is unconscious.
"Shiona!"
In my vision that was swaying dizzily, I shouted.
Please, please be safe.
"Shiona!?"
"...Rei..."
"Shio...na..."
"Shiona, we need to treat you immediately!"
The distance of a few steps felt incredibly long.
Slapping my faltering legs, I approach Shiona.
And then, I saw it.
"What... is this..."
Seeing Shiona's figure, I was speechless.
Her right arm thrown on the floor... from the wrist onward... a metallic ――frame?
Not bone. Absolutely not. It's clearly different from that of a human.
And ―― it's not there.
That's strange.
Something that should be there, wasn't.
Red.
That is the proof of a human.
"Wh... wh... why?"
"B, but..."
I clench my mechanical right hand covered with a glove.
That's right, if we were the same... if only we were the same... .
"Shiona, are you... alright ――?"
"Yeah, I'm fine with just this much."
There's no way that's true, is there?
There's no way that could be true.
You took the explosion at such a close distance.
There's no way you could be alright.
It must be so painful that she can't help but shed tears from the intense pain.
And yet.
And yet, why?
"Rather than me... Rei, your head."
I followed Shiona's gaze and touched my head.
Ah, why is this?
Why is it that something Shiona needs is with me?
I don't need this.
I don't need this, so I wish Shiona had it.
No, she should have had it.
Shiona touches my head and says.
"You're bleeding, are you okay?"
Blood was flowing from my head.
Red.
Red blood.
Something that doesn't flow in Phylloids...
In contrast, not a single drop of blood was flowing from Shiona's arm.
Instead, exposed mechanical parts are visible.
What this means is only one thing.
That is ――.
"...Rei? There was a big noise, are you alright ―― Shiona!? Rei!?"
Tipi, who came out from the back, screamed.
With an uneasy expression, her eyes are filled with large tears.
"Both of you, we have to heal your injuries...!"
"It's okay... I'm okay..."
I gently hug Tipi, who was on the verge of panicking, as if to envelop her.
Hugged by me, Tipi showed a slightly relieved expression in my chest.
But it was an unstable thing.
It looked as if it was about to collapse at any moment, and it hurt deep inside my chest to see it.
"Rei... let's move, we can't stay here anymore..."
Tipi says in a trembling voice. Shiona nods in agreement.
Certainly, with the sound of the explosion just now, the other humans will definitely come.
There were many things I wanted to ask.
There were many things I wanted to confirm.
But, I swallow it for now.
"...Let's go, let's leave the town."
We left the church with only the bare minimum of luggage.
Then, following Tipi's instructions, we used the back streets of the town to escape to the outside, aiming for the abandoned factory.
I am made to realize it there too...
It was only me whose steps became heavy with fatigue.
Led by Tipi, and with Shiona holding my hand, we continue walking.
Reaching the abandoned factory, I finally lowered myself to the ground.
Next to Shiona, who has a cool face, I regulate my rough breathing.
"Tipi, go get some water."
The small girl glanced at Shiona before disappearing into the depths of the abandoned factory.
She probably entrusted all the explanations to Shiona.
"...Shiona."
At my voice, Shiona returns a slightly troubled smile.
"I think you've already noticed, but I am... no. Everyone living in this town is a Phylloid."
That was... what I was trying to avert my eyes from.
I had a premonition... I felt something was off... but it was something I didn't want to admit...
"So... I'm a 'Human'?"
When my head was damaged, a red liquid leaked from the damaged area.
It closely resembled the 'blood' that flows inside a Human's body.
Phylloids aren't equipped with such a liquid, so it shouldn't flow.
"You've been misunderstanding all along because you have a mechanical arm... that's an artificial medical part to compensate for limbs lost in an accident or something."
"So... then I really am..."
"Yes, you are a Human. The parent and partner of us Phylloids. That is you. Everyone in town is a Phylloid. Only you were a Human."
"I see..."
I stare at my mechanical right hand covered in a glove and weakly clench it.
The existence I had imagined until now was the complete opposite...
Shiona is a Phylloid... and I am a Human...
In other words, I am a Human, the very existence I should hate.
I felt something deep inside my chest.
That feeling was painful.
Sad.
And infuriating.
I was the same existence as those who were cold-hearted, merciless, and could only be seen as evil.
My chest ached unbearably.
I feel anger at the unchangeable fact.
What the man I was dealing with earlier said was correct.
I was not a Phylloid, but a Human.
And those Humans, the rulers, are trying to do terrible things to the Phylloid townspeople, the ruled -- no, they probably already are.
How did things end up like this?
I just wanted to live with Shiona and the townspeople.
I just wanted to make everyone happy.
But, but, but--
I can't do that.
Because I'm a Human.
Because I am a member of a hopeless species.
I felt warmth in my fist, which I had been unconsciously clenching.
When I lowered my gaze, I saw Shiona's hand placed over mine.
That temperature is artificial.
But, it didn't matter to me.
...Warm.
Just that alone thinned out the emotions that were burdening my heart.
But at the same time, it highlights my own inadequacy.
Do I even deserve her kindness?
Want to know more? About you all?
Shiona said, directing a smile towards me.
You all meaning... Humans?
Yes, Humans. Do you want to know about our partners?
If I can know, I want to know.
So I nodded.
I want to know... I want to know why we ended up like this.
Do you remember the picture of Tipi-chan in the library, Rei?
Ah, I remember...
Tipi-chan draws that picture every day. Every single day, no matter what, one picture a day.
I closed my eyelids and recalled that scene.
There were dozens, hundreds of those pictures drawn with crayons.
How many do you think there are?
I don't know... If Tipi is also a Phylloid, she's probably been drawing for years... maybe there are about a thousand.
Eighty-six thousand six hundred and seventy-one.
Eighty-six thousand--
Once again, a strong dizziness attacked me. But it wasn't from the earlier explosion or the subsequent bleeding.
Has Tipi spent so long, all alone, in that dark library?
Hardly anyone ever came to that library.
It must have been a lonely existence.
Just thinking about the time Tipi has spent there, I felt a terror as if I was losing my footing.
And Tipi has endured it.
With that small body.
Several decades before that, we Phylloids were born. Desired by Humans--
Shiona told me the history of the Phylloids as if singing a song.
First, Phylloids were androids that had reached the practical stage, equipped with human emotions.
Basic emotional information was installed from the beginning, and a system was adopted that allowed them to learn new emotions through self-propelled thinking circuits.
Including that, it can be said that they are as close to humans as possible.
Therefore, they were able to become as close to humans as possible, not only in work but also in life.
Eventually, companies appeared that installed custom-made emotions and memories, and an unprecedented Phylloid boom arrived.
It was an era in which families who could not have children purchased Phylloid children, and those who had lost parents or children ordered Phylloids with their memories.
The number of Phylloids increased in the blink of an eye, and in just over a decade, the number produced equaled the human population.
Among them, the most revolutionary was the Phylloid equipped with 'love,' the most complex emotion of humans.
It had the ability to serve as a life partner.
They could obtain a loved one without going through the process of romance, and that love was guaranteed semi-permanently.
In a society where late marriage was progressing and more humans were prioritizing work over romance, the demand was great and it was received with applause.
However, children were not born into families who married Phylloids, which accelerated the declining birthrate.
And the declining birthrate created a shortage of marriage partners, leading to a loop in which more and more people entered into marital relationships with Phylloids.
And then, before they knew it, humans forgot how to nurture love.
Shiona smiled sadly.
Human children began to be created artificially using science. But humans who had lost love could not teach love to the children who were born.
Love was the origin of all emotions.
Because there is love, you feel the joy of connecting with someone.
Because there is love, you know what you want to protect and feel anger when it is hurt.
Because there is love, you feel sadness when you lose something important.
Because there is love... you share the same emotions, share them, and know joy.
But... they forgot it.
The humans who came to town are probably those kinds of Humans.
Humans who have forgotten 'emotion' along with love have even lost the ability to care for others.
Humans no longer needed love, and the existence of Phylloids with emotions became unpleasant.
When considering the efficiency of actions, there was too much waste...
Humans eventually came to believe that Phylloids should be machines.
Daring to go to harsh environments... work involving danger... abuse beyond specification limits...
But there were also humans who did not approve of this.
Humans who retained the emotion of love appealed. Phylloids are partners.
The world was divided into two.
Humans with love, and humans without.
And the humans without love concluded.
The ideas of the old generation are foolish and should be annihilated...
They didn't even hesitate to press the button for a weapon that would burn the earth.
After that, everything was fast.
It took less than five days for retaliation to call for retaliation, and for the world to be enveloped in flames and ash.
Polluted toxic land, black clouds blocking the sunlight, a sea that cannot nourish life.
Human history would come to an end by its own hand...
It was such a foolish choice.
We, who were born for humans, took away what was most important to humans.
That's not true... the fault lies with us humans in everything...
But you know, there were many humans who survived. No matter how tattered the world becomes, life doesn't stop.
I can't find the words to reply to Shiona, who speaks to me so kindly.
...Ahem, ah, ahhh, ahh.
Suddenly, Shiona started practicing her voice.
And then, facing me directly, looking puzzled--
"Nice to meet you. I'm MODA-117 Alice mk-17, manufactured by Asou International. Have you completed your user registration? If you have, please decide on my individual name. It's the first name given to me. Please choose it carefully!"
I was caught off guard.
I could just say I've never seen this before... but it's the first time I've seen Shiona so utterly cheerful and innocent.
"Surprised?"
Shiona asked, back to her usual self.
"Y-yeah..."
"That's the oldest memory I have."
I wonder when that was. I can't even imagine.
"Back then, every day was like a festival... it was so lively."
Saying that, Shiona showed me a piece of paper that looked like a newspaper clipping.
"World-renowned Musician Passes Away"
The photo on it was the same one in the photo frame in Shiona's room.
It was someone with a face similar to mine.
"Is this... your brother?"
"Yes, this story is also from a long time ago... You know, I'm the latest model among the Phylloids that were manufactured. Fifth generation, I think."
I wonder how Shiona feels about referring to herself as 'manufactured'.
Phylloids have emotions just like humans.
In other words, they're the same as humans.
Can she really be so detached about it?
"My generation was the first model to be equipped with the concept of human 'death'. It was to get as close to humans as possible. But models before me don't have that... that's the case with Mad and Tippy-chan. Neither of them can understand 'death'. It's useless to explain it. The day they understand will never come."
To keep waiting without knowing death.
It's a hope that exists, but a hope that will never be rewarded.
Despair in the name of hope.
To be confronted with that unconditionally.
If I were to be confronted with something like that, wouldn't it be better to be taught despair from the start?
I thought it would be better that way.
"Tippy-chan is an even earlier model... I think she was a second-generation Phylloid. Up to the second generation, they can't extract energy from food. That's why she runs on electricity. But there's a limit to how long the battery lasts. She carries that bear plushie as an auxiliary battery."
Come to think of it, Tippy always had that plushie in her hands whenever she moved.
I had no idea it was a battery.
But that explains something.
Why Tippy was always in that library.
That library has the only power generation system in town.
Tippy stayed in that place to continue functioning.
"Tippy-chan's parents also died a long time ago. Probably more than 200 years ago. But Tippy-chan, who has no concept of death, is waiting. Forever and ever, all alone."
What a cruel story.
I don't know the lifespan of a Phylloid, but Tippy has spent hundreds of years like that.
Shedding tears every day.
Trapped by a future that will never come... by an unfulfilled hope.
In that library, all alone.
It feels like I have a lead ball in my chest.
It's painful and agonizing.
But the more I think about it, the deeper it sinks into me.
"But, it still hurts even knowing it."
And Shiona recognizes death. Meaning, she can't even hold onto the hope of seeing them again.
"Ray, you saw Mad-san collapse at the general store, right?"
"Yeah... it was strange. It was like only his soul left, even though he had no external wounds--"
I understand now. Mad-san was already broken back then.
"But, we have to keep living like this. Until the day of our death--the day we break. For us who don't get sick, that's a time equal to eternity. That's why we try to be human. Wouldn't it be too sad otherwise? We take over the work our partners were doing, or fill in for positions that have disappeared... Just like humans used to, we keep the world turning. So that this world that humans turned never stops."
Mad-san ran the general store.
There were photo studios, bars, and all sorts of shops in town.
And all of that was thanks to the work of the Phylloids.
It was the effort of the Phylloids to protect the human world.
It was the last hope of the Phylloids who were left behind.
"We spend every day so that when humans return someday, we can tell them about that fun world, so we can return it to them."
Shiona showed me a smile.
An emotion that definitely doesn't fit the current situation.
With that smile, Shiona was protecting herself.
That smile looked sad to me.
"...But, we Phylloids also have a defect. That is, if something unbearably painful happens, only some kind of emotion comes to the forefront. I'm like this, Mad-san is always angry, and Tippy-chan is always sad."
But, Shiona continued.
"That's our last fortress. If even that emotion disappears, we'll break... we'll die."
"Then, when Shiona was shot, Mad-san was--"
"That's right. He didn't go on a trip or anything. After Ray finished showing him that movie, Mad-san stopped mov-- no, he stopped moving."
"Then, closing the store was--Shiona?"
"Yeah. I thought that if I didn't, Ray, not to mention the townspeople, would start to wonder. And you did, didn't you?"
"Well, yeah, but..."
If the store had stayed open there, I definitely would have gone inside and found Mad-san, who had stopped moving.
If the humans hadn't come, I probably never would have noticed.
In the end, it was confirmed that I wasn't just seeing things.
I didn't want to believe it, but that was the truth.
"My brother used to say, 'Emotions are pieces of the puzzle of life.' The piece called emotion connects life. If emotion is missing, all the pieces will crumble. That's the same for humans and Phylloids. Mad-san broke because the emotion of anger towards his son dissipated."
If that's the case, then I killed Mad-san.
I found the playback device on my own, and I showed Mad-san his son's movie without permission.
If I hadn't done such a thing, Mad-san would still be moving without breaking.
Sensing my feelings, Shiona moved to my left side and placed her hand on mine.
"It's okay, it's not Ray's fault. Sooner or later, we're all destined to end up like that. It's the same as humans not being able to escape death. Mad-san was surely happy. He was able to know his son's true feelings in the end."
"Maybe so. But--"
An unbearable feeling swells up.
If I had known that back then--I would have stopped him, even if I had to force him.
"You're kind, Ray--"
"That's not true..."
Shiona stood next to me.
I couldn't see Shiona's expression.
Anxiety pounded against my chest from the inside.
"Because even knowing it, I still wish for it. I wonder if I'll ever see that smile again."
Shiona smiled sadly as she looked at her brother's photo.
"That's why, when I first met Ray, I was so happy. Ah, so it was a dream after all, I thought. My brother was alive."
The act of dying.
It was painful whether you knew about it or not.
Humans create us to their liking, force families upon us, and then leave, leaving behind only the pain of death.
Selfish and awful.
That was us, humans.
"Tippy-chan feels the loneliness of losing her family. So, if she acts like a family member, she'll 'die'. But that doesn't mean I don't want you to say those words to Ray. We Phylloids have a rule that we can't do or say anything that 'makes them realize we're Phylloids'. Because it would shatter the humans' dreams. But, I went too far... I'm sorry."
When Shiona lowered her head, a sweet scent wafted around.
Certainly, what Shiona did might not be forgivable.
But, considering Shiona's feelings, it was clear that the means she chose were the most appropriate.
"It can't be helped. Shiona just followed the rules, it's not her fault."
Forgiving someone like this, and being forgiven by someone.
Apologizing, and being apologized to.
Crying, getting angry, laughing.
That's what humans are.
They, the Phylloids, knew that best of all.
"Thank you for telling me, Shiona. For being so kind to me, a human--"
I felt ashamed as a human.
To be repaying the kindness of these devoted Phylloids with evil.
Even as we speak, humans in town might be 'disposing' of Phylloids.
And the Phylloids probably can't offer much resistance to that.
Thinking that, I couldn't hide the pain deep inside my chest.
Shiona gently reached out and embraced me.
A warm warmth enveloped me.
"Of course. Humans and Phylloids are partners, both in the past and now. It's decided that it will be that way far into the future too."
I felt like the emotion I couldn't understand until the very end was there.
It was warm, vast, deep, strong, gentle, soft, large, and precious.
Humans had lost something great.
But, they remembered what the humans had forgotten.
For years, for decades, for centuries.
Even while enduring loneliness, they had continued to protect it.
I felt like I had to inherit that and protect it in the same way.
It wasn't an obligation or an order.
It was something I myself desired.
"I'm back, I found some clean water."
As I was sharing body heat with Shiona, Tippy called out to me from behind.
For some reason, I felt embarrassed and instinctively distanced myself from Shiona.
The warmth that had been touching my skin was snatched away by the air.
But, that gap was immediately filled with a new warmth.
When I looked, Tippy had squeezed in between me and Shiona.
"Tippy too--wants a hug."
Shiona and I looked at each other.
Shiona seemed to be entrusting the decision to me.
Tippy had lived in solitude for two hundred years.
If things stayed as they were, Tippy could continue to live semi-permanently without breaking.
But, would that be happiness?
Does an empty life have any value?
I embraced Shiona.
Including Tippy, who was standing between us.
Shiona hugged me back in the same way.
Tippy hugged both of us and murmured softly.
"Warm..."
It was warmth for the first time in two hundred years.
Tippy had been waiting for something so trivial for two hundred years.
That was a very sad time...
If I could give Tippy two hundred years' worth of warmth, I would definitely want to give it to her.
Because then, I feel like I could say that Tippy's waiting time wasn't in vain.
"What are you going to do now, Ray?"
Shiona asked me, still holding Tippy from behind.
"If I could... I still want to help everyone in town... but I don't think I can right now."
I feel bad for the people in town, but I don't have the power to do that.
First, I want to secure the safety of Shiona and Tippy.
"It's a little far, but let's go to the factory where I woke up."
No, that place probably wasn't a factory.
A facility where people continued to sleep until the world, uninhabitable due to war, and its polluted land became a little better.
My... awakening was a little late.
"There was still electricity there. Shiona and I can ingest food orally, so we'll be fine with the food we brought from town. But in Tippy's case, she needs to be charged."
"Shiona..."
Tippy raised her voice, probably realizing it just from those words.
"Yes, that's right... I'm sorry."
"No. I thought I had to say it soon."
Tippy continued, sounding somewhat sad, yet with a slightly firm expression.
"Tippy also has to do what Tippy can do... while there's still time."
"...Tippy-chan?"
Something must have caught her attention, as Shiona questioned Tippy.
"Let's survive, the three of us."
Those were words without any certainty.
There were no guarantees.
Even so, all I could do was continue to say those words.
"We're going to survive, the three of us, forever and ever."
It was just an ideal.
I know the world isn't sweet enough to live on ideals alone.
Of course, Shiona probably knows that too.
Even so, Shiona didn't question me at all.
Anxiety and dissatisfaction.
She sealed all those words away.
Surely her heart must have been filled with them.
In fact, my heart was being ravaged by those feelings.
Even so, it was necessary.
Words of hope.
"...Okay."
Shiona nodded and hugged me and Tippy even tighter.
And so, we began our journey towards the facility.
"This is... outside the town..."
Facing the wasteland, Tippy hugged her bear plushie to her chest.
"Is it different from the scenery Tippy knows?"
"Yes. When I saw it before, there was a road, a forest, and then--and then--"
The scenery Tippy described was an even larger version of the festival-like days Shiona had told me about.
Apparently, back then, humans freely controlled not only towns, but also nature, phylloids, and even the weather.
"So... by the time I started operating, humans were already beginning to decline..."
Shiona looked a little sad. The hem of her clothes billowed in the dust-filled wind.
"Alright, let's go!"
With a little food and spare batteries for Tippy, we started walking through the wasteland to survive.
And above all, to survive.
Struggling, struggling, to survive.
Floundering, floundering, to stay alive.
Just being alive is enough.
Just being alive had value.
I sincerely thought so.
Using the position of the sun, faintly discernible through the dim clouds, as a guide, I walked while searching my memory.
As the sun set and the temperature dropped, the three of us snuggled together to sleep.
Sometimes singing songs, sometimes encouraging each other, sometimes joking around...
Continuing a journey that was not always just painful.
We crossed the reddish-brown earth and reached our destination around the time the sun began to set, after three full days.
"The building is half-buried in sand... no wonder we couldn't find it. I can't believe this facility was still here..."
When we entered, faint lights flickered on, and the air conditioning hummed faintly from somewhere.
The room was exactly as it had been when I woke up. For now, I gathered up all the phylloid parts that would be unpleasant for Shiona and Tippy and put them away.
I'm sure these phylloids were protecting us humans while we were in cold sleep.
"Yay, I can sit down!"
Tippy ran ahead and quickly sat on the sofa that was there.
As soon as she sat down, the strength drained from her body.
It seems like we were pushing her too hard.
"...It's kind of cold here."
"It's originally a facility for cold sleep, after all."
Even though we're indoors, it's a little colder than outside.
Now that the air conditioning is working, I want to believe that the function to raise the temperature inside the facility is still there.
But I don't know where it is.
"I wish we had some kind of heater..."
"We can do this. Rei, sit next to Tippy."
"Like this?"
"Closer!"
"L-like this?"
When I asked that, almost completely pressed against Tippy, Shiona looked satisfied and said,
"Yeah, this should be fine!"
And then she sat on the opposite side of Tippy, the side not pressed against me.
--Firmly pressed together, like Tippy and I.
"See, isn't it warmer now?"
"Y-yeah... I guess so."
It's certainly warm. It's warm, but...
"How is it? Tippy-chan. Are you still cold?"
"Hmm... warm."
Tippy narrowed her eyes and snuggled against my arm.
"Warm? Oh, good."
"Yeah, warm... really warm, Rei. It's like..."
"Like what?"
"When we're like this, it's like a family."
"............"
"Tippy's Papa and Mama often hugged Tippy like this."
"Yeah. It's like that time, it's warm."
"...Yeah, it's warm, isn't it."
"...Hey, can you hug me again? Can you hug Tippy tight?"
I almost hugged her without thinking, but I stopped when I felt Shiona's sad gaze.
"Tippy-chan, we can't do that."
"Why? Won't you hug me?"
"Yes, that's right. Because Tippy-chan, we're not family or anything."
"Not family... is Tippy all alone?"
"Yes. No matter how long we're together, you're alone. That's something that can't be changed."
If you only picked up the words, they sound cold, as if she hated Tippy.
But I understand now.
That those words are full of kindness.
The only emotion left within Tippy.
--Sadness.
To fill Tippy's heart means to release her from sadness...
In other words, it's the same as dying.
Until now, I had been hugging Tippy without thinking.
But perhaps that was a kindness that was far too cruel.
No, perhaps it wasn't even kindness.
It was just a self-satisfying act that only shortened Tippy's lifespan.
Shiona had been enduring it all this time.
To protect Tippy's feeling of sadness... and more than anything, to protect Tippy.
She must have really wanted to hug her.
She must have wanted to pat her head and say kind words.
She must have wanted to give her a smile that turned her heart orange.
Without reaching out to this blue girl, she had been enduring it all along.
That's why I thought I had to endure it too.
That's what I thought... but I couldn't stop myself.
I just couldn't bring myself to abandon this girl with the sad look on her face in front of me.
I hugged Tipi, and by extension, Siona.
My eyes are getting hot.
I know this is shortening Tipi's lifespan, but I ask myself why I can't stop.
Am I just temporarily satisfying my own desires...?
I really am human after all...
Selfish, full of self-interest, a human who hurts others.
I hugged them both tightly, painfully so.
I embraced the warmth of two people.
As if to fill the void of two hundred years, we brought our warmth closer.
The warmth of three people doesn't let you feel the cold, even in the freezing facility.
It was that warm.
A melody naturally spilled from Siona's mouth.
That song that Onii-san made.
That melody lights a warmth deep in my heart.
Her gentle singing voice echoes through the factory.
"Tipi loves Siona's singing of that song,"
Tipi says, burying her face in my chest.
"It reminds me of when Papa and Mama were here... and for some reason, the tears won't stop."
A girl repeating sadness.
Tipi has been repeating that sadness for two hundred years.
I may not be able to wipe away that two hundred years of sadness.
But I can give her this moment of warmth.
I decided to put two hundred years' worth into this fleeting warmth and hug them both.
But that small moment didn't last long.
"Huh... Tipi?"
I turn my gaze to Tipi sitting on the sofa.
There, Tipi was staring blankly ahead.
"What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?"
"Hmm? ...Hmm..."
She doesn't seem well.
Is it because she's been released from the tension, or because she's walked too much?
Either way, she seems to need rest.
"Tipi seems tired too, so shall we call it a day?"
"...Y-yeah."
She replies a beat late. It seems she was thinking about something.
"Rei, Tipi-chan might be lacking energy. That's why her attention is scattered."
"I see... then we need to replenish her electricity. --But, how do we do that?"
"It's non-contact charging. The charging equipment should be common, so first we need to find a connector and charge the bear plushie."
"Understood. I'll ask you to confirm if I find something that looks like it."
"Leave it to me!"
Leaving Tipi on the sofa, I check what's in the facility.
Many cold sleep devices are lined up. I look for one that is still leaking cold air.
Then, I open the maintenance cover at the base and examine some of the cables connected to the distribution panel.
Before long, I discover something that looks like a power connector connected to a thick cable.
"Yeah, this type should be fine. Tipi-chan, lend me the plushie."
Siona borrows the bear plushie from Tipi, opens the zipper on its back, and exposes the connection terminal.
When she inserts the charging connector there, the bear's eyes blink twice.
That must be the signal that charging has started, and Siona breathes a sigh of relief.
Tipi also grips the bear's hand tightly. Just by doing that, the power seems to be transmitted, and I feel that the light in her eyes has intensified.
"Siona, let's have a meal too."
I show her the oral blocks I found when I was looking for the charging cable.
It's the same thing I found when I left this facility.
"The taste isn't comparable to Siona's soup, but I think it has nutrition."
"No, I'm happy because I was hungry. Just being able to have a meal makes my heart feel warm."
I line up the portable plates and place the oral blocks on top of them.
I thought this would make it look a little more like a meal.
Because it's a time like this, I want to cherish the everyday things, even the trivial ones.
I wanted to imitate, even a little, what we did in that town──at Siona's house.
"It looks delicious."
Siona smiled as if understanding my wish.
The two of us put our hands together before the meal.
Tipi, who was watching us, comes to our side.
Then, she puts the bear plushie in front of her and puts her hands together just like us.
"Together with everyone."
"Tipi-chan...?"
"Haha, Tipi is a great feast. Very luxurious."
Tipi looked embarrassed and shy.
It was a time of peace in these past few days, which have been full of hardships.
Surely in the distant past, we humans lived this kind of life with our partners called Philoids.
No, it should be a life that can still be regained.
Just like I, who had lost my emotions, was taught by them... I should be able to regain the forgotten time...
I was thinking about such things while carrying the oral block remaining on the plate to my mouth.
──That's when it happened.
『Warning. The wear rate of the main battery exceeds 90%. Please perform battery replacement maintenance immediately.』
Suddenly, Tipi started saying such things in a businesslike tone.
『Online exchange request to the service center is in progress -- the service center is offline. Retrying. -- The service center is offline. Retrying. -- The service center is offline. Retrying...』
"Siona, this is--!"
"I don't know the details, but Tipi-chan's battery seems to be unable to charge."
"Unable to charge..."
Is the voltage different? No, that shouldn't be a problem since it's going through the bear plushie.
Then, is there a problem with the battery itself?
If there's a possibility... could it be deterioration over time? Come to think of it, it's a battery that's been running for over 200 years.
It wouldn't be surprising if it's completely worn out.
"Maybe we need a new battery..."
"A brand new battery... Besides, I thought Tipi-chan's generation couldn't be replaced without a specialized technician disassembling it first...!"
"Oh no..."
Cold sweat runs down my back.
In other words, Tipi will stop functioning as is -- no, will she die?
"No way, we came all this way...!"
"It's okay... I knew this was going to happen."
Tipi's voice returns to its usual tone, and we can only stare as if struck by lightning.
"Tipi-chan, you knew this was going to happen, didn't you--"
"Yes... I thought this would happen since I left the library. I also noticed that the battery charging rate had been dropping since 6427 days ago."
Tipi answers with a weak smile.
"More importantly, Tipi has to do what Tipi can do... Rei, can you bring the metal briefcase Tipi had?"
"O-Okay!"
The slim but somewhat rugged metal briefcase that Tipi had been carrying since she left the library. I carry the heavier-than-expected case and bring it in front of Tipi.
Tipi casually places one hand in the middle of the briefcase. Just like that, the two locks on the handle side automatically unlock.
--Inside was a single black board. The size was about that of a slightly larger book. However, it was much thinner, only about half the size of a short picture book.
Tipi carefully takes it out with both hands and slowly turns to face me.
"Rei. Place your palm here. The non-mechanical one."
"Like this?"
As Tipi tells me, I place my non-prosthetic hand on the jet-black board. Then--.
A fluent male voice echoed from the black board.
"Current administrator, Vortex Company MSK-3737 model name 'Dorothy' individual name 'Tipi' approves the continuation of work. Continue the registration process."
『Confirmed. Registration applicant, please state the name to identify the individual.』
"Um... Rei."
『Understood. 《Rei》 has been registered as the new administrator. Please receive a verbal explanation of the usage method from the current administrator. That is all.』
The black board fell silent after saying that much.
"Tipi, what was that just now..."
"All the books that were in the library, digitized. It's a backup of Tipi's memory area."
Tipi answers in a slightly tired--yet somehow accomplished--tone.
I recall the many handwritten books that were lined up in the library.
Tipi, who remembered the words written there without missing a single one.
So, Tipi was the one who wrote those books after all.
Even if I were to stop someday... no, predicting that I would stop, so that I could leave a record of prehistoric civilization as a book.
That place wasn't just a library. Tipi herself was the library.
"When you use it, place your hand in the middle of the board, just like before. That will make the tablet—the board—light up. After that, you can call up all the data using the administrator's voice recognition function..."
"Then—"
As Tipi tells me, I activate the board she called a tablet. Just as instructed, I place my palm on it.
『Biometrics confirmed, administrator Rei authenticated. Which data would you like to load?』
"The manual! How to repair a Philoid... uh, how to replace the battery!"
『Initiating search... There are 3,195 items and 124,751 types of information related to Philoid repair methods. Narrowing down is recommended.』
"From those, Vortex Company MSK-3737 model 'Dorothy'."
『Initiating search... Conditions matched.』
The surface of the tablet glows brightly. Then, letters appear.
『Repair by the user is almost impossible. Please allow it to rest quietly until personnel from the service center arrive.』
The world before my eyes, darkened.
"How is it, is it working well?"
"Yeah, it's working... but..."
"That tablet... will only... work for about fifty years..."
It's more than enough time for me, but it probably isn't that long for a Philoid, or for the library's management system.
"Are you sure it's okay for me to use it?"
"Rather, use it. From now on... Tipi won't be useful anymore..."
"That's not true! Tipi has always been helping me!"
When I fixed Shiona's music box, when I fixed Mad's projector. All of that was possible because Tipi firmly remembered the library's collection and taught me.
"It makes me happy to hear you say that, Rei—from now on, please use this..."
Tipi, who had been sitting on the sofa, slowly lay down.
"Tipi!"
"Tipi-chan!"
I waited for two hundred years.
I can't let it end here.
Tipi's small mouth moves up and down, opening and closing.
It looks like she's saying something, but her voice is so small that it doesn't reach my ears.
I bring my ear closer to her mouth.
"Hey, Rei... Tipi, had fun."
Tipi's hand is placed on top of mine.
It's a small, soft hand.
"Rei is my father, and Shiona is my mother... Both of you are kind and a family I love so much."
No matter how coldly I treat them, no matter how much I push them away, I can't hide my true feelings.
Tipi had noticed.
How much we cherished Tipi.
From the moment we got involved, it was decided that Tipi would end up like this.
That there was nothing we could do about it.
That being alone all the time was the only way Tipi could survive.
But there's no way that's possible.
Tipi has emotions.
We're not perfect enough to overlook sadness.
No, that's not what you call perfect.
We are allowed to have emotions because we can feel sadness.
Slowly.
Like a handkerchief falling into the water and sinking, Tipi's eyes are closing.
Even though we created the Philoid, we can't even save her.
We just create them and then can't do anything about it.
Humans are truly selfish creatures.
"Hey, Shiona..."
Tipi's eyelids slowly opened again. But the light has already gone from her eyes. She probably can't see anymore.
"I'm here... I'm here, Tipi-chan..."
Shiona's voice was trembling slightly.
"I'm glad... Hey, Shiona."
"Yeah...?"
"Thank you for everything. You worked hard to keep Tipi from breaking, didn't you?"
"I think you realize, Tipi has been running for over two hundred years since she started operating... but her lifespan was originally only one hundred and fifty years. So, this isn't Shiona's or Rei's fault. It was meant to be..."
When Tipi left the library and came to the church, Shiona apologized to Tipi, and Tipi forgave her.
That's what that meant...
"So, please. Shiona, don't cry... Sing... sing a song..."
"Yeah... Yeah--!"
"Tipi... loves... Shiona's songs..."
Shiona started to sing a song. She occasionally sobbed, and her tune went off. Even so, Shiona continued to sing. To that melody--.
"Tha...nk... you..."
Tipi smiled--and then stopped moving.
My hand trembled.
Not just that.
My whole body was shaking.
Now, on my lap, another small life has come to an end.
People might say it's not a life.
But to me, it was an irreplaceable life.
Shiona quietly continues to sing.
The tune isn't off anymore. It's the same as always--but that song had a transparent resonance to it.
It was a melody dedicated to Tipi.
Something hot runs down my cheek.
It ran down my chin and fell on Tipi's cheek.
Even though Tipi isn't crying, she looks like she's crying.
I hugged Tipi close.
That small body will never move again.
That mouth will never make a sound again.
That hand will never draw a picture again.
That is 'death'.
Warmth spreads through my head.
Shiona was hugging me.
Suddenly, my eyes get hot.
This is overflowing emotion. An unbearable pain, an uncontrollable sadness... an immense grief.
For the first time in my life, I shed 'tears'.
Tears for Tipi--.
After that, our lives changed drastically.
The e-book terminal containing all the library's books that Tipi entrusted to me.
Thanks to what was once called a tablet, my knowledge increased rapidly.
How to grow crops, houses that can be made with just stones and mud, how to predict the weather, and the many animals and plants that can no longer be seen.
Furthermore, a database of newspapers covering the past 350 years until the library ceased functioning.
I'm sure if I searched, I could even find out about myself.
"Rei, are you studying again today?"
"Yeah. There are countless things I have to remember."
"What kind of book are you reading today?"
"Survival--how to survive in any environment."
The power supply to the cold sleep facility wasn't that great. If that's the case, then I need to be able to get by to some extent with just a small amount of power.
I've already started securing drinking water using morning and evening dew, and the problem of securing drinking water, which was the weakest point of this facility, is improving considerably.
That's right, from here on out, we won't be able to move forward by simply relying on physical strength like we used to.
What we need from now on is knowledge. With knowledge, we can face many people alone, or even avoid confronting them in the first place--or even win.
It might even become possible to help the people in town.
I greedily absorbed the "power" that Tipi left behind.
While I was reading, Shiona was singing beside Tipi, who had stopped moving.
Among the luggage we brought from town is Shiona's brother's music box.
Occasionally, instead of singing, she would turn the handle and play the music box's gentle melody.
It was a very peaceful and comforting time.
With my current "knowledge", it would be possible to live with Shiona in this place forever.
That's why... I didn't notice.
That there was something wrong with Shiona's body...
"Rei, dinner is ready."
Shiona prepares the meal with a smile, as always.
She dissolves the oral block in water, making it into a soup.
It's very similar to the orange, fluffy soup that Shiona always made for me in town.
"Thank you, this soup energizes me."
"I'm happy to hear you say that. It makes my heart orange."
"But, Shiona's soup, the portion is small?"
The amount of soup in the bowl is less than half of mine.
"I'm a Philoid, so if I go into save mode, this amount is enough."
"Is that so?"
"Yeah. That's why Rei needs to eat well. You won't have any energy if you get hungry, right?"
Ah... why couldn't I realize it?
At this time... her functions as a Philoid were already declining...
She was only operating at a level sufficient for half the amount of energy I was using.
As always, I read a book, and Shiona sang a song for me.
While tracing the surface of the tablet with my fingertip, I pondered if there was a way to free the people of the town.
Then, suddenly, the rhythm of the pleasantly flowing song stopped.
Wondering if something was wrong, I looked up to see Shiona frozen while holding her hand over her mouth.
The music box she was holding had also stopped.
"Shiona...? What's wrong?"
"Um... no, it's nothing. The song just..."
She said that and took a deep breath.
And then she starts singing again, but──
"...Huh? What was the pitch again...?"
"Shio...na...?"
"Hehe... that's strange, even though it's a song I loved so much, just wait a moment, I'll remember it soon..."
Shiona closed her eyes and tried to start singing again from the place where she had stopped many times.
But the melody flowing from her mouth was completely different from what I knew.
"What's wrong... I can't remember my brother's song..."
"Shiona!? Is there anything wrong with your body!?"
I was an idiot. In the end, I was only thinking about myself.
I was being kind to Shiona, being cherished, satisfied with that, and spoiled... I wasn't thinking about her.
Even though she was caught in an explosion that caused her to lose the artificial skin on her arm when we left town.
"Shiona! At the time of that explosion, you actually had a serious injury, didn't you!"
Shiona thought for a moment and then shook her head.
"I was okay then, yeah."
Shiona──Philoids don't lie.
But, she will hide words for the sake of humans.
Since she said she was okay, there must have been no damage from being caught in the explosion.
Just as she said──"then."
"...Shiona. Won't you show me what's wrong with you?"
"...Okay."
Urged by me, Shiona hesitated only once before nodding.
I tried to avert my eyes in embarrassment at the suddenness of it, but what was there wouldn't let my gaze go.
Shiona's white and firm chest.
There was a small hole there.
"That is..."
Forgetting that it was a woman's body, I approached the wound.
This is a gunshot wound.
I immediately remember when she protected me from the humans at Mad's shop.
"It hit you..."I said.
"I was wondering if I was okay, but it doesn't seem like it," Shiona said.
Shiona stuck out her tongue and smiled like a child caught doing something mischievous, but without showing any remorse.
I know that's a smile to keep me from feeling guilty.
Even at a time like this, she's thinking about me.
"...Hrk, search! MODA-117 Alice mk-17 Maintenance Manual!"
Reacting to my voice, the tablet glows faintly.
But Shiona covered the screen with her hand. And then slowly shook her head.
Without letting her smile fade.
"It's my body. I know it best."
"But... there might be a way! If you had told me sooner..."
──No, there's a reason she didn't say anything.
Shiona knew that she had a fatal injury that couldn't be fixed.
No matter how much I struggle, it's a reality that won't change.
It's something that's even too horrible to put into words.
The word 'death' floated into my head.
No matter how much I don't want to think about it, it just pops into my head.
"I know. I'm going to die soon. Since I'm a Philoid, should I say 'break down'?"
No, Shiona.
You're not going to break down.
You're going to die.
"Hehe, I guess I'm a little out of it, I can't put any strength into my body..."
Just as I thought her shoulders slumped, Shiona fell straight to the floor.
"Shiona!"
I hurriedly caught her and held her in a position that was as comfortable as possible.
How long has she been like this?
Why couldn't I realize it...?
"Breaking down... does that mean I'll stop being me...? But, can it be fixed...?"
"It's okay... Shiona is Shiona..."
"Hehe... you know, I'm... a little scared right now..."
"Shiona... Shiona...!"
"Don't cry, Rei. Tippy-chan will laugh at you if you do."
Shiona's hand reaches out to my cheek.
It was my second tear that she brushed away with her fingertip.
"I don't want Rei to be blue... I always want you to be orange and fluffy..."
Sad.
An overwhelming sadness wells up.
It multiplies infinitely in my heart, never ceasing.
As time passes, that sadness becomes more intense.
Why am I so sad?
That answer comes immediately.
Because you're important.
You were important to me.
Even if a Philoid with the same appearance appeared before me, it wouldn't mean anything.
It doesn't matter if you look different.
As long as your essence is still you.
"Rei... you know, I thought of you as family. It's partly because you resembled my older brother, but it's not just that. I thought you were important,"
Family.
That is, beings who can believe in and help each other selflessly, without any benefit.
That is 'love'.
The emotion I had unknowingly craved.
I had realized that emotion without noticing.
It had been given to me all along... all along.
It's an emotion that's too natural in life, as you walk alongside someone.
"What's wrong, Rei... don't make such a sad face... That's right, let's sing a song, let's go to the plaza again... everyone will be happy."
"...Shiona...?"
"It's something I promised everyone. Rei gave everyone a smile, made them feel happy."
Those are memories of happier times. Memories of the fun days we spent in town.
It's probably a confusion of memory areas.
But...
"...That's right, let's sing. Everyone's looking forward to it."
I turned the handle of the music box that was placed on the floor.
The melody quietly begins to flow.
Shiona's cheeks soften, and she closes her eyes and begins to sing.
I also close my eyes, listen to the melody, and reminisce.
It wasn't a long time, but I recall the scenery of that town I spent time in.
People walking down the street stop and turn to look at us.
One by one, they gather in the plaza.
Children, the elderly, someone's mother, her husband, the townspeople all begin to smile.
As if intoxicated by Shiona's singing melody.
Surely that scene was commonplace in the distant past.
Humans and Philoids alike, smiling, spending time together, supporting each other.
The commonplace things that we have forgotten... that we have lost...
"Hey, Rei... always, always be smiling, okay?"
"...Yeah."
"It's okay to be sad, it's okay to be angry... but... after that, smile."
"Hey... if love has a shape, it's definitely round. Because love never hurts anyone."
I hold back my tears and smile.
"Hey... if love has a temperature, it's definitely warm. Because love warms you up as if enveloping you."
"Yeah... I'm sure it does."
"Because there's love, Rei isn't sad. Because love is something that protects, and it won't hurt Rei. I promise. No matter what happens from now on, our love will protect Rei."
I had cried so much that my eyes were starting to hurt.
My vision blurred.
But even through that, I could see Shiona's smile clearly.
"So don't cry. Love is always by your side. Love is eternal. You don't have to cry. Because it's eternal."
I placed my hand over Shiona's hand, which was resting on my cheek.
It was warm, but she had hardly any strength left.
It was as if something was spilling out from between our fingers.
I knew what was spilling out.
But I didn't want to admit it.
I gripped her hand tightly, wishing that it wouldn't spill out.
I can hear a song.
A warm melody that Shiona always hummed.
It seeped into the gaps in my darkening heart, filling it with warmth.
"I'm sorry, for leaving you alone again."
"--! That's not true. That's not true!"
I wanted to tear at my own hair.
Now, I finally realized.
Shiona wasn't afraid of breaking. She was afraid of me being alone again.
"I... I received so much from Shiona... so much...!"
"Rei?"
I held Shiona's mechanical hand with my human hand.
That's right, until I met Shiona, I was neither human nor Philoid, just stuck in between.
Shiona stayed by my side all that time--and I became human.
"Shiona is always inside me, I'm not alone anymore. Joy, sadness, anger... I received it all from you. I'll never forget it."
Ah... damn it, I have to smile here.
I have to reassure Shiona, but my emotions won't allow it...
No matter how hard I try, tears spill out from the surging sadness.
"So Shiona, don't make such a sad face. I'll be okay. I'll definitely be okay."
"I see... then, I'm glad."
Shiona nodded, looking satisfied.
"Huh..."
Shiona narrowed her eyes as if confused. Then, as if pushed out from her eyelids, transparent droplets began to cover her eyes.
"That's probably different..."
I said in a trembling voice, smiling to reassure Shiona.
Now that I've become human, I understand the meaning of those tears.
Shiona seemed to realize it too, and smiled back at me.
"Tears... they also flow when you're happy, right?"
The strength slowly drained from Shiona's body.
Am I smiling? Am I?
Am I able to keep smiling, so that Shiona won't be worried?
"...See you later, okay?"
"...Yeah, see you later."
Suddenly,
Shiona closed her eyes.
In that instant, Shiona had probably the most beautiful face I had ever seen.
And then, Shiona never opened her eyes again.
That peaceful face looks like she's smiling.
As if she's praying for my happiness.
But there's no happiness in a world without Shiona.
My life that will continue from now on is hell itself.
Can I endure it?
...No, I have to endure it.
My chest tightens so much it hurts.
All my emotions creak and groan as they run through my body.
Is my heart really this fragile and weak?
Is losing someone precious really this painful?
"Ugh... Aah...!!"
My vision turned pure white, and I cried out, as if to destroy that world.
"Aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh... !"
Shiona said it.
Certainly, Shiona's love may be eternal.
But I couldn't endure it.
I know, this is emotion.
What Shiona gave me.
This pain, this sorrow.
But that's not all.
The warmth barely remaining in my chest, and the memories of everyone that I can proudly say were fun.
Shiona gave me all of that too.
Both of them are mine now.
I'll never let go of either.
How much time has passed?
How much time do humans need to sort out their feelings?
I... I kept remembering the time I met Shiona, over and over again.
The meals we ate together.
Waking up in the morning and exchanging greetings.
The times we went shopping together.
The time I went to the abandoned factory and made her worry.
The time she was so happy when the music box was fixed.
Singing in the town square, surrounded by smiles.
I made a promise... .
I learned warmth.
I learned joy.
There were times I felt anger.
There were times I shed tears of sorrow.
And... I received love.
──No... everything was love.
This tragedy was brought about by the foolishness of us humans, who lost that love.
Humans are hopelessly selfish.
They repeat the same mistakes... .
Even so, they will need someone.
It's instinct. Even when I woke up here, I wanted to see a human.
It's the instinct to seek love, to want to walk alongside someone.
And we can't even realize something so simple... .
I look at the cold sleep devices in front of me.
I had Shiona and Tipi sleeping in the few that were still left and functioning properly.
They were originally for humans, but this should help suppress aging to some extent.
I wanted to preserve their appearance, even just a little.
Standing before the two who look as if they are only sleeping, I mutter.
"Shiona, Tipi... I'm going now."
There's no reply.
There couldn't be.
But I continued.
"I'm going on a journey now. Don't worry, it's not a journey without a purpose. I'm going to find a world where humans and Philoids can coexist."
That was also the wish spoken by that excluded human youth.
If there was a world where humans and Philoids could coexist, this kind of sorrow wouldn't happen.
If there was a world where humans and Philoids could coexist, there would be no greater joy.
That's why I'm going to look for it now.
"And if that world doesn't exist──"
I clench my iron fist as if covering it with my bare palm.
"──No, it definitely exists. The world that you tried to leave for us humans definitely exists."
Finding it will be extremely difficult.
But I have the knowledge that Tipi gave me.
And I have the emotions that Shiona gave me.
I have a partner in this world who continues to convey "love."
So, this journey from now on is not a journey of despair.
"I'll borrow this, okay? I'll come back to return it someday."
In my hand is Shiona's brother's music box.
I turn the handle in front of the sleeping Shiona, and the melody of peace that is packed inside resonates.
In time with that melody, I felt like I could hear her song.
"Well then, I'm off."
A world where humans and Philoids can hold hands and walk together... .
I took that first step.
"Even so, I remained hopeful and continued to reach both arms toward the light."
"Are you awake?"
"...Where... am I...?"
"You've awakened from a long sleep. Do you remember your name?"
My name is... .
"I am Asou International, MODA-117 Alice mk-17. My individual name has not been set."
"It seems the settings have been initialized. For now, Alice will do."
The man in front of me held out an old-fashioned wooden box.
"What's this...?"
"It was inside the device you were sleeping in."
I take the box. It felt very nostalgic.
When I opened the lid, there was a dull golden disc. When I turned the handle coming out of the side of the box, a clear tone began to play.
A very beautiful melody flowing as the metal comb is gently plucked.
"It's a song that's been played since long ago."
A melody that isn't in my records.
But even so, it's very nostalgic, warm, and makes my chest feel all fuzzy.
And at the same time... .
Hot tears are spilling from my eyes.
"Emotional function runaway detected. Maintenance may be required."
"No, that won't be necessary. You should cherish those emotions. ...Only the knowledge was left behind, but it took a long time to recover the technology to utilize it. I'm sorry."
The man speaks to me gently.
I feel a nostalgic familiarity in his expression.
It's not in the records… …My memories…
"Alright. Let's go home after we finish the basic maintenance."
"Where to?"
"To town."
The outside of the facility was dazzling.
The sky is blue and endlessly high. White clouds drift slowly, drawing various shapes.
Warm air filled my artificial lungs. A gentle breeze softly caresses my hair.
It was a natural sight.
For some reason, I feel nostalgic for this ordinary world.
And… for some reason, I feel very sad.
We drive along the paved road.
Every scene visible from the window is beautiful.
Lush greenery abounds.
Small fish leap on the surface of a clear stream.
In the sky, small birds chirp and fly together harmoniously.
"Alright, we're here."
Passing through the gate, we arrive at a town surrounded by white walls.
It was overflowing with many people.
Humans and Phylloids alike, holding hands, living ordinary lives.
That sight makes my eyes well up again.
"Excuse me, there is still a risk of emotional function runaway. My chest rhythm pattern is also not within normal values."
"It's alright. I'm sure it's the right thing."
"Is that so? In that case, am I a defective product?"
"No, you're perfectly normal. You're closer to a human than any other Phylloid."
As a Phylloid, those words make me very happy.
But I don't understand why he says that.
I gaze intently at the town that I feel nostalgic for.
In a corner of the square, a human child and a child-shaped Phylloid are playing happily.
That's a photo studio. The Phylloid owner is smiling as he takes pictures of a human family.
At a general store a little further away, a human is shopping, and the Phylloid owner is dealing with them in an unfriendly manner.
"Sensei, welcome back!"
A very cute little girl Phylloid runs towards me.
"Hello, I'm back. Have you been a good girl, Dorothy?"
"Yes! I drew lots of pictures while Sensei was gone. Look!"
The little girl shows me the picture she drew with a beaming smile.
The townspeople are in a circle, laughing.
The picture drawn with crayons is very warm, and just looking at it makes my heart feel warm.
It was a picture that made everyone who saw it feel happy.
"Huh? You are..."
The girl looks up at me.
"Nice to meet you. I'm Alice, nice to meet you."
"Ali...ce? Hello Alice. Dorothy is Dorothy because she is not registered."
"Yes, me too."
An unregistered Phylloid. What should I do if I don't have a primary partner?
Perhaps sensing my anxiety, the man next to me patted me on the shoulder.
"What would you like to do?"
"...What can I do...?"
"Alice, can you sing a song?"
"Yes, a song. Like this."
Dorothy closes her eyes and begins to sing.
It was a little clumsy, but it was a song I recognized.
"It's a song that has been sung since long, long ago. There's no one in the world who doesn't know it."
The man says so and takes out a music box from the car.
He opens the lid and turns the handle protruding from the side of the box.
Clear sounds are plucked, and a gentle melody begins to flow.
As if drawn to the melody, the townspeople gather.
Everyone listens to the tone and their expressions become gentle.
I know this scene.
The memory that breathes softly in the deeper part of the memory area that should be pure white gently taps my heart.
My mouth moved naturally.
The song that I should be singing for the first time was familiar to my throat, my lips... my heart.
The music box melody filling the square is very nostalgic.
"Wow, it's so beautiful. You're so good!"
"Yes, this song is... a very important song."
