The air shifted.
The pale light that had been enveloping me until now receded.
What I saw then was a grimy ceiling.
My right arm, which I extended towards that place, was slightly different from my left arm, which I also extended.
My right arm is made of exposed mechanical parts from the wrist down.
My fingers move smoothly, but each time, a small scraping metallic sound echoes.
Then, I slowly raised my upper body.
From that, I could tell that the identity of the pale light that had been in my field of vision until just now was an oval-shaped lid with a gentle curve.
It seems I was asleep inside this capsule-like thing.
Where is this?
Who am I?
Why am I here?
Even if I ask myself, I can't find the answer.
Even if I try to trace back my memories, all I have is the memory of pale light.
In order to find a clue to my memories, I decided to get out of the capsule and wander around the room.
Even though I know the act of walking, perhaps it has been a long time since I did it, as my footing is unsteady.
I paid attention not to fall and slowly moved forward.
The drifting air was lukewarm, and every time I took air into my lungs, dust clung to my throat.
Outside light was shining through a hole in the ceiling, revealing dust in the air along the beam.
Probably, no one has entered this building for quite some time.
A thin layer of dust spreads across the floor.
What is this place for, I wonder?
Countless oval capsules were scattered around the large room.
Most of them are open.
The insides are empty.
Even if some are closed, there's nothing inside.
It seems I'm the only one in this room.
…No, that's not exactly true.
There are people who exist, leaning against the oval objects or lying on the floor.
But, no, that's not right.
Those aren't exactly people.
It would be more accurate to call them humanoid objects.
Those humanoid objects had mechanical parts peeking out from under their skin.
Some had mechanical parts from the neck up.
Some had exposed mechanical arms.
Some had their lower bodies torn off, revealing mechanical parts.
And then I remembered what those humanoid objects were.
Philoids, made for humans, human partners.
Equipped with the five senses, and even emotions, they are the closest existence to humans.
I reach out to a Philoid that has stopped functioning.
The bare hand, not covered in skin, looked exactly like my right hand.
This is a factory.
I was made here.
...But the facility must have been abandoned for some reason just before completion.
I stare at my mechanical right hand, before it was covered with artificial skin, and conclude the most likely possibility.
Having understood my own existence, I started walking towards the wall.
There was an old automatic door, and right next to it, a liquid crystal panel displaying 《CLOSE》 was covered in dust.
I touched it with my mechanical hand.
The moment I felt something cold like electricity at my bloodless fingertips, it displayed 《OPEN》 and the door opened.
Can I get out of here?
Is anyone left in this facility?
I wanted to meet someone.
I wanted to meet a human.
Let's go find them, my partner.
I pushed open the door leading outside.
In order to prove my own existence.
When I got home, I headed straight for the living room.
There was a broken music box there.
I unraveled a book I borrowed from the library and learned about its structure.
As I thought, the gears inside were chipped.
So no matter how much I turn the handle, the disc won't spin and no sound will come out.
...But what should I do about this gear?
Would it be possible to make it to the size written in the book? No, impossible.
With no answer in sight, I continued turning the pages of the book.
At the end of the book, there was a list of products for each manufacturer, and a list of parts used.
As I skimmed through it, my gaze caught on something.
What I learned there was that the manufacturer that made this music box also made clocks.
If that's the case, then the parts for the precision parts might be the same as those used in clocks.
Suddenly, I remembered what I broke at Mad's shop.
That clock... if they're going to throw it away because it's unusable...
If I use the gears and other parts from the clock, I might be able to fix the music box.
"Ray, what are you doing?"
At the same time as I saw the possibility of repair, Shiona came into the living room.
"Shiona, listen. I might be able to fix the music box with the parts from the clock that was at Mad's shop."
"Really? Really?"
Shiona had an even more joyful smile than usual.
From that expression, I could understand Shiona's joy.
"But don't push yourself too hard. Even without the music box, we can still sing."
Shiona picked up the music box and started singing.
That song she sang in the chapel.
That song, somehow nostalgic.
That song, that warms the depths of my heart.
Looking at Shiona, who gazes fondly at the music box, my resolve grows stronger.
I want to fix this music box for her.
And I want to make Shiona happy.
That feeling swells within me.
"Tomorrow, I'm going to Mad's shop again."
I'll try to ask if they can let me have the clock somehow.
But there was one thing that worried me.
That is, that I was the one who broke the clock.
I apologized, but it's still hard to go there.
I'm terrified of Mad-san yelling at me again.
"You know, I want to make a lot of people smile with this song, Onii-chan."
Shiona's words reached me, who was hesitating.
"This song is orange... I'm sure it can turn many people's hearts orange. Because it's a song made with the wish that it would. Because that's Onii-chan's wish. So, I want many people to hear this song. And I want to make many people smile. That's my wish."
Shiona said as if to herself.
Those words pushed me forward.
I'll go to Mad's shop again tomorrow.
And I'll apologize again for breaking the clock.
With Shiona's singing and the music box, I strengthened my resolve.
The next day, I visited Mad-san's shop alone.
I can't count how many times I thought about turning back on the way.
Each time, Shiona's smile would flash through my mind.
I want to keep seeing that smile.
To do that, I want to fix the music box for her.
I recalled my resolve from yesterday over and over.
What I can do for Shiona.
I steeled myself and stepped into Mad-san's shop.
"What kind of face do you think you can show here?"
Immediately after, Mad-san's voice, as low as distant thunder, rained down.
I wanted to run away immediately, but I didn't.
"I wanted to apologize more sincerely for yesterday."
"About the clock? You already apologized for that."
"Shiona was there at the time... I thought I should apologize properly, by myself."
"I don't need that. Get out of here."
"I can't do that. I'm truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday."
"No matter how much you apologize, the clock is still broken. Get out."
"I'm sorry. I'm really sorry."
With my head bowed, I continued to apologize.
I wonder how much time had passed.
Eventually, Mad-san's voice, a little softer, reached me.
"...Raise your head."
Doing as I was told, Mad-san's face, looking somewhat exasperated, was there.
"Jeez... what a guy. You're persistent beyond belief."
"I'm sorry..."
"Don't apologize anymore, or I'll punch you!"
He said that, but there didn't seem to be as much anger as yesterday.
I thought I heard a small sigh.
"You're done here, right? Get out of here."
"Um... there's one thing I wanted to ask."
"A request? You've got some nerve asking me for a favor."
The pressure made my legs tremble, but Shiona's words pushed me forward.
"That clock... could you let me have it?"
"...Say that again."
"Um... that clock from yesterday, could you let me have it--"
"Are you kidding meeeeeeeeeee!!"
The impact was like being struck by lightning, and I froze stiffly at attention.
"You broke it yourself and now you want me to give it to you? Don't get cocky!"
It's no use... .
I can't take any more than this...
As I tried to run away, a voice called out from behind.
"Please wait, Mad-san. Rei only wants to fix my brother's music box."
Shiona, who should have been waiting at home, was there.
Unafraid of Mad-san, Shiona stepped between him and me.
"My brother's music box is broken, and Rei said he would fix it for me. He only needs the parts for that. He's truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday. So, won't you forgive him?"
Shiona told Mad-san with an unwavering smile.
"Hmm... Hmmm..."
Mad-san's face was bright red, but his expression gradually softened.
"But, that clock is gone now. I threw that thing away. However..."
Mad-san turned his back to us, but continued to speak.
"I threw it away at the abandoned factory on the edge of town. I don't know what happened after that."
After saying only that, Mad-san sat down facing the wall.
"Mad-san, thank you very much."
Shiona bowed without losing her smile and left the store.
"Ah, thank you very much..."
I bowed in the same way and left the store.
"The abandoned factory is very close to where Rei collapsed."
Shiona told me as soon as we left the store.
"Are you saying Shiona goes to throw away trash there?"
"That's right. Trash from various places gathers there."
"So, are you fixing up things you find there and selling them here?"
"That's right. Mad-san often goes to that place."
I see, that's why there were so many old things in the store.
He must be bringing usable things from that place and reusing them.
In any case, I decided to head to that abandoned factory.
"Shiona, if you don't mind, I'd like you to guide me to that place."
"I'm sorry, the Red Children are supposed to come to my house today."
She must be talking about those children who were talking to Shiona yesterday.
Come to think of it, she promised to treat them to soup.
"But Rei, you can't go alone, right? I'll go and cancel my promise with the children."
"No, it's okay, Shiona. You should keep your promise."
"But, how are you going to get there?"
"I'll try going to the library. I want to know more about this area, and I want to look at a map."
"The library..."
Shiona's expression seemed to cloud over slightly.
"Eh... No, it's nothing. ...Hey, Rei. Is Tippy-chan fond of Rei?"
"I wonder. I don't think she hates me, but why do you ask?"
"No, it's nothing. If it's the library, I'm sure there's a map. Goodbye."
"Yeah, I will. Well then, see you later."
I turned on my heel and tried to head to the library.
The smile Shiona showed at that time seemed to contain some sadness, I thought.
But I don't know the reason why.
"Rei, you came."
Tippy was crying in the same place as yesterday, in the same way.
"Yeah, I came. Hey Tippy, can I ask you something?"
"Does this library have a map of the town?"
"Yeah, it does. Lots of them."
"That's good. Will you guide me to where the maps are?"
"I don't mind... but..."
Tippy was somehow hesitant.
"No, that's not it... that's not it, but..."
"Will you hold me?"
Tippy's face turned a little red.
Her sad expression hasn't changed, but her cheeks seem a little softer.
"...Hold you? You mean, like I did yesterday?"
"Yeah... is it no good?"
"It's not no good. Here, come here."
"Yeah... yeah..."
When I opened my arms, Tippy stood up and jumped into my chest, somewhat hesitantly.
Unlike yesterday, I'm holding her in my arms.
But my feelings are the same.
The Tippy I held was still small, soft, and seemed like she would break.
"Tippy, is this okay?"
"Yeah, it's okay. Rei... you're warm."
Tippy nuzzled my chest.
That gesture warmed the depths of my heart.
Could this be the feeling of love?
I want to protect this girl.
I want to stop these tears.
For a while, I held Tippy close.
"Um, can you walk over there like this?"
Tippy pointed her finger towards the aisle from within my arms.
Still holding her, I headed in the direction she indicated.
"Why do you need a map?"
"Apparently, there's an abandoned factory near the town. I want to go there."
"Why, to the abandoned factory?"
"Because the parts I'm looking for might be there."
"The music box you were looking at yesterday?"
"Yeah, that's right. I really want to fix Shiona's brother's music box for her."
"Shiona's... I see. I hope you find it."
Still in my arms, Tippy led me without hesitation to the bookshelf containing the map books.
"Do you remember where each book is, by any chance?"
"Yeah, mostly."
"That's amazing... Did someone teach you?"
"Nope. I learned by myself while waiting for Papa and Mama."
Tippy teared up a little when she said the words "Papa and Mama."
"Um... is this it?"
I took out a map book to change the subject.
I sat down on the spot and opened the book.
Like the music box book, this map was also handwritten.
Could it be that all the books in this library are handwritten?
If so, that's a considerable amount.
Who on earth would handwrite this many books?
The task would take an endless amount of time, it makes my head spin.
"It's pretty beat up... How old is this book?"
"Um... I don't know. It's a really, really, reeeeally old book."
It seemed like a map from decades ago.
The buildings themselves seem to be the same as the current townscape, though...
The pages are badly faded, like tea was spilled on them.
Some of them were stuck together and looked like they would tear if I turned them.
I carefully turned the page.
"Ah, could this be it?"
I found a factory symbol to the north of the town.
Judging from the direction of Shiona's house, this is likely the place.
"Rei... are you going? Don't go..."
Tippy clung to my neck.
I stroked her small back with my hand many times.
"It's okay, I'll come back."
"Really? Will you really come back?"
"Yeah, of course. I promise."
"You promise? You absolutely, absolutely have to come back!"
"Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely."
Again and again, I made promises with Tippy.
I wonder why.
Even so, I hesitated to leave.
The feeling that I want to stay by Tippy's side forever is welling up inside me.
Hiding that feeling, I left the library.
Relying on the map, I entered the abandoned factory and was assaulted by the smell of oxidized oil.
This factory must have originally made Philoid arms and legs.
All around, unfinished Philoid arm and leg parts were scattered everywhere.
All of them are before being covered with artificial skin, with the machine parts exposed.
Looking closely, I can see that they are made the same way as my right hand.
Even knowing they are artificial, this sight was bizarre.
To move the arm that was rolling around, I pushed it away with my right hand.
The mournful sound of metal clashing echoed throughout the factory.
If, by some chance, any part of my body breaks, I'll come here.
If it's here, there are mountains of alternative parts.
In the back, there were many drums filled with oxidized oil rolling around.
Most of it has oxidized, but there was also some unopened oil inside.
Even if the oil runs out, I can perform maintenance here without being seen.
The further I went into the factory, the more the worries I had in the back of my mind were resolved.
This abandoned factory should become an important place for me.
But, I can't find the most important thing.
That is, of course, the watch that Mad discarded in this place.
But, inside this factory, there isn't even anything that looks like trash, let alone a watch.
Could it be that the trash was thrown outside instead of inside the factory?
I left the factory once and decided to go around its perimeter.
Then, on the back side of the factory, I was able to find an area where machine parts were piled high.
There are machine parts, of course, but also a lot of trash is thrown away.
Surely this town's garbage dump is here.
Besides Mad, there must be others who have taken things that could be used from here.
Looking up at the mountain that was many times my height, I thought about that.
"...Now then, where could it be?"
There's a considerable amount of trash.
It would be a lot of work to search diligently and find it.
But, there's no other way.
I decided to start searching from my feet right away.
I don't know how much time has passed.
I lost my sense of time a long time ago.
Because I was moving muddy metal plates and containers covered in waste oil, my hands were filthy.
My clothes were covered in oil, and before I knew it, there were a lot of stains.
After that, I crossed a carpet of garbage, swam in a river of filth, and was hit by a waterfall of scrap.
And then, I finally found it.
It was in Mad's shop.
The one I broke yesterday.
That watch.
I picked it up and stared intently at the hands on the dial.
Of course, it's not moving.
I put it to my ear, but it didn't make any sound.
It's only natural since I broke it.
I guess this watch will never tick again.
That fact pricked the depths of my heart slightly.
Gently, I hugged the watch and decided to start heading home.
Shiona will greet me kindly.
"I'm home. I found it."
When I held out the oil-stained trophy, Shiona smiled gently.
"Really, thank you. Here, change your clothes, change your clothes."
Shiona had prepared a towel and a change of clothes for me.
After wiping off the dirt and changing, I headed to the living room.
Shiona greeted me there as well.
"Ray, you must be tired? Eat and rest."
"No, I'm okay. I want to get to work right away."
"Are you okay? I'm worried about your body, Ray."
"I'm fine. For some reason, I don't feel tired right now."
"But, you have to eat..."
"Yeah, I know. I'll eat later, so you go ahead and eat."
"...Okay, I understand. Good luck."
Shiona leaves the living room.
I watched her go, and then I started working.
I opened the book I borrowed from the library beside me.
This music box has a mechanism inside where gears of various sizes intricately mesh together when the handle is turned, keeping the disc rotating at a constant speed.
Apparently, turning it faster doesn't necessarily make the song play faster.
I thought that was an amazing piece of technology.
Following the assembly instructions written in the book in reverse order, I disassembled the music box.
Then, as I compared the parts one by one to check if any were missing, I found that a gear in the power transmission section was broken.
So, even with something that moves with such precision, it only takes one small part to fail for it to stop working.
I couldn't help but look at my right hand.
For now, I'll try to find a gear from the watch that's the same size as this broken one.
I then began disassembling the watch.
I removed the lid and used a screwdriver to remove the screws.
When I removed the cover, the internal structure was revealed.
Gears much more precise than those in the music box meshed together in multiple layers.
One of them, a slightly larger gear, had a broken axle. That's why the parts wouldn't turn.
I must have broken this part yesterday.
The fact that Mad-san threw this watch away probably means he didn't have a part the same size as this gear.
Fortunately, the broken gear wasn't the size needed for the music box.
Disassembling things makes me feel somewhat hesitant.
Because I'm breaking this watch to fix the music box.
Perhaps it's because I understand for myself what kind of existence I am.
Hesitantly, but as a small offering, I disassembled the watch as carefully as possible.
I lined up the watch gears on the table, starting with the smallest, and compared them to the ones from the music box.
"...Found it."
I was able to find a gear that seemed to be almost the same size.
All that's left is to transplant this into the music box according to the book.
"I think this should work..."
The disc should move without any problems now.
I put the lid back on and turned the handle, and there was a response.
But the handle won't turn any further.
I wonder why.
I reread the book.
There are no problems with the parts or the positions they're assembled in.
Tilting my head, I removed the lid again.
Then, I tried turning the handle as it was.
Certainly, the gears meshed together perfectly.
But it seems the oil has completely dried up because it hasn't been used for a while.
That must be the reason why the handle won't turn.
What should I do?
Should I go to Shiona and borrow some cooking oil?
...No, that's also a problem.
Cooking oil and gear lubricant are probably different types.
It might work at first, but it could cause a breakdown.
Then, what should I do...?
Suddenly, I looked at my right hand.
Although it's covered by a glove, underneath are bare mechanical parts.
What about using the oil used in my hand?
I took off my glove and carefully examined my right hand.
Exposed mechanical parts.
Oil is built inside to smoothly move those parts.
I inserted a screwdriver into the palm near the base of my thumb.
When I removed the exterior, it was packed with mechanisms such as wiring, cylinders, and shafts to move the mechanical hand.
One of the cylinders inside contains oil.
And it was detachable so that the old oil could be easily replaced.
I removed the cylinder with my left hand and dripped the oil that filled it onto the gears of the music box.
I spread the oil with my fingertips so that it would blend into all the gears as much as possible.
I wonder if it will work?
I returned the cylinder to my right hand and reattached the exterior.
Hiding the mechanical arm with a glove, I cautiously turned the handle as it was.
Clumsily at first. But as I turned the handle, the gears ran smoothly.
The oil must have circulated through all the gaps in the gears, and the handle continued to turn without any snag.
And that melody begins to play.
"Rei, that song...!"
Shiona suddenly came into the room.
"Yeah. It's fixed, Shiona."
"Thank you... thank you, Rei. Thank you... I'm so, so happy."
Shiona showed me a smile I had never seen before.
Just looking at that smile, the depths of my heart warmed up.
And then, I realized.
Ah, so this is it.
This is the emotion called happiness.
I am happy now.
I am happy to see Shiona's smile.
And, for the first time, I was able to feel that I had been useful.
"Thank you, Rei, thank you."
Shiona took my hand and thanked me many times.
As her face got closer, I felt my face getting hot.
"Thanks to Rei's hard work, the music box is fixed. I can listen to that song again, which I had given up on. This orange-colored song that my brother made. This song that I love so much..."
"Hey, Shiona, sing it. Let me hear your brother's song."
"Yes... of course!"
I turn the handle of the music box.
Shiona clasped her hands in front of her chest and began to sing along with the melody.
The song she was singing when we met.
The song Shiona's brother made.
An orange-colored song.
I feel like I understand its meaning now.
The emotion dwelling in my heart is joy.
Shiona's song.
And Shiona, singing so happily.
Just watching her, I was overflowing with joy.
More than usual, Shiona seemed so happy as she sang that song.
That day, Shiona kept singing until she fell asleep.
I was also captivated by her singing voice and the tone of the music.
Over and over, Shiona asked me to play the song.
Shiona kept singing until my arm could no longer move.
Looking at her expression, I think.
I want to be with Shiona like this forever.
If Shiona wishes for it, I can be with her forever.
But for that to happen, my true identity must never be revealed.
Never, absolutely never...
That day, I solidified my resolve to stay with Shiona forever.
Night, in the darkened room.
On the two beds placed side by side, Shiona speaks to me.
"Will you listen to my request?"
"You see, I want many people to hear this song. And I want to make them smile. I want to make many people happy with this song that my brother made."
I only know the word.
But I didn't know what it was.
Is it a state?
Or is it an emotion?
I repeat the word 'happiness' over and over in my head.
"So, I want you to help me."
"Help? How should I do it?"
"Tomorrow, I want you to go to the plaza with me. And I want you to play the music box."
"And then, Shiona will sing, right?"
"Yes, that's right. And I want as many people as possible to hear it. The orange-colored song that my brother made..."
"Yeah, I want to do that too. Of course, I'll help."
I heard the sound of the sheets rubbing together.
"What's wrong, Shiona?"
"Hey, Rei... can I hold your hand?"
I can't see Shiona's expression in the dark.
But I feel like Shiona's face is turning red.
"Hand? With me?"
"Yeah, I want to hold your hand, Rei... is that... no good...?"
I search through my knowledge.
I know the act of holding hands.
But what it means for a boy and girl of a certain age...
"No, it's fine..."
If I'm being asked by a human... by Shiona, then I want to respond.
Fortunately, she's on my left side.
If it's the hand covered in artificial skin, I don't think there'll be a problem.
I reach my hand out to the bed next to mine.
In the cold room, my outstretched hand was a little chilly.
I search for Shiona's hand in the air.
Touching, warmth.
Shiona's hand overlapped with mine.
"You're warm, Rei."
"Yeah... you're warm, Shiona."
We held hands.
Without either of us initiating, our fingers intertwined.
Not just warmth from our hands, but a different kind of warmth spread.
Is this the warmth of a human, different from my artificial warmth...?
"Rei... tighter, please."
"...Like this...?"
"Sorry, did that hurt?"
"No... it was just stronger than I expected."
"Is this strength okay?"
"Yeah... thank you, Rei."
We held hands all night long.
Until the morning woke us, our hands remained connected.
The next day, the plaza was filled with sound.
The melody that Shiona and I began to play.
Shiona sang.
I turned Shiona's older brother's music box.
At first, there was no one around.
But as if drawn by Shiona's singing voice, the number of people increased.
One, two people stopped, and soon a small circle formed.
That circle quickly grew larger, and the deserted plaza was soon bustling with activity.
Everyone there was listening intently to Shiona's singing.
A young couple snuggled close, each holding the other's hand.
An old man closed his eyes with deep emotion.
A young man gazed at a woman a little ways away.
A young parent and child laughed joyfully together.
The children were moving their bodies to the rhythm of the song.
Each person was listening to Shiona's song with their own thoughts.
But there was one thing they all had in common.
That was that everyone was 'smiling'.
Everyone was smiling as they listened to Shiona's song.
I felt a warmth deep in my chest, feeling that I was helping to bring smiles to the faces of the people in this place.
This is the emotion of happiness.
The feeling I felt yesterday when I saw Shiona's smile.
This is what it was.
I am happy.
I felt my cheeks lift slightly.
Surely, I'm smiling too.
It might be a slightly awkward-looking smile.
But that's okay.
If I can get even a little closer to Shiona, I'll be satisfied with just that.
The music box, which I had just repaired, continued to play the melody without a hitch.
The turning handle is also in good condition.
The sound flowing from the disc resonates and amplifies inside the wooden box, becoming a clear tone that goes outside.
According to Shiona, it's an orange-colored melody.
Shiona sings along with that melody.
I wished this time could last forever and ever.
This time where we can make people smile.
And I wanted to keep watching Shiona's happy profile as she sang, forever and ever.
Suddenly, my gaze turned towards the library on the edge of town.
I thought I saw the closed curtains sway slightly.
For a moment, I even saw a small figure.
I know who it is.
That blue girl who's always crying.
It's Tippy.
She's probably still crying now.
In that lonely library--.
Just thinking about it made a small ache in my chest.
It felt like a thorn had pierced me.
What kind of feelings did Tippy have as she watched this circle?
A circle of smiles that continues to expand.
Everyone there was smiling and sharing the same feelings.
I noticed that there was one person with a scowl on their face.
That person with the hunched shoulders and folded arms is Mad.
He was so out of place, with only him showing the emotion of 'anger' on his face.
I suddenly made eye contact with Mad, who held that emotion that I still didn't know.
It's a time shorter than a second.
Mad harrumphed, turned on his heel, and disappeared into the crowd.
Watching him, I thought.
I want to make everyone smile.
The two people expressing sadness and anger.
I want to make Tippy and Mad smile.
But, what should I do?
While turning the handle of the music box, I kept thinking about that.
After the song ended, I headed to Mad's shop alone.
I couldn't help but be bothered by that scowl he had at that time.
I cautiously stepped into the shop, which was as dim and eerie as ever.
There were no customers.
Only Mad was sitting in the chair at the register.
However, something was wrong.
Unlike before, he wasn't leaning back in his chair.
He was just staring intently at what appeared to be a small, square chip in his hand.
His expression was still stern, but there was also a hint of loneliness about him.
"Um... Mad-san?"
When I spoke to him, Mad hurriedly hid the chip in his palm.
"O-oh, what do you want? Why did you come in here without permission?"
"It's not like I did it without permission, it's a shop so anyone can enter, right...?"
"Don't screw with me! You're a brazen brat for entering my shop without my permission!!"
I'm being told something very unreasonable.
"But, for Mad-san to not notice me coming in, you must have been really focused on that chip."
"I'm talking about the chip you're hiding in your palm."
"I'm not hiding anything!!"
"But I saw you. If you say you're not hiding it, then open your palm and show me what's--"
"Shut up, get out! And don't ever come back againnnnn!!"
As if pushed out by his words, I was kicked out of Mad-san's shop.
I came here to make Mad-san smile, but I'm doing the complete opposite.
Shiona was waiting for me in front of the shop.
Her smile warmed my heart a little.
"Huh? Why is Shiona here?"
"I was worried about where Rei was going, so I followed you."
"I came here to try and make Mad-san smile. But I just made him angry again..."
"Make Mad-san smile...? That's a very difficult thing to do. So don't worry about it. Mad-san getting angry is just normal."
"But, today he seemed angrier than usual."
"More than usual? Did something happen?"
"I don't really know, but I asked him about the chip."
"...Chip?"
"Yeah, it was a rectangular chip, small enough to fit in his palm. Mad-san was staring intently at it..."
I used my fingers to show Shiona the size of the chip Mad-san was holding.
Shiona's eyes widened slightly, as if she knew something about the chip.
"Could it be that you asked him about that chip?"
"Yeah. And then he suddenly got angry--"
"Yeah, yeah, I see. Rei, it can't be helped."
"Can't be helped? What do you mean?"
"That chip is Mad-san's treasure."
"Mad-san's treasure? What's inside it?"
"It should contain a movie that Mad-san's son made."
"His son's movie? Is Mad-san's son a movie director?"
"Yes, he is. But he left this town a long time ago and hasn't come back since."
Shiona said, looking towards the shop.
A strange expression, a mix of two emotions...troubled, but still with a smile.
"But why is he just staring at the chip? Why doesn't he just watch the movie?"
"That's impossible. There's no equipment in this town that can play that chip."
"So, Mad-san can't watch it even if he wants to, so he just stares at it like that?"
"I'm sure that's it. He's shy, so he won't say it out loud."
At that moment, I had an idea.
A way to make Mad-san, who always has a scowl and is always angry, smile.
“No, it’s nothing. Shiona, I have somewhere I want to stop by, so head back first.”
“Somewhere you want to stop by...?”
“Yeah, there's something I want to look into.”
“...The library?”
I thought I saw a surprised look on Shiona's face.
I wonder if she's worried about me, since I'm still not used to the town.
“I promise I won’t be late.”
I said clearly, trying to ease Shiona's worries.
Shiona opened her mouth as if to say something, but then closed it.
And once. She made a gesture as if to lightly bite her lip for a moment, and then smiled.
“...Okay. Be careful, Rei.”
I parted ways with Shiona in front of Mad-san's shop and started walking through the town alone.
The inside of the library was as dim as ever, and the air was stagnant.
I headed straight through the maze-like interior without hesitation.
Towards the blue girl who is always shedding tears--.
“Rei, you came.”
Tipi ran up to me as soon as she saw me.
I gently held her small body.
“Yeah, because I promised.”
“Thank you, Rei. I’m happy.”
Tipi has her face buried in my stomach.
I could feel her tears soaking through my clothes.
"Tipi, what were you doing?"
"Drawing. Come here, Rei."
Tipi took my hand, and I followed her.
There was drawing paper and crayons scattered where Tipi had been sitting.
There was a half-finished picture on the paper.
"Did you draw this, Tipi?"
"Yeah. I draw one every day."
Tipi said, and then resumed drawing.
I peered into the picture.
There was a picture of a singing girl and a boy turning a music box.
"Tipi, could this be...?"
"It's Rei and Shiona. Singing in the plaza."
So Tipi was watching us through the curtains after all.
The thought of Tipi watching us all alone made my chest ache for some reason.
"Rei, what's wrong? Are you hurt somewhere?"
The eyes of the girl looking up at me were full of sorrow.
I placed my hand on Tipi's head as if to comfort that emotion.
"I'm okay, it's nothing. It's a very good picture."
"Yeah... Thank you, I'm happy."
When I stroked her head, Tipi snuggled up to me affectionately.
But her face was fragile, and sad--
I truly wanted to see this child smile.
"You said you draw one every day, but are there other pictures?"
"Yeah, there are. Rei, come here."
Tipi stood up, took my hand, and led me deeper into the library.
There, the pictures were.
Tipi must have put them up herself; many pictures were pasted on the wall in a low position.
"This is the picture I drew yesterday, this is the day before that, this is the day before that..."
Tipi explained each one to me.
A picture of a girl holding hands with a young man, looking happy.
A young man and another girl visiting the girl.
And then, a picture of a girl crying alone.
Ah, I see.
This is Tipi's picture diary.
From then on, there were pictures of a girl continuing to cry alone.
Since I came here, Tipi hasn't been alone anymore.
The expression of the girl in the picture seemed a little softer.
Surely that is Tipi's emotion itself.
But it was still something that harbored sadness.
I wanted to make this girl smile too.
What can I do for that?
I can't think of an answer.
The only thing I can say is that I'll stay by Tipi's side like this.
"Hey Rei, what kind of book did you come to find today?"
Tipi, still with a sad look on her face, tugged at my sleeve and looked up at me.
"I'm looking for a device that can project images... Do you know of any books about that?"
"Yeah, I do. It's a little far from here, though."
"Will you guide me?"
"Yeah, okay. Here!"
And with that, Tipi spread out her arms.
The bear plushie in her right hand dangled in the air.
"Carry me."
I picked Tipi up.
Just like before, she rubbed her cheek against my chest.
"It's over there, Rei."
And so, I began to be guided to the book I was looking for.
The book was on the second floor of the library--
A corner of the shelf where materials on images from all ages and countries, such as projectors and projection devices, are gathered.
"The book you want to read is definitely here."
The books lined up on the shelf were all handwritten, just like the music box books and maps.
However, there seem to be quite a few types of projectors, some using film and some using discs.
"What kind are you looking for?"
"I'm looking for something that can project a chip about this size, do you know?"
I used my fingers to show the size of the chip that Mad had.
"Hmm... a square? Or a square with only one corner missing?"
"The corner was... like it was missing diagonally... I think."
I didn't look at it very closely, so I can't say for sure.
But Tipi nodded slightly.
"That shape, is it the chip that Mad has?"
"Yeah, it's the chip that Mad had."
I was surprised that Tipi knew about Mad, but he's the owner of the general store in this town, so there was nothing strange about it.
Shiona knew about Mad's chip too, and maybe everyone in town knows about it.
And the fact that Mad is stubborn and won't show the contents is probably common knowledge.
"Um, well... if that's the case... then... this."
Tiptoeing, Tipi points to a book on the shelf that she can barely reach.
"That's amazing, Tipi. You really do remember the location of all the books."
"Ehehe. I got praised."
Tipi presses her face against my stomach.
While patting her head, I pick up the book and check its contents.
It was more like an instruction manual than a book.
“Mume Company Projector” - It details the types of media and chips that can be played.
The internal structure and wiring are also carefully written down.
It seems to be a projection-type player that can project the contents recorded on a portable chip onto a screen or white wall.
If I can find this device, I can show Mad the movie inside the chip.
“Thank you, Tipi, I found the information I wanted.”
“...Are you leaving already?”
Tipi looks up at me with a sad expression.
“...Yeah, sorry.”
“Nooo. Don't go.”
Perhaps she intends to stop me from leaving.
Tipi hugs me.
Her innocent warmth shakes my resolve.
But, I have to go.
Because I want to make Mad happy right now.
Because I want to see Mad's smile.
“Tipi, I promise. I'll definitely come again tomorrow.”
“Tomorrow...? Really...?”
“Yeah, really. I promise.”
...You won't disappear?
Yeah, I won't disappear. I'll come to see you every day, without fail.
...Okay. I'll be waiting.
With lingering reluctance, I left the library, leaving behind the blue-haired girl - Tipi.
"You're back again! What did you come here for!!!"
As soon as I entered the shop, Mad's roar greeted me.
I want to run away.
I want to cover my ears.
But, I didn't.
Because I wanted to fulfill Mad's wish.
"Mad, I have a request. Please lend me your son's chip."
"That chip with your son's movie on it."
"Why should I lend it to you? Don't be ridiculous!!"
"Please... I'm begging you."
"Enough with your meddling! It's a nuisance!"
"I... I want to be helpful to you, Mad!!"
"Helpful, you say?"
Mad's gaze sharpens even further, and fear begins to take hold, constricting my throat.
The movable parts of my knees lose strength, and I feel lightheaded.
I want to run away right now... but I can't hesitate here.
"I heard about the chip from Shiona. That your son left town to become a movie director. And that movie was sent to you by your son, right? But you haven't been able to watch it because you don't have a device to play it, am I wrong?"
I spoke quickly, trying to suppress my fear.
Perhaps taken aback by my momentum, Mad looked at me with a slightly surprised expression.
"I just went to the library. To find out what kind of device is needed to play it."
"You... you went to the library...?"
Mad looked even more surprised at the word 'library'.
"Yes... I'll find a device that can play that chip. If the player is broken, I'll fix it. If I can't find one, I'll even try to build one by piecing together various parts."
"Why would you go so far? It's none of your business."
"It may be true that it's none of my business. But I want to do it."
"I want to be helpful to you, Mad... that's all. So, please."
Silence follows.
Is this a silence of affirmation, or--
"That guy was the worst, a complete idiot of a son."
Mad sat down in his chair and looked up at the ceiling.
And with a somewhat sad expression, he began to tell me his story.
All we ever did was fight.
Every time we met, a fight would start.
So, at some point, he started avoiding me.
No, maybe I was the one avoiding him.
Anyway, we stopped seeing each other as often.
So when he came to me and said he had something to talk about, I was surprised.
“I’m leaving this town.”
“Leaving town? What are you talking about?”
“I’m leaving this town to become a movie director. I realized, I really love movies.”
“Stop talking about dreams and face reality. Someone like you can’t be a director. There’s no way you can do it.”
“Don’t just assume it’s impossible! You won’t know unless you try!”
“I know, I’m your father. No one will watch a movie by a director without talent.”
“There are people who recognize me! I’ve been getting results! You’re just the only one who won’t acknowledge it!”
“I can’t even dream in a town like this!”
“A town like this? Say that again.”
“I’ll say it as many times as you want. I can’t stand a life where I spend my whole life in a shop like this in a town like this.”
“You… enough…”
“I’ll say it as many times as I want! You’re just afraid of things changing!”
“Ever since your mother died, you’ve been doing the same thing every day--”
Without thinking, I hit him.
“...That’s right, you always resort to violence. I’ve had enough.”
“...I see. Get out.”
“Yeah, I will. Keep doing the same thing here forever.”
My son left home.
And since then, he hasn’t even sent a single message.
All he ever sent was this movie on a chip.
How am I supposed to watch it when I don’t have a player?
I can’t forgive him for being so selfish.
I don’t want to watch a movie like this.
Even more than that, I don’t want to see his face.
I was surprised at how unusually talkative Mad-san was.
The more I heard his feelings, the more my own feelings grew.
If Mad-san really hated his son, he wouldn't keep a chip he couldn't play.
If his son hated Mad-san, he wouldn’t have sent him the movie he made.
Surely, he wants Mad-san to see this movie.
I think he sent that chip to Mad-san with some kind of feelings attached.
That’s why I want to show this movie to Mad-san.
I bowed my head again.
“Please! Let me borrow the chip!”
Mad-san came in front of me in silence.
I was prepared to be yelled at, but I wasn't scared anymore.
More than that, I had a stronger desire to do something useful for Mad-san.
But Mad-san handed me the chip he was holding.
“Do whatever you want.”
I stared again at the chip I received.
It was an object with a metal core covered in organic glass, running iridescent electronic circuits.
It was something within my knowledge. A general-purpose chip also used for Phylloid's memory backup.
It had become a global standard, and most manufacturers had adopted this format.
If that's the case, it might be playable even without a Mume Corporation projector.
I clenched the chip and lowered my head in the direction of Mad-san.
A deserted factory on the edge of town.
I had set foot in a mountain of garbage behind it.
I thought that if there was any device to play Mad-san's chip, it would be in this abandoned factory.
If there was one in town, he would have played it a long time ago.
Among the garbage, there are many pieces of equipment mixed in.
Those with broken wiring, those that have rusted.
As far as I can see, they are all unusable.
The possibility of finding the projector itself in this place is low. But I think I can find some parts, such as the board.
That's right, as I said to Mad-san, I'll connect the parts and assemble them so that the chip can be played.
This is the only place I can rely on.
If I don't do something here, Mad-san will remain with that expression forever.
I won't let that happen.
I don't want that to happen.
With only that in mind, I break down the scrap heap.
But no matter how much I search, I can't find the device I'm looking for.
I'm sure Mad-san must have searched for it before.
No... maybe Mad-san is still searching for it even now.
Shiona said that Mad-san fixes things he picks up at this garbage dump and sells them at the general store.
I wonder if his real purpose was to look for a projector to play his son's chip.
If that's the case, I wonder how Mad-san feels, having been unable to find it until now...
Instead of a projector, he picks up something else... I wonder what he was thinking when he was repairing it...
I broke Mad-san's clock.
Ah... I see... so that's why Mad-san was angry.
That clock was something in the process of Mad-san trying to get back something important to him.
This is speculation. But I think that's how it should be.
If that's the case, there's no way I can easily find what Mad-san has been searching for all along.
Even so, I won't give up.
Finding the projector should be the greatest atonement for Mad-san for me breaking the clock...
It was when I dragged a piece of equipment larger than my body.
I felt something strange in my right hand.
A very small discomfort... I feel a stiffness in the movement of the joints in my fingers.
Is it out of oil, or has something broken?
If I continue working like this, it might not be good.
I couldn't stop moving my hand.
Mad-san must have searched the area within my reach.
I look up at the mountain of scrap iron piled much higher than my height.
I might be able to climb it, since I weigh less than Mad-san.
Thinking that, I started to climb the unkempt, awkward stairs.
I could feel water hitting my back.
Large drops of rain were pouring down from the sky I looked up at.
"Rei, let's stop now."
A voice came from a position lower than my feet.
When I turned around, Shiona was there.
She was looking up at me, getting wet in the rain.
"It's raining. You'll catch a cold if you stay like this."
"I'm okay, I'll look a little more, thank you."
"Even if you don't find it, Mad-san will be happy because you tried so hard."
"I'm okay, Shiona. Just a little more."
I continued working.
From behind me, Shiona was talking to me unilaterally.
"But you're already soaking wet. Let's stop. You're tired, aren't you? No one will blame Rei for giving up."
Soothingly.
"I'm worried about your body, let's stop, okay? I'll be sad if you get hurt, Rei... Giving up is also important."
"There might be other ways, so let's go home today. I'm preparing orange fluffy soup."
"Let's go home... Rei, let's go home... Hey, Rei... I'm worried about you, Rei..."
Even so, I continued.
Undeterred by the pouring rain, I kept searching.
I pulled out a rusted iron plate.
At that moment, a small avalanche of scrap occurred.
I retreated, dodging the scrap that came piercing down with a roar.
"Look out, Rei!"
I turned around at Shiona's voice, and a mountain of scrap pouring down from behind jumped into my eyes.
The mountain piled up behind me was also avalanching in the same way.
While being swallowed up, I somehow ran up the collapsing scrap.
After a while, the avalanche subsided, and only the sound of rain remained around us again.
"Are you okay, Rei? Are you hurt?"
"Yeah, somehow... that was close."
"Really... I'm glad you're safe, so glad..."
Shiona let out a voice of relief.
As if to prove that I was safe, I stood up.
"Ah... Rei, that."
Shiona pointed at my feet with wide eyes.
The mountain of scrap that had collapsed earlier. Among it, there was a familiar piece of equipment.
It was the same equipment that was in the book Tipi had shown me.
I dug it out, and when I looked at the surface of the device, it was marked with the faded letters 'Mume'.
"I found it... Shiona, this is it! I found it!"
I lifted it up high so Shiona could see it.
The water that had accumulated inside flowed out as it tilted.
"I did it, Shiona! I finally found it! Now Mad will show us a movie!"
"Yeah, but... I think that machine is broken...?"
"Huh?"
Told by Shiona, I brought the hand holding the equipment in front of my eyes.
Certainly, the equipment I found--'Mume Corporation's projector'--had obvious signs of damage.
The lens part needed for projection was missing.
Also, there was a large crack in the upper part, and when I peeked inside, the internal board was full of rust.
With this, it is impossible to project a movie.
"That's too bad... Rei, shall we go home now?"
Shiona's hand was offered.
I placed my hand on top of that hand.
That warmth warmed my rain-chilled hand.
By the time we returned to town, the rain had stopped.
Even so, the inside of my heart did not clear up.
Can I really repair the projector that I'm holding in both hands?
In my mind, I was intending to fix it, but now that I've witnessed how tattered it is, that resolve wavers.
"What's wrong, being so soaking wet?"
I was unexpectedly called out to on the way back to the church.
When I turned around, the photography studio director who had taken our picture before was standing there.
"I was just looking for something."
"Looking for something...? I see. So, did you find what you were looking for?"
"Yes... but..."
"Is something the matter?"
"We found it, but it's broken and unusable," Shiona answered for me, who was feeling down.
"I see. That's too bad. By the way, what were you planning to use it for?"
"Actually... I wanted to play the chip that Mad has."
"Mad's? The chip that was sent by his son, right?"
"...Yes. I wanted to make Mad-san, who is always angry, happy..."
"Is that something you truly want to do from the bottom of your heart?"
The director asked gently, yet as if testing me.
"Yes, of course."
I answered without hesitation.
"Mad-san... always has an angry face and looks very pained. I think if there's a chance, he'll smile. I think people can be happy if they can laugh. And I think other people who see that can be happy too."
Having said that much, I look at Shiona.
"I... learned that from Shiona."
Shiona looked surprised at my words, but soon smiled.
 
Yeah, that's the expression. Someone's smile makes the people around them feel happy too.
The moment Shiona smiled at me, my heart also warmed.
I see... mind if I take a look at that?
The director pointed at the projector I was holding. I silently handed over the broken device.
The photography studio director carefully examined the device.
I see, this is terrible. There are too many missing parts to even try to fix it.
Hearing that from the director, who usually maintains his cameras, makes me feel discouraged.
Perhaps noticing my depressed mood, the director returned the projector with a wry smile.
Let's go home soon, Rei? You'll catch a cold.
That's right. Staying wet in the rain will be bad for you. You should go home and change first.
Any more and we'll just be bothering the director-san.
Even if I'm okay, the human Shiona will catch a cold.
Hugging the projector, I bowed to the director and we headed towards the church.
When we returned to the church, Shiona wiped my head with a fluffy towel.
Gently, softly, dabbing carefully so as not to rub.
That's too bad about the projector.
…Yeah, but that place was originally a garbage dump, so it's only natural that it's broken.
I should have realized that if I thought about it. But I was hoping for a convenient outcome.
That if I wished for it, something would happen. That if I worked hard, results would surely follow.
I'm made to realize that reality isn't that sweet.
It can't be helped. You did your best, Rei, no one will complain.
But... but I wanted to show Mad the movie.
Yeah... you're kind, Rei.
It's not kindness or anything like that. I just think it's my role.
But just that feeling alone will make Mad happy. That's enough.
I hope so...
For now, let's warm up, okay? I'll get you something to drink that'll warm your body and soul.
Folding the towel she used to wipe my head, Shiona smiled and headed towards the kitchen.
I sat down on a chair and sighed.
I look at the broken projector on the table.
...No, there's no point in being depressed.
Even though it's broken, if you think about it from where we started, we've made some progress.
If I fix this projector little by little, someday it should be able to play chips.
The book I borrowed from Tipi had instructions on how to disassemble it for maintenance.
If I unravel it in order, I should be able to fix it.
I can look for the missing parts one by one at that factory.
I want to see Mad smile. I want to see a look of joy like Shiona had when the music box was fixed.
I renew my determination to fix the projector.
Just then, I notice that the church's main hall is getting noisy.
Excuse me.
Opening the door and peeking out, I saw the photography studio manager.
And behind him, even more townspeople.
What's going on?
I asked, puzzled, and the townspeople offered me something with smiles on their faces.
This is a part from our broken clock. Use it if you like.
I thought this wiring might fit.
Use my light!
No, use mine!
We have plenty of tools at our place, so use as many as you need.
Various electrical components, wiring equipment, electronic circuits, gears, and screws were placed on the table one after another.
Unable to understand the scene, I was stunned, and the manager smiled kindly.
...Um, what is this?
You're going to fix that projector, right? When I told everyone about it, they brought things that might be useful. Some of it might be unnecessary, but it's better to have materials than not, right?
But why...?
Everyone was moved by your and Shiona's music and singing. They really wanted to thank you. ...I'm one of them too.
The manager took out a lens and handed it to me.
This... It's a camera lens. I wonder if it will fit?
I felt something warm deep inside my chest.
And that warmth gradually welled up.
Eventually, that warmth reached the depths of my eyes, becoming hotter and hotter.
Words wouldn't form properly in my head. I wanted to say something, but only my lips trembled.
Shiona, holding a steaming cup, was gently watching me like that.
Shiona... my chest feels warm. I wonder why.
Rei, that's an emotion called 'joy'.
As she said that, she approached me and handed me a cup filled with a drink that had a heart-warming aroma.
Everyone is responding to Rei's desire to make Mad happy. Everyone wants to make Mad happy, with Rei at the center.
I wonder if I'm not being a nuisance... even though I started this on my own.
If they thought you were a nuisance, everyone wouldn't have such warm smiles.
I looked at the townspeople who had brought the parts, one by one.
They each held their parts in their hands, held them up so I could see them, and smiled at me.
...Everyone... thank you very much.
Using the parts and tools I received, I started the repairs on the spot.
I proceeded with the help of various people in areas I didn't understand on my own.
I removed the moisture, carefully scraped off the rusted parts with a file, and repaired the broken electronic circuits with copper foil.
I corrected the solder that was about to come off using the tip of a screwdriver heated until it turned red.
No, no, it's not like that, it's like this.
No, no, it should be like this!
You're both wrong! It's definitely like this here!
No, it's not like this, it's like that.
Noisily, but cheerfully, the repair was done by everyone.
And then, finally...
The repair was finished in a patchwork, clumsy state.
Thank you, everyone.
It's nothing. In return, let us hear that song again.
The children love it. Please do it again.
Listening to it with him puts me in a good mood.
When I listen to that song... it reminds me of the old days...
I love that song, it's so much fun!
A clumsy device made by everyone.
It looked nothing like the ones I saw in books.
But it was a one-of-a-kind projector made by everyone.
I felt more joy than I ever had before.
Everyone there was genuinely happy about its completion.
All that's left is to test it out.
Hearing the words 'test run,' I looked around the room.
Come to think of it, I've never seen electricity in this town.
The photographer also used an analog camera.
Um... could it be that this town doesn't have electricity...?
At my question, everyone in the room suddenly looked startled.
It was an awkwardness, like I had touched on something I shouldn't have.
Even the director who suggested the test run had fallen silent.
It's the library.
It was Shiona who spoke, as if to break the awkward silence.
This town doesn't have electricity, but the power storage facility is still around.
That's the library?
Yes, it is.
It was as if a ray of hope had shone through.
I felt my cheeks soften.
But Shiona's expression... even though she was smiling, her eyes looked sad.
The next day, I went to the library with Shiona.
Carrying the handmade projector that I made with the townspeople yesterday.
I didn't know there was a device like this here.
The library counter was equipped with a device that used sunlight to store electricity in portable batteries.
Apparently, it's the only device left in this town.
However, due to the aging of the solar panels, it's not capable of generating a large amount of electricity.
For this town, electrical energy is a precious commodity.
Despite my selfishness, everyone in town allowed me to use such a valuable thing.
On the condition that I play music for them again, they always said.
However, there was something that I couldn't help but wonder about.
I had a feeling that the library held some special meaning for the people of this town.
Everyone's reaction yesterday... Thinking back, even Mad-san's expression changed when I went to the library.
...No, I shouldn't make strange assumptions now.
I looked away from the charging battery and looked at Shiona, trying to hide the anxiety in my heart.
I need to have Shiona sing again.
Yeah, I'll sing with gratitude to everyone.
Shiona gives me her usual smile.
Next to Shiona was Tipi.
She was looking at Shiona with a slightly bewildered expression.
Come to think of it, this is the first time I've seen these two together.
Tipi, how long do you think it will take to charge?
Um... probably about thirty minutes more, I think.
I see, that's surprisingly fast.
I can only be with Rei for another thirty minutes...?
Tipi takes a wide detour around Shiona and hugs my leg.
Her sad expression hasn't changed.
But I felt that her sadness had eased just a little.
I stroke Tipi's head with the palm of my hand.
As I stroked her silky hair over and over, Tipi rubbed her cheek against my leg.
...Okay, you two. That's enough.
Shiona wedges herself between me and Tipi.
Ah... Rei, Rei...
Tipi reaches out for me.
But her hand doesn't reach me.
Rei, a little...
Shiona grabs my arm and drags me to the wall.
--Shiona's sweet scent tickled my nose.
Rei, Tipi-chan is a girl now. Do you understand what that means?
I know. She's cute and affectionate, isn't she?
That's not what I mean... I don't think it's good to touch her so casually or get too friendly with her.
Why? I think it's fine if Tipi is happy.
That's not it... I don't think it's good to touch girls of that age so casually.
Even if you say 'of that age,' Tipi is still a child, right?
Girls mature on the inside faster than they look. She already has a pink heart.
Pink...? What does that mean?
Pink is pink. That's why I don't think it's good.
Shiona seemed more upset than usual.
She's talking to me with a smile, but her cheeks are slightly puffed out.
Come to think of it, her smile always stiffened when I said I was going to the library.
It seems Shiona doesn't like me getting along with Tipi very much.
Even now, it looks like she's competing with Tipi.
...Hey, Shiona. Could it be that this feeling is 'jealousy'?
At my words, Shiona's eyes widened and she gasped.
She restlessly moved her gaze, avoiding looking at me.
It's an expression she, who always has a smile, is showing for the first time.
I reach out my hand to Shiona's head.
Eh? Rei...?
And then, I gently stroked her hair, just like I do with Tipi.
W-wa, Rei, what's with you all of a sudden? What's wrong?
Unlike Tipi's, Shiona's hair was smooth and felt good. A nice scent wafts up every time I stroke it.
It's the kind of hair that makes you want to touch it forever.
R-Rei? I feel kind of embarrassed, okay? Right?
Ah, sorry. But, I somehow felt like this was the right thing to do.
I don't really understand why, but looking at Shiona now makes my chest feel warm.
A feeling similar to the joy I learned about before is welling up.
S-so, anyway, let's refrain from sticking together too much, okay? Okay? Will you promise me?
Yeah, if that's what Shiona says, then I will.
So, I had no choice but to say that.
We return to Tipi's side.
Tipi looked up at us anxiously.
What's wrong? Is Tipi a bad girl? Is that why you're both angry?
Tipi furrows her brow sadly.
It's okay. It's nothing.
Really? You're really, really not angry? Because Shiona's face... is red?
T-this is, it's different, okay? I'm not red and prickly, okay?
Hmm... okay, I understand.
Tipi shed tears as if relieved.
Actually, I want to wipe away those tears with my fingertips, but Shiona would surely hate that.
So I decided to suppress that impulse.
I turn on the projector that has finished charging.
A low motor sound rings out, and the exhaust fan starts to spin.
The light at the top that indicates it's preparing to start was flashing.
It's been a while since I've seen an electric light. Me, Shiona, and Tipi were all staring at the blinking light with eyes as if we were seeing something rare.
Um... where's the place to insert the chip...?
The lid on the side of the projector is broken and the control panel is exposed.
In the center of it, there is a place to insert the chip.
I slowly inserted the chip I received from Mad.
The projector frantically flashed a red reading lamp, trying to check the data inside.
We watched the situation with bated breath.
After about 10 seconds, the intervals between the lamp flashes shortened--and changed to a green light.
This... means it's okay, right?
Anxiety and excitement mixed, and my voice was strained.
Yeah, it means the projector is fixed and the data inside is okay.
Shiona's words made my heart soar. I could feel the corners of my mouth naturally turning up.
I felt a sense of "joy" at the satisfaction of accomplishing something new.
After charging the projector and confirming its operation, we were heading to Mad-san's store.
Tipi said she was sleepy and stayed behind in the library.
I wanted her to see it with us, but Shiona warned me not to push her too hard.
I wonder if Mad-san will be happy.
Y-yeah... I'm sure he'll be happy.
I hope so. It's something everyone in town made together. All the more so because it contains everyone's feelings.
Y-yeah... that's right.
What's wrong, Shiona? Is something the matter?
Shiona has been somewhat distant since a while ago.
No, it's nothing.
Is that so... I feel like something's different...
More than that, Rei, it's cloudier than usual today, and my heart is turning gray.
Shiona muttered as she looked up at the sky.
I looked up at the sky in the same way, but I couldn't see any difference from usual.
Rather, since it rained, the dust in the atmosphere has been washed away, making it somewhat easier to breathe.
And it's humid, making me feel all bumpy. So, Rei, why don't we relax at home today? Let's get fluffy with orange soup.
Does Shiona find this air unpleasant...?
No, I think Shiona's words are hiding what she really wants to say.
But I didn't really understand what that meant.
I can't imagine Shiona being mean.
But we went to the trouble of making it together. I want Mad-san to see his son's movie soon.
I see... you're right.
Shiona fell silent after that.
She's not angry.
She's keeping pace with me, walking beside me.
But there was a shadow in her expression.
We arrived at Mad-san's store and stepped inside the dimly lit interior.
Hey... what are you doing barging in here?
Mad-san's booming voice echoed from the back of the store.
He was sitting back in his chair, staring straight at us.
Hello, Mad-san. Um... this.
I took out the patchwork projector.
Mad-san glared at it as if he were appraising it.
What is that? We don't buy garbage here.
That's not it. It looks bad, but it's a projector that can play your son's movie.
My son's movie? I don't remember asking anyone to make something like that.
I wasn't asked, that's true. I did it on my own. But many people in town helped me make this. I want Mad-san to watch the movie with everyone.
I'm telling you, I don't remember asking for any of this.
I understand. I did it on my own. So what I'm about to do is also something I'm doing on my own. Stop me if you want to.
I tried to step forward.
But from behind, Shiona pulled on my sleeve, stopping me.
Rei, Mad-san's being prickly and purple... you should stop for today. Let's try another day, okay?
Shiona, we've come this far. Mad-san may say that, but he must want to see his son's movie. If we don't watch it here, we probably never will.
Besides, if he really hated it, I'd be thrown outside by now.
It's just a guess based on Mad-san's past behavior, but I don't think I'm wrong.
It's okay, Shiona. So don't look so worried. It's going to be alright.
I nodded firmly, trying to dispel Shiona's anxiety.
…Okay, Rei. If that's what you want, do as you please.
Shiona let go of my sleeve.
I start walking again.
I placed the equipment on the register counter and closed the store door.
Next, I closed all the window curtains.
The already dark store became even darker.
It's just the right darkness for playing a movie.
Then, I turned on the projector, which I had just charged. The fan whirred to life, and after a moment, the attached light turned on.
A square of light appeared on the store wall.
I adjusted the lens I received from the photo studio manager and focused it.
Mad-san simply stared at the action.
Mad-san, I'm going to play the movie now. Is that alright?
…Do as you damn well please.
Mad-san didn't deny it.
I'm certain that's the answer Mad-san wanted to give.
I placed my finger on the button on the control panel…
──Play.
Mad-san stared at the square of light with a stern expression.
Within the light, a story begins.
It was the story of a single boy.
It was set in an era when the sky was still blue and nature remained.
Born in a small house in a small town, he never knew his mother.
The father he lived with only provided the bare minimum…it was hardly a relationship you could call family.
And as the boy grew up, the gap between them deepened.
They would fight whenever they saw each other's faces.
Every short conversation was a denial of each other.
Before long, their gazes no longer met.
The boy returned home less and less, eventually stepping onto a path of evil.
His father silently struck him for it.
His brow furrowed more deeply than usual...
The boy runs straight out of the house and leaves town.
But that was the beginning of harsh days.
He was conveniently used and betrayed by those he thought were his friends, leaving him battered in body and soul.
It was a woman who supported him through all of that.
His meeting with her would lead him down the right path.
The boy washed his hands of evil and decided to move to a new town and start his life over.
──He had a family.
A son was born, and he believed without a doubt that he would continue to live happily with his beloved wife.
But...the woman passed away from illness.
There was no time to despair.
He worked desperately to raise the child she left behind.
However, he was so desperate to work that he didn't notice the growing rift in his relationship with his child.
Every time they opened their mouths, they would only fight.
Days of drifting apart continued.
And the grown-up child stepped onto a path of evil, as if to spite him...
He thought it was a punishment.
Isn't this exactly what I did to my father?
Now, he curses his immature past.
He thought about how to stop his son and stared at his hands.
If he opened his hand, he could gently persuade his son with the kindness of a head pat and an embrace.
If he clenched his fist, it would become a fist, and he could admonish his son with severity.
As a father, which should he choose?
──He clenched his fist.
The fist that struck his son was hot, his chest ached as if it were being squeezed...deep lines etched into his brow.
But his son, holding his red and swollen cheek, shed tears.
He had been properly scolded, and he was loved...or so he thought.
Hearing those words, he too shed tears.
Why couldn't he have realized back then what his son had realized now?
That the face of his father after hitting him wasn't one of anger, but of sorrow.
He took his son and returned to the town where he was born for the first time in 20 years.
The townscape was almost unchanged since he ran away.
And the small family home that hadn't changed either.
But his father, who lived alone in that house, looked a size smaller than he remembered, perhaps due to old age.
He stood before his father, biting his lip and shedding tears.
His father silently patted him lightly on the shoulder and muttered only one word.
Mr. Mad's son's movie was a very old type of human drama.
I don't know if this is interesting.
If my emotional functions were normal, I might be able to judge.
But Mr. Mad was engrossed in the screen.
He watched the movie in silence from beginning to end.
The end credits finished rolling, and the screen went completely black.
It seems to be over.
Siona glanced at me once before reaching for the projector's stop button.
The moment her slender fingertip was about to touch the button, I grasped Siona's hand.
"...? Rei?"
Siona looked at me with a puzzled expression. But I was staring at the screen.
Because in the center of the pitch-black screen, letters slowly began to appear.
The letters, probably handwritten, were filled with a clear "emotion."
"This film is dedicated to my father."
The letters slowly melted into the darkening screen and disappeared.
This time, the movie quietly came to an end.
Silence fell around us.
Even after I turned off the power, Mr. Mad was still staring intently at where the screen had been.
"Mr. Mad... the movie's over, you know?"
A sigh was his response to my words.
"...A boring movie."
He muttered in a small voice, unlike anything I would have expected from Mr. Mad.
"It was so boring, I got tired of holding back my yawns."
He wiped away the tears that had accumulated from holding back his yawns as if discarding them, then stood up from his chair and removed the chip from the projector.
Then he clutched it tightly in his palm and sat back down in his chair.
"...Just get lost already."
He said in a voice with little inflection, then closed his eyes as if pondering something.
Could it be that the son's feelings didn't reach him through this movie?
Was it just a movie that didn't matter to Mr. Mad...?
If so, what I did was──
My chest tightened, and I hurriedly called out to Mr. Mad, feeling like I had to say something.
But Siona lightly tugged on my clothes, interrupting me.
"Rei, it's okay."
Siona smiled, lowering the corners of her eyebrows.
"Mr. Mad is just not being honest with himself. Let's leave him alone for now, okay?"
Not being honest...?
In other words, everything Mr. Mad said just now meant the opposite?
"Mr. Mad, you're very smooth right now. You're filled with a beautiful light blue. It's thanks to Rei."
"Really... If that's the case..."
I feel a warmth deep in my chest.
I know this feeling.
It's the emotion called 'joy'.
I'm happy that I was able to please Mr. Mad.
I couldn't be happier that I was able to help.
We quietly left the store so as not to disturb Mr. Mad.
Leaving the projector behind so he can watch movies again, whenever he likes.
When we got outside the store, we could faintly see an orange glow on the other side of the sky.
It was a color that seemed to reflect my feelings.
"I'm really glad Mr. Mad was happy."
"Yes, me too."
But her smile was somewhat sad.
"Huh? What is it?"
"You seem sad to me."
"Really? I'm not. Mr. Mad was happy, so my heart is full."
"Really? If you say so."
"Hey, Rei. Shall we have a feast today?"
"A feast? Why?"
"Because it's the anniversary of Rei making Mr. Mad happy."
"Anniversary... Yeah, it's an anniversary."
"Let's make orange soup and have a fluffy day today, okay?"
"Yeah, let's do that. I'll help with the cooking too."
"Thank you. I'm so happy, Rei."
Siona's hand touches mine.
Without a word, we held hands.
A warmth is born in our joined hands.
The orange sky was eventually swallowed by the encroaching darkness of night.
The next day, we decided to sing in the plaza as promised with everyone who helped us repair the projector.
Since we went to all this trouble, we wanted Mr. Mad to listen with us, so we visited his store.
But the door remained closed.
Even though it's usually open by now, a sign reading 'CLOSED' is hanging there.
The store door is locked, and we can't get inside.
I peek into the store through the gap in the door.
The projector is left on the counter.
Nothing has changed since yesterday.
The chair Mr. Mad was sitting in is obscured by the shelf, so I can't see it.
"I wonder what's wrong, Mr. Mad. Maybe he's not feeling well."
"...I knew it would end up like this."
"End up like this...? What do you mean?"
I tilt my head at Siona, who speaks as if she knew the store would be closed.
"From the middle of yesterday's movie, Mr. Mad's redness and prickliness disappeared."
"Redness... and prickliness?"
"Yeah, I don't think he needs to endure it anymore. It was the first time I'd ever seen Mr. Mad so calm."
Siona smiles in a troubled way.
"Mr. Mad, was he enduring something all this time?"
"That's right. He really wanted to reconcile with his son all along. He wanted to fly to his son's side. But Mr. Mad is always red and prickly, right? So he never had a chance."
"So, could it be that yesterday's movie...?"
"That's right. Because Rei showed Mr. Mad his son's movie, Mr. Mad was able to be honest with himself."
"...Could it be, Mr. Mad went to see his son?"
"Yes. I think he left town."
Siona smiles gently. Seeing that smile, I realize that I was really able to help Mr. Mad.
My chest suddenly warms up, and it turns into words that come out of my mouth.
"That's amazing! That's amazing, Siona! It's just like that movie! It wasn't a son going to see his father, but it's almost exactly like the movie!"
"Yes, it is. It's really amazing. But there's just one thing that's troubling me."
"Something troubling?"
Siona's expression clouds over, and she sighs softly.
Mr. Mad and his son are reconciling, so what could be troubling her?
"I don't think Mr. Mad will be back for a while, so I won't be able to get the ingredients for the orange, fluffy soup."
Siona said with a serious face.
"That's...troubling, isn't it?"
"Yeah, it's troubling, right? But if I save the ingredients I have now, I should be okay for a while."
Siona relaxes her tight lips and smiles.
Looking at her, I naturally feel my cheeks moving.
From deep inside my chest, something warm wells up.
I don't know what to call this feeling, but I feel very fulfilled.
I hope Mr. Mad comes back soon. I'd really like to hear his story. Maybe his son will come with him, too. That would be even better.
"Yes, I agree. I hope that happens."
Little by little, I'm able to learn about emotions. I was really feeling that.
I'm getting closer to the image of who I want to be.
I want to help people more and more.
I want to learn more and more emotions.
That feeling was becoming my biggest driving force.
"Let's get going soon, Rei. It's getting late."
"That's right. Let's hurry. I wonder how many people we can make smile today."
"I'm sure it will be a lot. Even more than yesterday."
"That's because Siona's singing voice is beautiful."
"No, it's because of Rei's playing."
"Even if it's playing, all I'm doing is turning the handle."
"That's what's important. When the person turning it has a kind heart, the music becomes warm and spreads out in a fluffy way."
Siona smiles as she gently spreads her hands.
"If it were just my singing, I'm sure no one would stop. My singing is only what it is because of Rei's playing. Thank you, Rei."
My face flushes.
"I wonder why, Siona. My face is really hot."
"Really. Your face is bright red. You must be embarrassed."
"Embarrassed? Is this the emotion of embarrassment?"
"Yeah, Rei, you're surprisingly shy. It's cute."
Hearing Siona's words, my face grew even hotter.
After leaving Mr. Mad's shop, we visited the plaza.
Many people had already gathered there before we even arrived.
"We've been waiting for you two! We're counting on you again today!"
"My child has been saying 'Let's go listen to the songs!' since yesterday. Please do your best."
"Your songs are healing. Thank you so much."
"Big brother, big sister, sing again!"
Everyone we met was waiting for our melody.
And everyone was wearing a smile.
This was it.
This is what I had been searching for.
To do something, to be liked and appreciated by people.
This is what I wanted.
What a great feeling.
What warmth deep in my heart.
I wanted to experience this feeling forever.
"Siona, let's begin. Let's make everyone smile."
"Yeah, of course."
I turned the music box handle just like yesterday.
The melody overflows.
Siona weaves a melody to match the sound.
And that melody spreads a large circle of smiles.
Smiles spread throughout the town.
More than anything, that made me happy.
And Siona's profile as she sang so happily was my joy.
The townspeople listened with smiles, just like yesterday.
The circle of smiles widens.
Suddenly—I felt a slight discomfort in the hand turning the music box handle.
My right hand, gloved to hide my mechanical hand.
I feel a slight creak in that hand turning the handle.
"Hey, how was that machine from the day before yesterday?"
I was spoken to while cleaning up after the performance, and I raised my head.
There was the director and the townspeople who provided the parts.
"It played, and Mr. Mad was happy. It's all thanks to you."
"I see, that's good. It was worth calling out to everyone."
"It's really thanks to all of you, thank you very much."
"No, it's nothing... but you know, it's all thanks to your power that it turned out this way."
"Oh yes. Because of your actions, people came forward to cooperate like this."
"But that's because everyone is kind. My actions are just a trigger."
"Of course, that's part of it. But you won't know or change anything unless you act. It's not about who's the greatest or who's amazing. It's about the value of the person who acted first."
The director and all the people who cooperated had warm smiles on their faces.
"If there's anything else, don't hesitate to ask. We'll cooperate as much as we can."
The director and the others said that and scattered away.
Watching them leave, I thought.
"Hey, Siona."
"What's wrong, Rei?"
"I really want to make more people happy."
"Making people happy is a wonderful thing."
"Yes, it is. But being able to feel that way is wonderful, Rei."
I was a little happy to be praised by Siona.
I can feel the warmth slowly spreading deep in my chest.
"So, I want to help and be useful to many people. I want to meet more and more people and help them solve their problems and troubles."
"If that's what you want to do, Rei, I think it's a good idea."
"Then Siona, let's go look! Let's go help the people in this town who are in trouble!"
"...wait."
"You see, Rei, I think that's a little different."
I was sure that Siona would agree with me.
But she shook her head with a troubled look.
"Certainly, helping people is a wonderful thing. But, I think it's wrong to force it on them."
"Force it...? I don't intend to do anything like that?"
"Of course, I understand how you feel, Rei. But, people have walls and problems that they have to overcome themselves. If you help them with everything, they won't be able to grow. Of course, helping them is important, but first, that person has to really try their best, and only when they can't overcome it on their own do they need help. So, Rei, let's help someone when they ask for help. It's not too late to help them then."
I understood what Siona was saying.
I was able to understand it.
But deep down, I felt something was bothering me.
Why should I leave my desire to help people as it is?
Why shouldn't I help people on my own?
Why, why, why...
At that point, I stopped thinking.
Because Siona's smile seemed somehow sad.
A few days later.
The discomfort resurfaced.
It was the discomfort in my right hand that I had felt when I was playing the music box.
A sensation so small that I couldn't put it into words.
But it was definitely attacking my right hand.
The discomfort was gradually increasing.
After returning to Siona's house, I tried moving my fingertips one by one in my room.
Then, every finger, when bent to a certain depth, could not bend any further.
I can't grab anything with this.
This is a problem that will interfere with my daily life.
No matter how many times I try, the problem doesn't go away.
Maybe it needs a fundamental repair, like taking it apart once.
I have an idea what's causing this malfunction.
It was when I was looking for that projector.
I really pushed myself too hard in that junkyard.
I felt a strange sensation when I was moving heavy things.
I'll go to that abandoned factory later today.
And I'll go look for tools for the repair.
"Rei, it's time for dinner."
Siona suddenly comes into the room.
I hurriedly put on my gloves and hid my exposed right hand.
"What's wrong? Why are you in such a hurry?"
"It's nothing. I was just spacing out, so you startled me."
"Did I surprise you? I'm sorry about that. I'll knock next time."
"Yeah, thanks. I'd appreciate it if you did."
"Okay, I understand. So, dinner's ready, are you going to eat now?"
I look at the clock.
Before I knew it, the hands of the clock had passed the top.
"It's already this late..."
"It's always so cloudy outside. You lose track of time, don't you?"
"Yeah, I'll be there soon. Will you wait for me?"
"Okay, I understand. I'll be waiting in the kitchen, Rei."
Siona smiled sweetly and left the room.
I took off my gloves again and checked my right hand.
...Somehow, I have to keep Siona from finding out.
Even if I go to the abandoned factory, it will be after I eat.
I steeled myself and headed to the kitchen.
In the kitchen, Siona's homemade dishes were lined up.
"Rei, have a seat. Let's eat."
Siona put her hands together in front of her face.
I put my hands together in the same way.
"Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil."
These words that Siona taught me.
Before I knew it, I had come to offer the same prayer.
I've spent that much time with Siona.
Thinking about it, my heart naturally warmed.
"Huh? It's nothing."
"Really? You have a happy look on your face? It's all orange and fluffy."
"A happy look? Me...?"
"Yes, very, very much so. Rei, you've been making that face a lot lately. It makes me happy too."
"Does that mean... I'm 'smiling'?"
"Yes, that's right. You didn't smile at all at first, but lately you've been smiling a lot. I'm happy."
"I'm... smiling...?"
I remember the first day I woke up.
That day, the face I saw was expressionless.
From that day on, I kept wishing.
I wanted emotions.
It seems that before I knew it, I had begun to obtain what I desired.
I felt a lightness in my heart, glad that it was so.
Now I can be with Siona and the others forever.
I looked down at my right hand.
With this hand, hanging limply and powerless, I can't even use a spoon properly.
Reluctantly, I switched to my left hand and scooped up the soup.
Eating with my unfamiliar left hand proved extremely difficult.
"What's wrong, Rei...? Oh, Rei, are you left-handed?"
"No... I'm right-handed, but my right hand hurts today."
"It hurts? That's terrible! I have to call a doctor... Ah, but there aren't any in this town, so I'll have to call one from a town far away..."
"No, it's okay. It'll heal if I leave it alone."
This is bad... this is bad.
If a doctor sees me, my true identity will be revealed.
That's the one thing I have to avoid.
I want to stay here forever.
"It must be because you overdid it the other day. Working so hard in the rain..."
"...Yeah, I think that's probably it."
"See, you didn't stop when I told you to. I'm worried about your body, Rei."
"Yeah, thanks. But thanks to that hard work, Mad-san was happy, so it was worth it."
"Yes, that's true. But don't push yourself too hard."
Siona looks at me with a worried expression.
I won't do anything that makes her look like that again.
Seeing Siona with any expression other than a smile makes my heart turn blue.
"Speaking of which, I wonder if Mad-san has returned. Has there been any contact since then?"
"Not yet. His son lives a little far away. I'm sure he hasn't arrived yet."
"I see. I hope he gets in touch soon."
"Yeah, me too."
After that, Siona didn't ask me about my right hand.
I finished my meal early with my unfamiliar left hand.
Then I returned to my room and began to prepare.
I packed my tools into my bag.
I'll probably end up disassembling my own arm.
I need to solve this on my own.
I can't rely on anyone.
That's why I made thorough preparations.
As I was concentrating on preparing, I heard a knock on the door.
Immediately after, Siona came into the room.
"Rei, if you're free, want to go shopping...? Are you going somewhere?"
Siona asked, looking back and forth between the bag and me.
"Yeah. I'm just looking for something."
"Where are you going? Is it close? Far? When will you be back?"
"I'm going to the abandoned factory. I'm planning to come back as soon as possible."
"Abandoned factory? What are you going there for?"
"Well... actually, the photo studio director asked me for some parts, and I'm going to look for them."
It was a lie.
It was a clumsy lie, but Siona smiled at me.
"I see... I understand. Please be really careful, okay? Your right hand isn't in good shape as it is, right?"
"Yeah, thanks. I'll try to get back as soon as possible."
I was seen off by Siona and left the church.
My destination was the abandoned factory--.
But there was a place I had to stop by before that.
I need to cover up the lie I blurted out.
If, by any chance, Siona meets the director and talks about me, my lie will be exposed.
If that happens, I'll end up hurting Siona.
I don't want to hurt Siona.
That's why my feet were visiting the photo studio.
Oh, a rare customer.
When I opened the door, the director, who was polishing a camera, greeted me.
I'm sorry for intruding so suddenly.
No, it's fine... I was just about to head home.
Home... to the church? Did you have some business there?
Ah, just wait a moment.
The director retreated into the back.
While waiting, I decided to look around at the displayed photos.
There were various photos displayed, from old ones to recent ones.
The years they were taken, the places, and the people were all different.
But there was one thing they all had in common.
That was that everyone was smiling in the same way.
I couldn't help but envy the people in those smiling photos.
Well now, sorry to keep you waiting. Here, this is it.
The director held out a photo to me.
In it were a smiling Siona and aExpressionless me.
It's a photo I took before. It took a while to develop. I apologize for the delay.
That's not true. Thank you. But, I don't have any money...
It's fine. It was delayed, and I took it because I wanted to. I'll make it a service.
Thank you very much. I'll give it to Siona.
Please do. Still, looking at it like this, you and Siona's brother really do look alike.
You know Siona's brother?
Ah, of course. Have you ever seen a picture of Siona and her brother together?
Yes, I have. The one where they're holding a music box, right?
Ah, that's the one. Actually, I took that photo.
Is that so...? When did her brother leave on his journey?
It was probably right after I took that photo. He said he was going to spread music all over the world. Siona was so sad. She's always smiling like that, but she was crying the whole time then.
Siona was? I can't believe it...
...But, lately she's been smiling a lot. As much as when her brother was around... No, maybe even more.
Is that so? Now that you mention it, I think she's always smiling.
I'm sure it's because you're here.
I think it's partly because you resemble her brother, but I don't think that's all there is to it.
But I haven't been able to do anything for Siona.
Making someone smile isn't just about doing something for them. You can also make them smile just by being near them, by being by their side.
Being by her side... Then I'm confident that I can be by Siona's side more than anyone else.
I can see that too. When Siona is with you, she seems to be showing a smile from the bottom of her heart.
Those words warmed my heart.
I'm connected to Siona's smile.
Because I'm here, Siona is--
It's strange for me to ask, but will you stay close to Siona forever?
Of course. I'll always, always be by Siona's side, and keep her smiling. That's my greatest wish.
Hahaha, it's like a proposal. It's a shame Siona isn't here to see it.
A pro...posal...?
Hearing those words, I felt my face getting hot.
I know the meaning of the word.
It's a promise between a human man and woman to spend their lives together.
Was what I just said the same as that?
Thinking about it that way, my face gets even hotter.
I turn my back to the shop owner so he won't notice my agitation.
Um, well, I have somewhere to be, so...
Is that so? Be sure not to lose that photo.
Yes, thank you very much.
I said my thanks over my shoulder and left the photo shop.
The road to the abandoned factory.
I push forward through the reddish-black earth.
The bag filled with tools is a heavy burden.
I could hear the tools rubbing against each other in the bag hanging from my shoulder.
The wind is strong, and it looks like it's about to rain.
It would be self-defeating if I went to fix it and ended up making more things break.
I decided to hurry to the abandoned factory before it rained.
On the way.
In the distance, I spotted something white flickering.
But the place was too far away, and there was no way to confirm what the object was.
I still couldn't tell how big it was, but the white object seemed to be slowly approaching me.
I tried to focus my eyes and confirm it.
At that moment, a gust of wind blew.
I couldn't help but close my eyes.
When I opened my eyes again, the white object had disappeared from sight.
What in the world was that just now...?
For a while, I stood there, frozen.
But I can't stay like this.
The weather is getting worse and worse.
I have to get to the abandoned factory quickly.
Just as the dark clouds looked like they were about to burst with rain, I arrived at the abandoned factory.
The inside was as dusty as ever, filled with the smell of oxidized oil.
I immediately found a nearby workbench and decided to remove the glove from my right hand.
I'm already used to the exposed parts.
First, I'll try slowly opening and closing my fingers.
The malfunction wasn't fixed, and the movement stopped halfway.
What could be the cause?
I took out a light from my bag and shone it on my arm, peering inside.
It doesn't seem like any foreign objects are stuck.
…In that case, it must be a problem with the internal parts themselves.
I took out my tools and started disassembling my right hand.
I felt a sense of unease at disassembling my own hand.
I am now destroying myself.
If I were to disassemble all of this, would I break down?
Is that my 'death'?
I wonder, what kind of feeling would that be?
If I die, where will this consciousness disappear to?
And if it were reassembled once more, would this consciousness return?
Could that be called being alive?
While thinking about such things in the back of my mind as I disassembled it, I arrived at the cause of the malfunction.
The piston rod of the cylinder that distributes oil to the finger was bent, and oil was seeping out.
It's a part I removed once when I fixed Shiona's music box.
At that time, I used the oil in the cylinder to lubricate the gears of the music box.
It was only a small amount of oil, but it must have been a necessary amount for the intricately operating prosthetic finger.
So, even small flaws can accumulate into a large wound.
However, with the rod bent this far, even a half-hearted repair might result in the oil leak recurring.
The most reliable solution would be to replace this part entirely with a new one.
I stood up and decided to search the area.
Phyloid parts in various states of completion were scattered on the floor.
Here in the Phyloid factory, there's bound to be a part lying around that fits my mold.
With my right arm disassembled, I searched the factory.
There were many arm, leg, and torso parts scattered around the factory.
The head parts were so elaborate that, if you weren't careful, you could mistake them for the real thing for a moment.
From among them, I searched for something that would fit me.
Looking at my exposed right arm, I checked the model number of the part I needed.
That seems to be the model number of the required part.
I searched the scattered arm parts for the same model number.
Am I using something that's so rare?
Even after searching all the parts scattered around the factory, there wasn't one with the same model number.
The state of decay in this factory is much more advanced compared to the place where I woke up.
I can tell that this facility was abandoned a long, long time ago.
If that's the case, it's understandable that there aren't any parts with the same model number due to the different manufacturing era.
While anxiously continuing to search for parts, I discovered something marked 'AR115'.
Its appearance is almost identical to the shape of the part that was embedded in my arm.
However, the piston rod and shaft section are a bit long.
With this, it seems I can replace it with just a little bit of modification.
I placed the arm with 'AR115' attached on the workbench and began disassembling it.
After successfully removing the part, I compared it with the part that was originally embedded in me—'HR114'.
Apparently, an output terminal that didn't exist in 'HR114' has been added to 'AR115'.
There are no other changes besides that.
I immediately tried attaching that part to my arm.
Unlike when disassembling, the task of attaching it was a bit difficult.
While dropping the screws many times, I somehow managed to finish the installation.
When I moved my fingers, I was able to open and close them as before.
However, each time, a dissonant sound of the machines rubbing against each other echoed around.
It seems the lubricating oil has run out.
Seeking oil, I proceeded deeper into the factory.
As the smell of oxidized oil intensified, I came across a dark black drum.
When I opened them, they were all oxidized and unusable.
But in the very back, I found a relatively new drum.
When I opened it, there was a small amount of oil inside that was not very oxidized.
I scooped up the oil with the oil storage tank installed inside my arm.
Then, I returned the tank to its original location.
After a while, the oil was automatically extracted, improving the smoothness of the mechanical parts.
When I moved them, I could open and close my fingers without any dissonance.
I was able to fix it.
Looking at my smoothly moving fingertips, I felt a sense of clarity spreading deep within my chest.
I put my gloves back on, returned the tools to my bag, and left the factory.
Outside, the wind had become quite strong.
I hope it doesn't rain...
I hurried back to town.
—On the way.
A white object had fallen to the ground.
It fluttered as if being toyed with by the raging wind.
After staring at it for a while, I realized it was a cloak.
With the umpteenth flutter, I could see what was wrapped inside.
It had the shape of a person.
Could it be? I rushed over to it in a panic, knelt down on one knee, and gently turned back the cloak.
There was a severely injured young man.
Blood flowing from his wounded arm—I immediately knew he was human.
"A-Are you okay!?"
"Ugh... ugh..."
The young man groaned, as if reacting to my voice.
His body was painfully injured, and it didn't seem like he could stand up at all.
There were traces near the young man's feet, as if he had been crawling.
The traces were stained with blood, telling a story of hardship.
I have to help him.
A sense of mission seeped from my chest into my entire body.
"Hang in there, are you okay!"
I threw the bag off my shoulder onto the ground and helped the young man up.
Perhaps the movement caused him pain, as the young man grimaced and groaned even louder.
And as if clinging to something, he reached out his hand.
I reflexively offered my open right hand.
Through the glove, my mechanical hand was grasped.
Damn it—I inwardly cursed myself.
But the strength in his hand was so weak that I couldn't shake him off.
The young man slowly opened his eyes and looked at me.
"Y...you..."
"A-Are you okay? There's a town nearby. I'll carry you there right away."
"T...town..."
He muttered, repeating my words as if with vacant eyes.
Then, as if to confirm the hand he was holding, he traced the glove with his limp fingers.
I'm sure he's realized it.
He must have noticed the hard sensation, different from that of a human, through the glove.
But it doesn't matter.
This isn't a situation where I can afford to worry about that.
"...D...do you...l-live...in th-that town...?"
"T...town...live...?"
The young man repeats "town" as if it were a spell.
His words are weak, as if they're about to disappear at any moment.
I decided to take the young man back with me.
Maybe now, I can save this person.
I put my arm around his shoulder and dragged the young man along.
His steps were heavy, and it took a considerable amount of time to advance even ten meters.
But I wanted to help this person... I was filled with the desire to save him.
"You...how long...have you been in...town...?"
The man, who looked like he was about to faint at any moment, asked me.
"It's only been about a week."
"I see... I...see..."
I could feel the young man weakening over my shoulder.
If I don't keep him conscious, he might not come back.
"Hang in there, we'll be in town soon, very soon. It's not that big, but the people there are all warm."
I desperately spoke to the young man.
If I could talk about something that would interest him even a little, he wouldn't lose consciousness.
"We don't have a doctor, but we have books, so I'm sure we can figure out how to treat your injuries."
"...B...book...?"
"Yes! We have everything. I'm sure we can look up anything. So please, hang in there."
"...E...every...thing...?"
"Yes! Definitely!"
The young man took a long, slow breath and muttered softly.
"...Abandon me..."
I didn't understand what he said.
I couldn't help but stop in my tracks.
"...Leave me...just abandon me here..."
"T-there's no way I can do that!"
"I was...attacked by humans..."
"By humans...?"
"I was just...just traveling in search of an ideal...but, an ideal is just...a value..."
The young man took another long breath.
"Because of differences in values...humans...clash, antagonize, and fight...becoming relentlessly cruel...and violent..."
"T-that's not true, humans are warm, they share many things, and support each other."
"Ah, that is precisely the ideal..."
The young man exhaled all the breath he had taken, as if collapsing.
"...Hey, h-hang in there! Please, hang in there!"
Had he just lost consciousness, or was it something more...?
Unpleasant thoughts swirled around in my head.
I gritted my teeth, looked straight ahead, and started walking towards town.
To help this person, even a second sooner.
Before I knew it, rain started to fall, striking our backs fiercely.
Rainwater seeped into my gloves, but I couldn't afford to worry about that.
I frantically carried the young man into the church.
"Rei, what's wro... Wh-who is that!?"
Shiona greeted me, looking flustered.
"This person collapsed on the way! They're seriously injured!"
"I understand. Carry him to the back."
Led by Shiona, I carried the young man to a room with a bed.
When I laid him down on the white sheets, the rainwater and blood on his body mixed, spreading into a red stain.
There was no sign of the young man regaining consciousness.
"Rei, I brought some water."
I held the cup Shiona handed me to the young man's mouth.
I poured a little water in.
The young man's throat pulsed as he swallowed.
Even so, he didn't regain consciousness.
Compared to when I first met him, his complexion was considerably paler.
"Shiona, I'm going to the library! I'm sure they'll have medical books!"
Shiona started to say something, then bit her lip.
I was concerned about her behavior, but right now, every second counts.
I left the room, leaving Shiona behind.
Then, not caring about getting wet from the rain, I ran to the library.
"Rei, what's wrong? You're soaking wet."
Perhaps surprised by my sudden entrance, Tipi looked at me with wide eyes.
Without worrying about my ragged breathing, I asked.
"Tipi... do you have any medical books here?"
"Y-yes, we do."
"Please, can you take me there right away?"
"...Okay."
She must have sensed something.
Tipi immediately led me to the location.
"Is someone sick?"
Tipi asked, still facing forward, as we walked.
"Yeah... they're injured."
"Is it Rei? Shiona? Or..."
"No, it's someone Tipi doesn't know. So, you don't have to look so sad."
"But... but, but..."
Large drops of tears streamed down her cheeks.
That young man is someone Tipi doesn't know.
And yet, and yet...
To be able to shed tears for that person, Tipi, what a kind child you are.
"It's okay... it's okay."
I picked Tipi up and gently wrapped my hands around her.
Hot tears soaked through my clothes.
I could feel a small ache deep in my chest.
Enduring the pain, I rummaged through the medical books.
But no matter how many books we have, we're just amateurs.
What symptoms, what treatment, which book is even correct, we don't know.
I took as many books as I could carry from the library.
Not caring that the books were getting wet, I returned to the church.
When I opened the door, a melody flowed from within.
It was Shiona's singing.
The song alone was enough to recognize this as a sacred place.
"Shiona, how is he?"
"No... he hasn't woken up at all. I've done what I can, but..."
I ran to the young man's side.
The bandages wrapped around him must be Shiona's work.
But the young man's face was even paler than before.
I opened the medical books roughly.
I flipped through the pages, searching for something I could do.
But we were far too reckless.
No matter how wonderful the medical books are, they are just bundles of paper.
From the start, there was no way we, without any skill, could save someone with medicine.
We were too powerless, too insignificant.
Shiona quietly began to sing.
Unlike usual, it was a quiet melody, like a requiem.
"...Hmm...this song..."
The young man opened his eyes to Shiona's song.
But his gaze was empty, as if he were about to disappear at any moment.
"Do you know this song?"
"Ah, it's a nostalgic song... I used to sing it often..."
The young man's gaze traced the ceiling, then turned to me and Shiona.
Suddenly, the young man's expression softened.
"...Ah, so it was here... the world I was searching for was here..."
"What do you mean? The world you were searching for, what is it...?"
Perhaps the young man could no longer hear, as he didn't answer my question.
He just kept speaking unilaterally.
"...A path to coexistence... A world of harmony..."
After saying that, the young man quietly closed his eyes.
And then he didn't twitch again.
I felt something spilling out from the depths of my heart.
"Hey, Shiona, why won't he open his eyes? Is he sleeping?"
"The power I had just obtained is also rapidly fading..."
"Hey, why is that...? Is he just tired...?"
An indescribable sense of loss hung heavily in the depths of my heart like a dark cloud.
Pain ran through me as if the depths of my heart had been churned up.
Shiona hugged me from behind.
With that warmth, I was able to calm down a little.
Naturally, I placed my hands on Shiona's hands that were wrapped around my chest.
"Shiona... I, I..."
"Rei... Let's hold a funeral for him."
"A funeral...?"
"It's like a ceremony that's held when someone dies."
"When someone dies..."
With those words, I realized.
Ah, this person has died.
"That's the only way we can mourn the dead."
I couldn't move, listening to Shiona's words.
I couldn't quite process the concept of death that had appeared before my eyes.
"Well, there are preparations to be made, so will you help?"
I could only nod briefly.
We begin preparing for the funeral.
To mourn this young man whose name we don't even know.
As we proceeded with the preparations for the ceremony, there was only one thing that bothered me.
I had left Tipi, who had been crying so much, in the library.
Is Tipi still crying?
In that dark library. All alone.
"Rei, what's wrong?"
Shiona speaks to me as my hands stop while decorating the altar.
"Yeah... there's something I'm a little worried about."
"Something you're worried about? What is it? Is it about that man?"
"No, it's not that... it's about Tipi."
"Tipi-chan? What about Tipi-chan?"
"When I went to get the medical book, I told Tipi everything about that person. Then, Tipi started crying... and the worst part is, I left Tipi in the library like that."
"She turned pale and stayed that way?"
"Yeah, that's right. So, I was thinking that she might still be crying..."
"...Yeah, maybe. I'm sure she's crying in the back of the library."
I could easily imagine her like that.
Thinking that, I couldn't stand still.
"Shiona, do you mind if I go check on Tipi?"
Shiona gave me a sad-looking smile.
"There's still a little more to prepare for the funeral. So, I'd be happy if you came back soon."
"Yeah, I know. I'll be right back."
"...Okay. See you later."
Shiona still gave me a somewhat sad smile.
I finished decorating the altar and headed to the library.
With the medical book I had borrowed.
I walked through the town with a light rain, holding an umbrella.
The town's appearance was somehow different than usual.
As if something important was missing, lost...
I ran through the town of loss and hurried to the library.
The inside of the library was enveloped in silence, as if blocking out the sound of the rain.
--No, except for one thing.
The sound of a blue-haired girl sobbing from the back.
I followed the sound of that girl's crying.
The girl was in her usual place.
The girl was shedding tears while drawing as usual.
"Ray... Ray..."
When Tipi recognized me, she reached out her small hands.
As if in reply, I embraced her small body.
The moment I hugged her, her sobs grew a little louder.
"Ray... what happened to that person?"
I was choked by those words.
"Hey, Ray... Ray..."
"That person... hey... hey, hey..."
Silence had become the answer.
Perhaps Tipi understood everything, she began to cry loudly without holding back her sadness.
For that young man she had never met, large tears spilled out.
Ah, why is this?
What is this pain in my chest?
The depths of my chest are being stirred up into a mess.
It occasionally hurt and wounded my chest.
Surely it was something overflowing from the wound opened in my chest.
It's overflowing from my eyes with heat.
Before I knew it, I was crying.
I was shedding tears for the death of a young man I didn't even know.
Ah, I see.
This is 'sadness'.
It's a blue emotion.
It's the emotion that Tipi always carries in her heart.
It's such a painful and difficult thing.
Tears flow endlessly.
I don't know how to stop them.
--No, that's not right.
I didn't want to stop them.
I wanted to keep letting these overflowing hot droplets flow.
Surely these droplets are an act of healing sadness.
By washing away the sadness accumulated deep within our hearts, we maintain our sanity.
Thinking that, I felt that the weight accumulated deep within my chest had become a little lighter.
And at the same time, I also felt that the amount of overflowing tears had increased.
I cried.
We cried.
Sobbing, embracing each other, we cried.
Crying, crying, crying...
No matter how long it takes, the tears never dry up.
Just as the sadness never withers, the tears continued to overflow.
"Tipi, there will be a funeral soon."
"...A funeral? What... is that?"
"It's a ceremony to say goodbye to someone who has died. Shiona is preparing for it now."
"A goodbye...? What's a goodbye...?"
"It means you won't be able to see them anymore."
"Won't see them anymore... No!"
Tipi clings to me tightly.
Her arms were trembling slightly.
"I understand how you feel, Tipi. But you know, that's precisely why we have to say a proper goodbye, because we're sad."
"Since we can't see them anymore, let's say goodbye and see them off. Otherwise, I'm sure we'll be lonely and sad..."
"Lonely... sad..."
"Yeah, I'm sure we will. That's why we're sending them off. So we won't be lonely and sad... Can you do that?"
Tipi slowly separated herself from me.
With tears still flowing, she looks up at me.
"...I can. Tipi can do it."
"I see. That's great, Tipi."
When I pat her head, she seemed a little happy.
But those tears never stopped.
"Well then, shall we go...? Can you stand?"
"Yeah... Just a moment."
Tipi stood up and took her teddy bear in her hand.
Her ever-present stuffed animal is still in her arms.
We held hands and headed to the church in the rain.
“Merciful God, Father, we entrust to your hands this young man who has completed his journey in the hope of eternal life, believing in the only son you sent.”
“Take away all the burdens of this brother and sister who are leaving us, lead them to the dwelling prepared in heaven, and add them to the assembly of saints.”
“May we, who are in the sorrow of separation, also be supported by the hope of the resurrection promised by the Lord, and share eternal joy with the child who has been called to you.”
Shiona's voice echoed through the church, which was overflowing with attendees.
No one here should have ever seen that young man.
No one here should know that young man.
And yet, everyone gathered here was mourning the young man's death.
I thought, this is what it means to care for others, the connection between people.
Everyone clasped their hands in front of their chests and quietly closed their eyes in prayer.
Tipi and I followed suit.
Shiona's voice solemnly echoed through the church.
It sounded as if it were a song she was dedicating to the young man…
After the funeral, the young man was buried in the cemetery behind the church.
For one last farewell, the townspeople approached the coffin one by one, offering words of goodbye.
May you have a good afterlife…
Let's meet again someday…
Eternal rest…
They offered their respective words.
"Come on, Tipi."
It was our turn, and we approached the coffin.
Tipi stared intently at the coffin containing the young man.
The tears she had been shedding right up until the funeral were gone, and she just stared at the young man expressionlessly.
As if she had lost all emotion.
Just silently.
Staring intently, intently at the coffin.
Feeling uneasy at her state, I tried to call out to Tipi.
But a moment before I could, she opened her mouth.
She muttered in a small voice.
Several hours passed since then.
Rays of light shone through the gaps in the clouds where the rain had stopped, which was rare.
It was unusual for sunlight to shine through the gray, cloudy sky.
But I wasn't captivated by the beautiful scenery.
Because I was concerned about the expression on Tipi's face that I saw during the funeral.
That expression that was too empty to be called sadness.
I don't know what it means.
Even so, there's only one thing I think.
I want to be by her side.
I want to be by Tipi's side and talk to her.
And I want to heal that sadness.
That feeling grows within me.
As I try to open the door to the room, Shiona stops me.
“Yeah, I was thinking of going to see Tipi.”
“During the funeral, Tipi looked so sad, I got worried.”
“I see... but you know, I'm worried about you, Rei.”
“Yeah. Because you have such a sad expression, Rei.”
“Sad...?”
I touch my face with my hand.
“You can't tell that way, can you? Here, come over here.”
I was led by the hand into the living room and made to stand in front of a mirror.
“Look, you have a sad face, don't you?”
My face reflected in the mirror... was pale.
I understand well the meaning of what Shiona always said about Tipi being “pale.”
Right now, I have the same face as Tipi.
My heart is quiet, but strength is leaving my body, and my expression is sinking as if pulled by gravity.
“...Yeah, it's the first time I've seen my face like this.”
This is... sadness.
Even without shedding tears, when you're captured by this emotion, your expression becomes so “pale.”
“Someone has died. It's only natural to have such a face.”
What do I need these feelings for in life...?
They're bitter... painful... heavy, aching, and cold...
I look at Shiona's expression in the mirror.
But she wore a somewhat sad, ephemeral smile.
I'm sure she's putting on a brave face.
Just thinking that makes my chest ache.
"Tipi is important, too. But first, I want you to take care of yourself."
"Me... take care of myself?"
"Yeah, that's right. Rei taking care of Rei."
"Taking care of myself... I've never thought about it."
"Rei, you're so kind. That's why you probably prioritize others over yourself."
"But that's what I want to do."
"I'm a little sad about that. I don't want you to push yourself, Rei."
"I'm not pushing myself."
"Is that so? I can't think that way."
Shiona's arms entwined with mine.
"...I'm worried, you know."
I felt my heart rate increasing.
I don't know what it is.
But it was certainly stirring my emotions.
In that warmth, I felt kindness.
...No, more than kindness... I feel a different kind of warmth, different from what touches my skin.
Hey, Rei, how about some tea?
...Tea? Why?
When you drink something warm and fuzzy, your heart feels fuzzy too. It relaxes your mind and body, and it feels so good.
But Tipi...
Tipi-chan is probably shaken by the death of that person. But, I'm sure she can overcome it. So, let's leave her alone for a little while. Being alone is very important, you know?
Is that so?
Yes, I'm sure of it. Because if you don't, you can't become strong.
People can become stronger by overcoming walls and sorrows. But if they are helped by someone every time, they cannot grow easily. To help Tipi-chan grow, let's leave her alone today, okay?
Tipi is a weak being.
She's always crying.
But, if you say it's a chance to grow...
I'll accept it.
Shiona, will you make tea for me?
Of course. Will you sit in a chair and wait?
I sat on the sofa and waited for Shiona's tea.
After waiting for a while, a good scent filled the room.
Sorry to keep you waiting. Here's my special, heartwarming tea. Enjoy.
The offered teacup was filled with an orange-colored drink.
A faint sourness and a subtle sweetness waft through the air.
There you go. It's been a while since I've had a chance to talk with you like this, Rei.
Yeah, it has. A lot has happened...
Rei, how's your memory?
No, it still doesn't seem like it's coming back.
I see... But, there's no need to rush. You might just suddenly remember something.
Yeah, thanks... But, I feel bad.
Bad? About what?
I'm staying here, but I haven't been able to repay Shiona for her kindness at all.
That's not true. I'm just happy to have you by my side, Rei.
But that's not repaying you at all.
That's not all. You fixed the music box... and that's how I was able to sing.
But you were singing before that, Shiona.
But, it's very different with and without a melody. Remember when we played together in the plaza? Actually, I sang in that place many times.
In that place... alone?
Yeah. But, no one would listen to me at that time.
Even with such a wonderful singing voice? That's strange.
Hehe, thank you. But, that's just how it is. So, I was very happy when you brought the music box with you, Rei.
That's... I was just turning the music box.
That's what makes me happy. Just being next to you makes me happier than anything.
I feel the same way. I'm happy to be with you, Shiona.
......Hehe. Thank you. Rei, you've become so much more expressive.
Expressive? Me?
Yes. Your expressions are much richer than when we first met.
That was what I sought, what I desired.
It was what I had been longing for ever since I woke up.
Being told that by Shiona fills my heart.
The incomplete me is getting closer to being human... closer to Shiona, that's what she's telling me.
I'm sure it's because you're always smiling next to me, Shiona.
Is that so? I haven't done anything.
No, it's because you're here, Shiona. Thank you, I'm grateful.
If you're going to say that, then so am I. Thank you, Rei.
I'm the one who should be thanking you.
I'm the one who... Hehe, this is funny. We're just thanking each other over and over.
You're right. What are we even doing?
...But you know, it's strange.
What's strange?
I'm thinking that I wish this time could last forever... That's strange, isn't it?
...No, not at all. I was thinking the same thing...
...Can I come over there?
Shiona sits next to me.
A distance where I can feel her warmth.
We are closer than we've ever been.
Huh...? What is it...?
What's wrong?
Something's strange with my body. My chest is... thumping.
Could it be that I've broken down? I'd be troubled if it's a major malfunction requiring maintenance.
It's okay. I feel the same way. My chest has been thumping the whole time.
Huh? A-Are you okay? Does it hurt?
Yeah. It's a wonderful thing.
Shiona gently smiles shyly as she places her hand on mine.
Softly, as if enveloping it.
I respond by turning my wrist, so our palms meet... so our fingers can intertwine.
I feel Shiona's warmth even more strongly.
And that warmth warms the depths of my heart.
The depths of my heart are warm, like a gentle simmer...
My heart...? Here...?
Shiona's hand reaches for my chest.
The place she touched instantly became hot.
Shiona's hand feels so hot... I wonder why. Could it be a disease?
No, that's not it.
Do you know the cause, Shiona?
Yes, probably.
Tell me.
Hehe, what should I do?
Don't be mean. I'm curious.
Hmm... but you know, it's not just you, Rei.
The getting hot part?
Yes, that's right. My heart is also very hot right now.
You feel the same, Shiona?
Yes, the same. Maybe I'm even more seriously ill than you, Rei.
That's terrible! How can we cure it?
No, we can't cure it... and we don't need to.
My heart is hot, it's tight, it's painful, it's sad, but it's warm... and that's okay. That's good, Rei.
Shiona's overlapping hand became a little hot.
I grip her hand back.
Rei, please.
I want you to stay with me forever.
Yeah... will you stay with me forever and ever?
Yeah... I promise.
Thank you, Rei. I'm so happy... so, so...
Shiona rested her head against my chest.
I felt like my heart was being filled.
It's similar to the feeling of joy I felt before, but it's a much stronger emotion.
What do humans call this?
I wanted to ask Shiona, but I thought it would be insensitive to break this atmosphere.
So, just like that... I'll entrust myself and Shiona to time.
The sweet-smelling tea prepared on the table. We stayed like that until the steam disappeared.
The next day, I was getting ready to go out after finishing breakfast.
Shiona, who was washing the dishes, called out to me.
I was thinking of going to the library.
The library... are you going to see Tippy-chan?
Yes, that's the plan.
I'm sure Tippy-chan is still in the process of getting over it. So, shouldn't we leave her alone?
Yeah... but if I think about her being lonely and unable to overcome it, I can't just leave her alone.
Just like Shiona was by my side yesterday and made me feel warm, I think I can support her just by being near her.
It's okay. Tippy-chan isn't that weak.
Really...?
Yeah, I'm sure of it. More than that, Rei, I have a favor to ask. Won't you go to the plaza today?
To the plaza? Why?
"I have my music box... I thought we could sing again."
"Yeah, something sad happened, right? So, it's important to rest your heart."
"Rest my heart...?"
"We had a funeral, and I'm sure everyone in town is feeling down. So, don't you want to brighten everyone's spirits?"
"...Everyone in town? Of course, I do."
It's painful to see sad faces.
If I could, I'd like to heal that sadness.
"That's what our melody can do. I'm sure it will help the town regain its energy."
"I see... Do you think so?"
"Yeah, I'm sure of it. Come on, let's get ready."
Urged on by Shiona, I reach for the music box.
The music box, which I maintain every day, is always ready to play music.
We set off for the plaza.
It was a cloudy afternoon.
There were hardly any people there.
"There's no one here, Shiona."
"It's always like this at this time. Before you came, Rei."
"Before I came...?"
"I told you, didn't I? Ever since you started playing music, everyone has been listening to my songs. The people in town have been changing little by little. They're going out more, and interacting more. I feel like the connections between people are getting stronger little by little."
"Is it because I came...?"
“Yes, I think so too. Ever since you came, Rei, the people in town have been changing. In a good way, of course.”
Those were very happy words.
I am useful to someone.
That fact fills me with unstoppable joy.
“Rei, you look happy.”
“Yeah. Your cheeks are all loose.”
“My cheeks?”
“Yeah, here—”
Shiona's fingertip touches my cheek.
Just that makes me feel a warmth deep in my chest again.
“My face feels kind of hot.”
“Rei, are you blushing? Ahaha.”
My face gets even hotter.
It seems what Shiona is saying is right on the mark.
“Well then, Rei, shall we begin?”
“Yeah, are you ready?”
“Whenever you are.”
Shiona slowly closes her eyes.
I felt like I could look at that beautiful profile forever.
But just as much, I also want to hear Shiona's singing voice.
And so, I slowly began to turn the music box handle.
Shiona's singing voice rides on that melody.
The two melodies melted together, their beautiful tones resonating all around.
Soon, people began to gather.
The people who initially had slightly dark expressions gradually regained their smiles.
And before we knew it, a large circle of smiles had spread across the plaza.
Town child A:
Townsperson A:
Townsperson B:
Townsperson C:
Townsperson D:
The smiles and words of various people are flying around.
Ah, this is it.
This is what I was searching for.
People with joyful smiles.
Each time I see those smiles, my joy amplifies.
I was saddened that that girl wasn't in that circle.
The blue-haired girl in the back of the library.
The girl who never comes here.
The girl who remains shut up in that library.
I couldn't stop thinking about that girl.
Shiona's voice brought me back to my senses.
"Sorry, I was just lost in thought."
"I see... everyone's already gone home."
Looking around, the people who had been in such a large circle were now scattered.
It seemed I had been lost in thought for a very long time.
"What were you thinking about?"
"Hmm... no... it's nothing..."
"Shall I guess? It's about Tippy-chan, isn't it?"
She saw right through me so easily. So I nodded honestly.
"...Yeah, that's right."
"I knew it... are you really that worried about her?"
"Yeah, I'm worried. Because she's still such a small child."
"A small child, huh... I guess so."
"Besides, she's always all alone. There's no way she's not lonely."
"But she's always been like that. She's used to it now."
"That's not true."
"After all, Shiona also said so, didn't she? That the townspeople have changed since I came."
"Yeah, that's true..."
"Then, I want Tippy to change too. It's not right for her to be lonely."
I repeated what Shiona had taught me.
Hearing those words, Shiona's smile clouded over slightly.
She looked towards the library, pursed her lips for a moment, and then turned back to me with a smile.
"Let's go home, Rei?"
"It's going to rain from noon today. Come on, let's go home... okay? I'll make fluffy white soup."
Taking Shiona's hand, I was half-forced to leave the plaza.
Then, a few hours later.
Shiona called out to me again as I was about to leave the house.
"Um, I was thinking I'd like to read a book..."
"If it's books, there are a few that my brother used to read."
"Not those... well, it's a genre of book that I'm sure isn't here."
"What kind of genre is it?"
"Books about machines. I've become interested since I repaired Mad's the other day."
"I see. I'm glad that Rei is interested in something."
"Yeah, thank you. So, I'm going to go to the library."
"Does it have to be today?"
"Yeah, the sooner the better. I want to read it as soon as possible."
"But it's going to rain soon, you know?"
"The weather doesn't matter. I'll go even if it rains."
"But the book might get wet, you know?"
"It's okay, I'll take a bag with me."
"Hmm... then I'll go and borrow it for you."
"Huh? No, it's okay, I'll go myself."
"No, it's fine. I also have some shopping to do, so I'll go while I'm at it."
Saying that, Shiona returns to her room.
I wonder why.
I feel like Shiona is trying to keep me away from the library.
No, that's not it.
It would probably be more accurate to say Tipi.
I don't know what that means, but it seems like she doesn't want us to meet.
Shiona says it gently, but I can feel her feelings.
But, I wonder why?
"I'm ready, Rei. What kind of book should I borrow?"
"You probably wouldn't understand even if I told you, so I'll go with you."
"No, it's okay. You just relax, Rei."
"Then... I want you to borrow a book about electronic circuits."
"Electronic circuits, got it. Well then, I'm off."
Shiona went out.
Waiting for a few minutes.
It's probably about time Shiona is out of sight.
I reached for the door leading outside.
...That's strange.
It's not locked.
But the door wouldn't open no matter what.
It's as if it's bolted from the outside.
--Could it be, is that what's happening?
When Shiona left, she locked a lock that can only be locked from the outside, without me noticing.
That's why I can't leave from this door.
--But, why?
--For what purpose?
I returned to the living room, holding my head.
When I looked at the table, a piece of paper had been placed there before I knew it.
It's a note left by Shiona.
To Rei,
I think you were surprised that it was locked.
Do you remember me telling you that a nearby town was attacked?
So, I'm locking it as a precaution.
Please stay put.
I've prepared soup and bread for your meal.
Please heat it up and eat it.
To make sure I never go outside.
I've heard stories of humans who repeat plunder from that deceased young man too.
Perhaps those humans are coming near here.
If that's the case, going outside is dangerous.
I see. Shiona was worried about me.
But, if that's the case, then it's dangerous for Shiona to go outside too.
Shouldn't I, a man, have gone shopping instead?
--Don't try to deceive yourself....
It's certainly true that there are humans who plunder.
Even so, is it necessary to lock the door from the outside?
Rather, if it's locked from the outside, then the key to open it is also from the outside.
Entry into the house becomes easier.
--That's strange.
If she was really wary of humans who plunder, she wouldn't have sung in the plaza yesterday.
She wouldn't do something that would intentionally gather people.
If that's the case, then why?
--There's only one thing I can think of.
She locked me in.
To keep me away from Tipi.
There's no way Shiona would do something like this without thinking.
There must be a reason.
And I'm sure it's something she's doing for me.
...Could something have happened to Tipi?
Is she trying to keep it from me?
Something that's not good for me... so I won't be sad knowing about it...
I couldn't stand still.
I want to see Tipi. I want to make sure she's okay.
A blue girl, crying alone in the library.
I wanted to wipe away that girl's tears.
I look around the church.
There was a window in a considerably high position.
Even if I can climb up, there's no guarantee I can get out and down safely.
But that's the only way to get out of here.
Suddenly, a white cloth caught my eye.
A curtain swaying in the wind.
There are many of them in the room, long, large, and sturdy enough to cover the large windows.
I start removing the curtains from all the windows.
There's no sign of sunlight pouring down from the sky, which is covered in dark clouds.
When I tie the five curtains together on the table, they become quite long.
It's long enough to reach down to the first floor.
I tie the end of the curtain to the window bars.
I wrapped it around many times, checking the strength over and over.
It's okay.
It should be able to support my weight alone.
I tie the other end of the curtain to myself.
And with determination, I leaned out the window.
The ground visible from there looks very far away.
I feel a little faint, but I can't back out now.
Gripping the curtain tightly, I slowly lower my body.
Halfway down, a strong gust of wind shook me.
As my body swung like a pendulum, I did my best to cling to the curtain.
I waited several minutes for the wind to die down.
I took a deep breath and resumed lowering my body.
It probably took about ten minutes for my feet to finally reach the ground.
My body was so exhausted that I almost collapsed on the spot.
But I don't have time to rest here.
I started walking towards the library where the blue girl is waiting.
As if to hinder my thoughts, rain quietly begins to fall.
As if to moisten the parched town, its intensity gradually increases.
Not caring about getting wet, I continue walking without an umbrella.
The wet clothes stuck to my skin, making me feel uncomfortable.
I shielded my right hand, covered with a glove, from the rain.
Puddles started to form under my feet, and distant thunder could be heard.
My rough breaths occasionally carried rainwater into my mouth.
In contrast to my hot body, cold rain lashed at me from the outside.
Spitting out the rusty-tasting rain, I finally arrived.
At the library where the blue girl waits alone.
The inside is dimly lit, and no light leaks out at all.
Is she buried alone again in that dark sea of books?
Just thinking about it, my chest ached terribly.
I entered the entrance and proceeded to the depths where the blue girl is waiting.
"You came after all..."
A voice came from the back.
It wasn't Tippy's.
It was the very person who was keeping me away from here--.
"I wrote in a note that it's dangerous outside, so you shouldn't go out, right? Or maybe, you didn't see it?"
"No, I saw it."
"I see... So you knew and came anyway. Rei is a bad boy."
I could hear Shiona giggling.
But her expression wasn't clearly visible in the dimly lit building.
"Why did you lock me up?"
"Locked you up...? Well, I guess that's how it turned out. I'm sorry."
"There's a reason, isn't there? Would you mind telling me about it?"
"...A reason? The reason is simple. I don't want you to see her."
"You don't want me to see her...?"
"The blue girl up ahead."
"Tippy? Why?"
"I can't tell you that. It's top secret."
"Wait, I don't understand what you're saying. Why can't I see Tippy?"
"That's... because it's not allowed."
"That's not a reason! Tell me properly!"
"I can't tell you the reason."
I couldn't help but raise my voice.
At the same time, I realized that my chest was burning red.
Is this 'anger?'
Am I feeling anger towards Shiona...?
I don't mean to. I just want her to tell me the truth.
But my words just now seemed to have upset Shiona.
I can't see her expression clearly in the darkness, but the atmosphere coming from her has changed.
An air of hesitation, as if she's struggling to say something.
Shiona opened her mouth slightly, as if to say something... but then closed it again.
Then, tilting her chin down as if to look down, she whispered.
"...Because it will lead to unhappiness."
"Unhappiness? Who will be unhappy?"
"...Ray, me... and everyone living in this town, I guess."
"The people in town? Because we meet? I don't know what you're talking about."
"I'm sure you don't understand now. But you'll definitely regret it later."
"Why would I regret it? Hey, Shiona, tell me clearly. I'm not very smart, so I don't understand unless you spell it out for me..."
"In other words, it's like this..."
The sound of boots.
In the dimly lit entrance, Shiona approaches me.
The next thing I felt was warmth.
And, softness.
Shiona was hugging me.
"Shiona... huh? W-what...?"
"Please, Ray... won't you go home with me like this?"
"Like this...? What do you mean?"
"It's really not good for Ray and Tippy-chan to meet. To be precise, bad things will happen in a chain reaction if you meet. So..."
"Could it be that I made Tippy angry? Is that why she doesn't want to see me, or something?"
"No, it's the opposite. Tippy-chan loves Ray."
"Then--"
"That's why we can't meet. Please, understand."
The arms Shiona had wrapped around my waist tightened.
A sweet fragrance enveloped my entire body, making my head spin.
"...Is that, Shiona's wish?"
"Yes, it is. It's my heartfelt request."
"If I were to meet Tippy, what would Shiona think?"
"I would be very, very sad. I think I would feel blue and prickly."
"Why? Why does Shiona feel that way?"
Shiona pulled her face away from me and looked up at me with upturned eyes...
And said with a determined look.
"Ray... because I like you."
"L-like...?"
Those words almost made my mind shut down.
Sweet breath.
Lips that were about to touch.
Hands around my waist.
Touching body temperature.
We were as close as we could possibly be.
And, those words just now.
It was just a word, only two characters strung together, but it was filled with such deep emotion.
These words filled my heart with incredible force.
I was feeling a level of "joy" I had never felt before.
To be needed by someone. To have a certain level of emotion poured into me by a specific someone.
I don't know any greater joy than this.
And now, I am about to obtain that joy.
I put my limp arms around Shiona's back.
Shiona accepts it.
Warmth increases deep within my chest.
"Shiona, I..."
"Yes, Ray. I understand. That's why, let's go home..."
Shiona's hand is connected to mine.
I turned on my heel and started walking towards the library exit.
"...Thank you, Ray. But you know, this is for the best. Because this is for Ray."
I felt a sense of discomfort at Shiona's words.
Shiona called out to me with a puzzled look as I suddenly stopped walking.
"Shiona, you just said that, didn't you? 'For me.'"
"Yes, I certainly did say that."
"That's not right, Shiona."
"Not right? What's not right, Ray?"
"If you're saying it's for me, then this is wrong."
"It's not wrong. Doing this is for you, Ray."
"It is wrong. Because I'm happy when I'm helping someone. I'm here to be useful to someone. But now, I'm trying to disappear from the person I can help. That's not my joy, and it's not for me. So, who is this for then?"
"Shiona, I'm going to Tipi's place. It's for no one but myself. If this makes someone unhappy, it's my fault. But even if that's the case, I won't stop. Because that's the result I wanted."
I let go of Shiona's hand, and I pushed forward through the entrance again.
Shiona's voice didn't reach my back.
Shiona just stared, without saying a word, with a sad expression.
I passed through the rain-scented entrance and walked deeper into the library.
I could feel the moisture on the soles of my shoes being absorbed into the carpet with each step.
The dry library air clung to my wet skin.
I continued to feel inexplicably sick.
That might be related to what happened with Shiona just now.
My chest ached, as if I had swallowed something heavy.
Shiona's face flashed through my mind again and again.
Every single one of them, wearing a sad smile.
Why did things turn out like this?
Why did I do such a thing?
Waves of regret washed over me.
But I couldn't stop walking.
--That girl is further in.
A girl who is always alone.
A girl who is always blue.
A girl who is always crying.
I couldn't bring myself to leave that girl alone.
That's why I'm walking down this hallway.
Paintings were hung on the walls of the hallway.
The paintings that Tipi-chan paints one of each day.
In the painting drawn on the brand new paper, a single girl was depicted.
I immediately knew who that girl was.
A girl drawn small and alone in the large paper.
Tears streamed down her cheeks.
All of the recent paintings had the same composition.
A painting of a solitary girl crying.
Seeing that painting, my chest ached terribly.
The girl had been alone all this time.
I felt like I understood her sadness.
I wanted to quickly wipe away that sadness.
I wanted to tell her that she wasn't alone.
I wanted to tell her that I was by her side.
Dragging my wet soles, I proceeded down the long hallway.
As I gazed at the paintings hung at a height Tipi-chan could reach, I continued forward.
At that moment, I suddenly felt a sense of incongruity.
It wasn't because of the content of the paintings.
The problem was the number of paintings.
No matter how you look at it, Tipi-chan is a very young girl.
Even if she drew a picture every day, could she really have drawn this many?
...Perhaps there were days when she drew several pictures in a day.
Even so, the number of these paintings is impossible.
Was the girl that lonely?
Did she have nothing else to do but draw pictures?
Ah, why did I leave the girl alone?
How many tears did I make her shed because of that?
The amount of tears in the girl in the paintings increased with each passing day.
It seemed to represent how the girl's sadness was deepening.
I hurried.
To the girl who was probably crying alone in the depths of this place.
To heal that sadness.
And to wipe away those tears.
To hold the girl. To hold her body in these two hands.
I walked quickly, almost out of breath, towards the deepest part of the library.
The girl wasn't there, where she always should have been.
Her teddy bear, which she's always clinging to, wasn't there either.
All that was there was an unfinished drawing and crayons.
In the unfinished drawing, there was a picture of a girl crying all alone.
--Where could Tipi-chan have gone?
I searched around the bookshelves, but she was nowhere to be found.
Could she be somewhere in this library?
Or perhaps outside this library?
I don't know the truth.
I won't know until I try to find Tipi-chan.
I started walking.
Weaving through the bookshelves, I searched for the figure of the blue-haired girl.
The vast library grounds are not suitable for searching for someone.
In addition to that, there's this darkness.
You can't find anything just by looking from the edge of the bookshelf.
I'll have to check step by step, with my own feet.
I walked between the bookshelves, from the back of the library towards the entrance.
Before I knew it, the clothes that should have been wet were starting to dry.
And it was about the time my hair had completely dried...
I finally managed to find the figure of that girl.
The girl was standing on a large stepladder, arranging books on the shelf.
The girl is a resident of this library, and also serves as its librarian.
She must be returning the books that the townspeople have returned to their original locations.
It's a harsh thing for this little girl to do.
The thousands of bookshelves in this library are stacked to the height of the ceiling and connected.
I don't even want to think about the number of all the books.
The girl faces such a large number of books and manages them like this every day.
All alone, inside this library.
Thinking about that, I couldn't help but feel a tightness in the depths of my chest.
Tipi-chan, stretching on the stepladder, returning a book bigger than her face to the shelf.
After finishing that task and taking a breather, Tipi-chan turned her face towards me.
"...Rei! ...W-w-w-w-what..."
Tipi-chan, noticing my presence, lost her balance on the stepladder.
"Careful, Tipi-chan!!"
The stepladder falls.
Tipi-chan's hand reaches out.
Responding to that hand, I stretched out both of my hands.
--The impact pierces through my chest to my back.
When I realized it, I was holding Tipi-chan in my arms, falling backwards onto the floor.
"Rei... you came, Rei...!!"
Tipi-chan rubbed her cheek against my chest over and over.
Relieved, I stroked Tipi-chan's head.
Her soft hair welcomed my hand.
"Tipi-chan, are you hurt anywhere? Are you injured?"
"Yeah, I'm okay. Does Rei hurt anywhere?"
"I'm fine. Thank you for your concern."
"You saved Tipi-chan... Rei, I love you..."
The little girl's hands gripped my clothes tightly.
I felt a slightly wet sensation and warmth on my chest.
Tipi-chan is shedding tears.
But it looked like tears different from usual.
Surely they are tears of relief.
I must be able to lighten Tipi-chan's heart a little by being here.
Thinking so, joy rushes through me.
"Tipi-chan was arranging books. I'm a good girl, right? Good girl?"
"Yes, you're a good girl. A very good girl."
"Hey, pet me. Because I'm a good girl, pet Tipi-chan's head."
"Yes... Tipi-chan is a good girl, a good girl..."
I stroke her silky hair.
"Yay... Rei is petting my head. Tipi-chan is so happy..."
"Do you always arrange books?"
"Yeah. I'm repairing the books. Because I want lots of different people to read them."
I look up at the bookshelf.
Certainly, some of the books look quite old.
Some have worn spines or are discolored.
Tipi-chan is repairing these...?
I remember wetting the books in the rain.
If I handle them roughly, it will increase Tipi-chan's work like this.
I vowed from the bottom of my heart to treat them with care.
I sit up and lean my back against a nearby bookshelf.
"I'm sorry I'm late."
"It's okay... because Rei came here like this."
"Were you okay by yourself?"
"No... I was very, very lonely."
"Were you crying?"
"Yeah... yeah, yeah..."
Tipi-chan presses her face against my chest.
Occasionally, I could hear her sobbing.
"It's okay, because we'll be together forever now."
"Forever? Rei, will you stay with Tipi-chan?"
"Yeah, that's right. I'll try to come to the library as much as possible."
"Won't you sleep with me?"
Tipi-chan raised her face.
Large tears were welling up in her eyes.
"That's a little difficult. I'm currently in Shiona's care."
"But, I'll come every day. That should make you less lonely, right?"
"Yeah... but, the nights are so lonely."
"The nights, huh..."
"It's dark and quiet... Sometimes Tipi-chan thinks she might be all alone in the world."
"That's not true. That's not true..."
All I could do was hug Tipi-chan.
A sweet fragrance emanated from Tipi-chan.
A sweet fragrance different from Shiona's.
"Yeah, I know... Tipi-chan is happy just that you come here like this. Hey, Rei. Can I ask you a favor?"
"Yeah, what is it? Tipi-chan."
"Will you help me?"
"Yeah... of course, it's the least I can do."
I stood up and took Tipi-chan's hand.
Pushing a cart filled with several books, we strolled through the library.
"Next... um, a book called 'The Philosophy of Mind and Body'"
"In that case, it's Easy 493, third shelf from the top, thirteenth book from the right."
When I told her the title of the book, Tipi-chan immediately said where it was.
It was as if she knew every book in this library.
In the place she told me, there was indeed a gap for one book.
When I put it in, it fit perfectly.
Tipi-chan wasn't just saying things randomly.
She was showing me the location of the book with certainty.
I became interested and decided to ask a slightly mean question.
"Hey Tipi-chan, can I ask you something?"
"Do you remember the opening part of this novel?"
What I handed her was a rather old-fashioned novel.
Tipi-chan stared intently at the title, and began to recite as if opening a book in her mind.
"'Looking down, there was a height of five stories. Cream-colored bricks were laid right next to the school building, creating a walkway that looked pleasant for a stroll. Right next to the walkway was a flower bed, and even from this height, you could see the colorful flowers. If I were to throw myself from here, would the cream color and the flowers all be stained with my dirty blood?'"
Tipi-chan recited it without a single word out of place.
It matched the handwritten text in the novel perfectly.
"Could it be that you remember all the books here?"
"Hmm... I don't know."
"Then, what about this book?"
After glancing at the book I handed her, Tipi-chan began to recite fluently.
"'The human body is composed of approximately 206 bones, starting from the head with the occipital bone, frontal bone, temporal bone, parietal bone, sphenoid bone, ethmoid bone, malleus, incus, stapes, inferior nasal concha, lacrimal bone, nasal bone, vomer, maxilla, palatine bone, zygomatic bone, mandible, hyoid bone, and from there connecting to the cervical vertebrae, then spreading to the thoracic vertebrae, lumbar vertebrae, sacral vertebrae, coccygeal vertebrae, ribs, and sternum.'"
"...Then, what about this one?"
I handed her another handwritten book, this one titled "The Complete Pi Encyclopedia."
"What's the opening of this 'Soulless Child Theory'?"
"'All things are finite, and even the soul is no exception. A child born after the soul has withered will be a vessel without a soul. -Edward Morgue'"
Tipi-chan has memorized all the books here.
But, why?
Even with tremendous memorization skills, she would first need to read these books.
Even if she kept reading every day, she could never finish reading this sea of books.
What on earth is going on...?
"Ray, what's wrong?"
"Oh, it's nothing. Come on, let's put the next book away."
There's no point in thinking about something I can't find an answer to.
For now, I'll focus on helping Tipi-chan with her work.
After returning all the books to the shelves, we sat down in our usual spot.
"Ray, thank you for helping me."
Tipi-chan is being even more affectionate with me than usual.
Is it a reaction to not being able to see me until now?
The way she clings to me is cute and endearing.
"It's okay, Tipi-chan. You're always doing this by yourself, right?"
"Yeah... I'm always, always alone. I'm lonely."
"...How long have you been alone?"
Perhaps that was a forbidden question.
Tipi-chan looked up at me sadly.
"Tipi has always been alone, for a long time."
And then, Tipi-chan told me her story.
A sad tale of how Tipi-chan came to be alone.
"Papa, Mama."
It was a story from when Tipi-chan's parents were still in the library.
The girl loved them very much.
She loved her kind mother and father very much.
Her mother was always smiling and gently hugged Tipi-chan.
Her father was always organizing books, gently watching the two of them.
"Tipi is still such a spoiled child."
Her father takes out an electronic device for books from the desk.
"Oops, that's right. Tipi-chan liked this one better, didn't she?"
He puts away the electronic device with a wry smile and takes out a "book" made of paper instead.
The technology of printing has already become obsolete, and now it is a precious cultural relic.
"Welcome, Tipi-chan."
She is called onto her mother's lap and sits down happily.
And on Tipi-chan's lap is a bear plushie that her parents chose for her.
Tipi enjoyed every day.
She enjoyed the days she spent with her beloved mother and father.
And there wasn't a day she didn't feel happy.
Her mother always praised the pictures Tipi drew.
"You're sure to be an artist in the future. Your father is so proud."
Her father always had hope for Tipi's future.
If only such days could continue forever.
I want to stay together with the three of us, just like this.
Tipi always thought so.
Before she knew it, her parents started to frown more often.
Tipi didn't like that expression.
The town also seemed restless.
The adults were all talking about something.
But the young Tipi didn't understand what it meant.
She just had a growing anxiety that her life as it was would be destroyed.
One day, the phone rang.
The sound sounded very sad to Tipi.
The father who answered the phone began to frown.
That expression that Tipi didn't like.
The father who hung up the phone was talking to the mother about something.
After a while, the discussion turned into an argument.
They were arguing about something.
The only thing I understood was that seeing the two of them arguing made me very sad.
"Tipi, will you listen to me?"
After a while, her mother looked at Tipi with a serious expression.
Behind her was her father--and packed luggage.
Tipi intuitively understood that her life as it was would not continue.
"Right now, terrible things are happening in the world."
"Many people are scared and can't sleep at night. Tipi wouldn't want that, would she?"
"There are children all over the world who feel that way. Your mother wants to help them if she can."
"Yes... I knew Tipi would say that... So, Tipi, what I'm about to say is important. It's okay if you don't understand, but will you listen?"
"Actually, your father and I have to go far away to help those children. Even if we go, we may not be able to change the situation... But there is a possibility."
"No. Much, much farther. It's so far that it takes days or weeks to get there."
The father stopped Tipi, who was about to go to her room.
"Tipi doesn't need to pack for the trip."
"That's not it... Actually, Tipi, your father and mother are going to that place alone."
"The two of you...? What about Tipi...?"
The parents look at each other.
Tipi felt something from her parents' sad faces.
Suddenly, tears began to overflow.
"I'm sorry, Tipi, but we can't do that."
"The place your mother and I are going is very dangerous. We don't want to take you to such a dangerous place, Tipi. Because your mother and father love you very much."
"No... I don't want to... I don't want to! Tipi is going too..."
The parents gently hugged Tipi.
"I'm sorry, Tipi... But your mother and I still have to go."
"I'm sorry, Tipi... It'll be okay, we'll definitely be back soon."
"We'll be back soon... So you won't be lonely, we'll be back right away..."
"Tipi, be a good girl and stay home. And show us your drawings again."
"Oh, that's right. Draw one picture every day. What you saw, what you heard, what you learned, what you felt. When we get back, will you tell us about it?"
"That's right. I'll also turn many stories into books on my trip. I'll come back to tell them to Tipi."
"Yes, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. I promise, so..."
The three family members hugged each other.
To heal that parting, whose duration was unknown--.
How much time had passed since then.
Tipi continued to draw, just as her father had told her.
With each picture she drew, she pasted it on the wall. So that her parents would see it as soon as they came back.
What she saw...
What she heard...
What she learned...
What she felt...
But that was soon filled with thoughts of her parents.
I want you to hug me, pat my head, call my name, hurry... I want to see you...
My heart is dyed blue, so blue.
The girl continued to draw, shedding tears...
Tipi told me about her sad past, shedding blue tears of sorrow.
Her small shoulders are trembling faintly.
A girl enduring sorrow before my eyes.
I can't fathom how great her sorrow is.
Probably because I've never felt such sorrow before.
So I can't understand Tipi's feelings.
But I should be able to heal her sorrow.
By holding her small body.
Surely.
Tipi sits with her back against the wall.
I reach out to her delicate body.
When I touch her shoulder, Tipi's body jumps slightly.
It's not rejection.
She just seems a little surprised by the sudden action in the darkness.
"It's okay, Tipi. It's okay."
"Hey, Ray, you won't disappear from Tipi's sight, will you?"
"Yeah, I won't disappear."
"You won't leave Tipi alone?"
"Yeah, I won't leave you alone."
"You won't make Tipi lonely?"
"Yeah, I won't make you lonely."
"You won't make Tipi sad?"
"Yeah, I won't make you sad."
"Will you cherish Tipi?"
"Yeah, I'll cherish you."
"Will you hug Tipi?"
"Yeah, I'll hug you."
"Will you hold Tipi?"
"Yeah, I'll hold you."
"Will you pat Tipi's head?"
"Yeah, I'll pat your head."
"Will you hold hands with Tipi?"
"Yeah, I'll hold your hand."
"Will you stay with Tipi forever?"
Tipi's eyes faintly glow in the darkness.
The shoulder I touched was burning with feverish heat.
I embraced Tipi's body--.
"Oh, you two are getting along well."
The voice that echoed in the darkness didn't belong to a girl trying to heal her sadness.
It was Shiona, who should have parted ways with us at the entrance.
Before I knew it, Shiona was standing beside us.
With a smile that I could make out even in the dim light, Shiona approached us directly.
"But, you know, being too close is also a problem. You're a young man and woman at a sensitive age."
Shiona restrained the hand I had extended towards Tipi.
"Y-Yeah..."
Tipi's face, which had been seeking that arm, twisted in sadness.
I couldn't help but raise my voice at Shiona.
"Shiona, what are you doing!"
"What's wrong? Why are you so excited? You have to consider the implications of physical contact with a young girl."
"That's not it. Tipi is sad... I'm just trying to heal her sadness, even a little."
"Sad? About what?"
"About her parents not coming home yet! Tipi has been all alone for so long. She's been feeling lonely all this time!"
"That's reality, so it can't be helped."
"Can't be helped? What does that even..."
Shiona walks up to Tipi.
And looks at Tipi, who is small and grieving.
"Tipi-chan? It's sad, but Tipi-chan has always been all alone, you know? Even now, and forever into the future."
She said that with a smile, in her usual tone.
"Shiona, what are you saying..."
"Tipi-chan, you understand too, right? Your father and mother aren't coming back anymore, are they?"
"Shiona... stop it... don't say such terrible things..."
"You've realized it already, haven't you? You just don't want to admit it."
"...No... no... I don't want to..."
"Tipi-chan's father and mother..."
"...Shiona... stop..."
"Are already de──"
"Stop ittttttt!!"
My voice echoed through the library.
My whole body was burning up.
My breathing became ragged, and I felt a pain deep in my head.
My clenched teeth were also grinding and groaning.
My vision flickered, and I could barely stand.
And at the same time, I was certain.
My chest felt red and prickly. The emotion that Mad always had.
This is the emotion called 'anger'.
I am feeling anger at the injustice happening before my eyes.
Now, the blue girl's hope has been severed.
With Shiona's heartless words, Tipi was hurt.
Tipi is crying with a voiceless voice.
Her face is all crumpled up.
Turning her sadness into large drops, letting them flow down her cheeks.
With her small body, she is desperately telling the story of her bottomless sorrow.
Shiona added insult to injury.
"Because that's how it is, right? How long do you think it's been since Tipi-chan's father and mother came home?"
"Tipi-chan, you draw pictures every day, right? How many is it now?"
"Stop it..."
"Doesn't it make you sad to draw every day? How many more pictures do you have to draw for your father and mother to come back?"
"Sto-op it..."
"It's useless no matter how much you cry. Tears only flow to comfort yourself. Just because they flowed doesn't mean anything will change."
"...Please stop..."
"That's just self-satisfaction. You're crying because someone will be nice to you if you cry, right? That's just running away from reality."
"...Plea-ase stop..."
"Let's realize it already. Your father and mother aren't coming back. Never again. Tipi-chan will never be able to see her father and mother again."
"Also, let me tell you. Rei is only here because he feels sorry for Tipi-chan. He doesn't have the love that your father and mother poured into you. Only pity is binding Rei here. Tipi-chan, do you understand? You are all alone."
"Stop it----------------"
A resounding roar.
When that voice echoing off the walls died down, only Tipi's sobs remained.
Tipi looks up at Shiona with hollow eyes.
I felt like the light she had just a little while ago had disappeared.
"Rei, spoiling and comforting are different."
"That's not true... that's not true..."
"Rei, accept reality too. Tipi-chan's parents are no longer in this world."
"That's wrong... that's not true..."
"Then why haven't they contacted her even once? They haven't even sent a single letter to Tipi-chan, who they doted on and loved so much?"
"That's... I'm sure they're just busy and don't have time to contact her..."
"If they knew the other person was worried, they wouldn't begrudge that time. Especially if it were their beloved child. The fact that they haven't means--"
"Stop it... please stop..."
"--Tipi-chan's father and mother are already dead."
I froze.
Shiona's tone was as gentle as usual, and her smile was the same as always.
I wish she would have said it in a cruel, emotionless voice.
In that abnormal atmosphere, I couldn't say anything more.
Shiona's face, as she turns to face Tipi again, is smiling.
"Tipi-chan, your only family is your father and mother. But those two are never coming back. That's why no matter who you're with, you'll never be truly fulfilled. Even if Rei is with you, you can't become a family. That's an unchangeable fact. You'll always be alone."
Shiona turns on her heel and heads towards the entrance.
On the way, she looks back at me just once.
But her eyes remained fixed on the floor.
"Rei... it's all for your sake."
Shiona left the library, leaving only those words behind.
Silence filled the hall.
Now, even Tipi's sobs were gone.
I was furious and exhausted by Shiona's words and actions.
I couldn't even stand up.
But I couldn't leave the girl alone like this.
The girl must be thinking.
That she is all alone in the world.
That she has to live in solitude.
I didn't want her to think that way.
I wanted her to know she wasn't alone.
My feelings for Tipi aren't pity.
It's definitely not pity.
I repeat it over and over again.
As if telling myself, over and over again.
I reach out and place my hand on Tipi's shoulder.
I pull her delicate shoulders close to me.
Tipi initially flinched as if surprised, but then settled against my chest.
She pressed her face against me, stifling her sobs.
I gently stroked her trembling shoulders again and again.
If only I could alleviate even a little of the sorrow she holds in that small body...
I don't know how long we stayed like that.
We sat there, nestled close to each other.
After a while, when I lost all sense of time.
Tipi wobbled to her feet and started walking as if searching for something.
Tipi doesn't respond.
It's her sketchbook and crayons.
Tipi comes back to me holding those two things.
She sits down, leaning her back against my stomach.
Tipi still doesn't respond.
Instead, she flips through the pages of her sketchbook.
With a fresh page as her canvas, Tipi picks up a crayon.
And without hesitation, she runs the crayon across the paper.
What she draws is a cute, age-appropriate picture.
The first thing she drew was a picture of a blue girl.
There are tear tracks on her cheeks.
Her eyes are tinged with red.
I gently stroked Tipi's head.
Lowering her gaze again, Tipi runs the crayon across the paper.
Next, it seems she's drawing me.
My hand is placed on the girl's head.
It seems to be a scene of me gently stroking her head.
And then--
It was Shiona.
She's watching the girl from a short distance away with a scary face.
That was Shiona for Tipi.
Even from my perspective, Shiona before Tipi probably looks like that in the picture.
Why did Shiona do such a thing?
Shiona said it.
That it was all for my sake.
I don't know what that means.
No, I didn't want to understand.
I don't understand what 'for my sake' means after making Tipi cry.
Can I be happy by making someone else unhappy?
No, there's no way that could be true.
It shouldn't be allowed to happen.
As if to erase Shiona's words clinging to my ears, I hug Tipi.
Her voice is faint and about to disappear.
But deep down, I felt a hint of joy.
I think while looking at the picture.
Could this be Tipi's way of avoiding sadness?
It is said that people dream at the end of the day.
It is said that this is to organize the memories of the events of that day.
For Tipi, perhaps this picture is that.
The events of that day--
Including the good and the bad, she draws everything in a picture.
By doing so, she organizes her memories and calms her mind, perhaps.
In fact, Tipi's expression has softened somewhat.
As the picture progresses, her sadness subsides.
As if she were passing her sadness onto the picture.
Tipi, having stood up, took my hand.
As I followed her hand, I arrived at a wall covered with pictures.
She says she draws one picture a day.
The number of pictures was enormous.
Tipi pasted the picture she drew today on the very edge.
Another one of Tipi's pictures has been added.
The wall full of pictures felt like a diary showing this girl's loneliness.
Tipi must have spent her time alone entirely on this story.
To think she's been dealing with such a sad story all alone...
Thinking that, something welled up from the bottom of my heart.
Looking at those sorrowful eyes, I unintentionally choked up.
Instead of answering, I embraced Tipi.
After a while, I heard quiet breathing.
I compared Tipi, who was sleeping in my arms, with the picture diary on the wall.
Could it be that this picture book is Tipi's heart itself?
I fell asleep while thinking about such things.
This is the church where I live.
I'm standing in front of the familiar white, large door.
I pushed open that door with both hands.
The chapel that continues inside is enveloped in surprising silence.
--No, it's not complete silence.
Because the sound of quiet sobbing reached my ears.
I rushed through the chapel.
Then, I came face to face with the person who was sobbing.
It was someone who always had a smile on their face.
It was Shiona.
Shiona was crying, her delicate shoulders trembling.
I couldn't hide my surprise at that.
--Why are you crying?
I didn't understand the reason.
But the fact is that Shiona is crying in front of me.
Those tears are not fake.
Even so, there was nothing I could do.
...No, that's not true.
There must be something I can do.
I reach out my hand.
My fingertips were reaching towards Shiona's eyes.
I probably can't stop those tears.
But I can wipe away the tears that have already fallen.
That's all I can do, but--.
I reach out my fingertip towards a large drop.
Halfway there, my hand stopped.
My fingertips are made of machine.
The extended index finger has a metallic sheen...
That's right.
I had forgotten.
No, I wanted to forget.
I am not human.
A manufactured being.
Why is this happening?
Am I not even allowed to wipe away the tears of someone I care about?
Shiona is crying.
Continuing to shed tears.
Is this a sadness that Shiona has never shown before?
But I can't stop or wipe away those endless tears.
Then why am I here?
Being here, what can I do for Shiona?
I couldn't find the answer.
I couldn't move the mechanical hand I had extended any further...
--Immediately after, a discordant sound of metal scraping echoed around us.
The ear-splitting sound echoed intermittently.
And then, my extended fingertip--.
That part crumbled and fell to the floor.
The collapse that started from the fingertip spread to the palm--the wrist--the arm--the shoulder.
Parts all over my body are falling apart.
Before long, it became difficult for me to even stand there, and I fell to the floor.
My legs, my torso, are turning into scrap.
Scrap metal is piling up around me.
I couldn't even make a sound, and had no choice but to accept the collapse.
Shiona is still crying.
Crying, stifling her voice.
I can no longer even extend my mechanical hand.
Because there's no longer even an arm or fingertip there.
The collapse corrodes my entire body, reaching even my head.
I don't feel any pain.
I shouldn't feel anything.
But...
I felt a pain deep in my chest that should no longer exist.
The last thing I saw as my vision crumbled was Shiona's sad expression and tears.
Eventually, I became just a pile of metal--.
A mountain of scrap.
--And then, I wake up.
I was shouting something, but I don't remember.
My breathing is ragged.
I hurriedly check my surroundings.
A dimly lit, dusty space.
The sticky, lukewarm air clings to me.
And the thick books lined up on the shelves.
This was the library.
I must have fallen asleep yesterday and woken up this morning.
I hurriedly remove my gloves and check my right hand.
The hand that should have crumbled just now was still there as always.
But, just like in the dream, it's made of machine.
On my lap, Tippy was already fast asleep.
Her innocent sleeping face doesn't betray the sadness of yesterday.
It seems I was having what humans call a dream.
During sleep mode, past records are sometimes glimpsed in order to organize the memory area.
But what I just saw was probably something like a prediction derived from experience and memory.
Does that mean this kind of possibility is hidden in the future... that's what was calculated?
Even so, how sad.
I still couldn't calm the unrest in the depths of my chest.
Why do Shiona's tears disturb me so much?
And why am I so powerless?
I'm not real.
I knew that.
I thought I knew it.
But even so, I want to make them laugh.
I want to make Shiona, Tippy, and everyone in town laugh.
But, I can't do it.
I can guess the answer, but I don't want to admit it.
--It's because I'm artificial.
The only truth I can't resist, no matter what.
But even so, I still wished for it.
I want to make everyone around me smile.
But, I can't make it happen.
When I try to make Tippy smile, Shiona-chan won't smile.
When I try to make Shiona-chan smile, I can't wipe away Tippy's tears.
How difficult it is.
Isn't there a better way to make everyone smile?
While looking at Tippy's sad sleeping face, I repeated it over and over in my heart.
I stroke Tippy's head with my fingertip.
Her smooth hair lets my fingertip pass through to the ends without tangling.
A sweet scent spreads.
"Unn... unnn..."
Is she dreaming? Tippy let out a small voice.
Looking at her innocent sleeping face, my desire to protect her grows stronger.
But, how?
While looking back and forth between my mechanical right hand and Tippy's face, I was at a loss.
I always wished that this gentle time would last forever.
--But, it couldn't be.
A strange sound echoed from afar.
Footsteps echoed as if many people were walking at the exact same time.
And, faintly, the sound of screams and something being destroyed.
Those two things crushed even my small wish.
I hurriedly put on my glove on my right hand.
"W-What... Rei, what is it...?"
Tippy woke up to the abnormality.
An anxious expression that wasn't there until just now spread across Tippy's face.
"I don't know... but it seems like something happened."
"Something? What is something?"
"I have no idea. But I'm sure it's not a good situation."
I stood up and pointed my toe towards the aisle of the library.
"...Rei? Where are you going?"
"I'm just going to check things out."
"No... don't go, Rei."
"It's okay, I'm not going anywhere. I'm just going to check things out on the roof for a little while."
"No... I don't want you to go..."
Tippy hugged me and shed tears.
She must be superimposing my parents' image onto me.
"It's okay. It's okay, Tippy."
"N-No... no..."
"Have I ever broken a promise with you, Tippy?"
"That's, that's right. When I said I'd go see you, I always did, right?"
"So it's okay. I'll take a look from the roof and come right back."
"...Okay. But, come back quickly, okay?"
"Yeah, of course."
I made a promise with Tippy and headed to the library roof.
What I reached after climbing the long spiral staircase was an old, rusted door.
There's no sign it's been used for a long time.
When I opened it, a grating, unpleasant sound echoed in my ears.
Without minding, I pushed the door open.
...At the same time.
An anomaly jumped into my eyes.
Black smoke was rising from all over town.
The scream-like sounds weren't a mishearing; they were coming from the mouths of townspeople fleeing from something.
And chasing after those townspeople were multiple figures clad in soiled cloaks.
Silently, they just walked while holding firearms--yet, with efficient coordination, they were surely cornering the fleeing people.
It was as if everything was calculated, such was their movement.
The townspeople cornered against the wall are exchanging words with the attackers.
The attackers exchange glances and nod, then point the muzzle of their guns at the townspeople's heads.
And without the slightest hesitation, they pull the finger they had on the trigger.
With a dry sound, their heads shook violently as if exploding, and the townspeople collapsed on the spot...
The sound snapped me back to reality, and I understood the situation.
It's hard to believe, but... this town seems to be under attack.
What Shiona said was true...
I rushed back to the lobby in a hurry.
Seeing me like that, Tippy asked anxiously.
"Ray... what happened? You have a really scared look on your face."
"...I don't really know... but... something bad is happening..."
Unable to tell Tippy directly what I had seen, I spoke vaguely.
"Something bad? What do you mean?"
"I think this town is being attacked..."
"No... Tippy's scared..."
"It's okay, it's far away in the town. It should still be safe here, so calm down."
"...Okay... but, what are we going to do?"
"I'm going to go check and see what's happening."
I was worried about the town, but I was even more worried about Shiona.
Even though that thing happened yesterday, she's still a person who helped me.
I haven't even asked why Shiona, who is kind to everyone, is so harsh only to Tippy.
I still don't understand the meaning of her words that it was for my sake.
"No, don't go... please... Ray..."
"It's okay, Tippy. I'll definitely come back."
"Really? Really, really?"
"Yeah, of course. So, can you wait for me a little bit?"
"If you come back, Tippy will wait."
Tippy hugged her bear tightly.
Even so, the anxiety couldn't be erased from her expression.
Is there nothing I can do for this girl's sadness and anxiety?
Leaving the library with such guilty feelings in my heart, I left the library.
I decided to use back streets as much as possible on the way to town.
What's happening in town is clearly not good.
There is a risk that I might suffer some damage if I am found.
I head to the square, trying to keep my footsteps as quiet as possible.
I wanted to arrive before the squad if possible, but it seems impossible because I took a detour repeatedly.
The closer I get to the center of town, the more broken buildings I notice.
But those are all buildings that didn't seem like they would break until yesterday.
Were they destroyed by those strangers who were chasing the townspeople?
Dust is drifting in the town that was beautiful until yesterday.
Why would they need to destroy the buildings in this peaceful town?
I just can't understand it.
Amidst the screams and the noise of buildings being destroyed, I arrived at the truth.
--The tragedy unfolding in the square.
Many men were chasing and capturing the townspeople.
Pointing guns and using unreasonable violence as a shield, they drove men, women, and even children indiscriminately.
The captured townspeople are being made to sit in the center of the square.
Children crying. Inarticulate shouts of anger.
The armed men, not caring about those voices, have cool faces.
No, maybe the expression "cool faces" is strange.
They had faces that showed no interest, like glancing at a stone lying on the roadside.
I can't see Shiona anywhere within my sight. I guess I can assume she hasn't been captured yet...?
"--What's the situation?"
"--We've captured the majority of the residents. It's only a matter of time for the rest."
I overheard two men talking nearby.
Making sure they don't notice me, I slowly approached the two and eavesdropped.
"What about water and food?"
"There were sufficient reserves. We even found an underground water source for water."
"I see, so it's been more fruitful than expected."
"Yes, it's possible to settle here permanently."
I was certain.
These men are the ones raiding the town and stealing water and food.
I just couldn't forgive their senselessness.
To hurt innocent people for the sake of mere plunder.
But I couldn't do anything more than that.
I can't even jump out of there.
I knew better than anyone that I was powerless.
"But how did you find such a small town?"
"--There was that slave who escaped the other day, right?"
"If I remember correctly, he was advocating for coexistence with the Phloids..."
"Yes. A foolish man trapped in old-fashioned ideas. Coexistence and harmony with the Phloids are such useless thoughts in this world."
--Coexistence and harmony...
Those words bring to mind a certain young man.
The one I helped, brought to this town... and those were his last words before he passed.
Does that mean these humans are the ones who inflicted those injuries on him?
"So, we treated him the same as the Phloids, as a labor force we kept alive."
"That's right. We chased after him to bring him back, and it unexpectedly came in handy."
One of the men continued in a monotonous voice.
"After all, a human appeared to help that man and guided us to the town."
Hearing those words, I felt a chill run down my spine.
Why didn't I consider the cause of that young man's injuries back then?
I should have known from Shiona that there was a group carrying out raids...
Even when returning to town, if I had paid more attention to my surroundings, I might have avoided being followed.
I regret taking such rash actions on a momentary impulse.
I'm the one who created the cause of this raid.
"We have finished gathering the town's main figures in one place. There are zero rebels."
"I see. Then, select from among them those who can be administered an oral drug and who lack production or management skills. Factors that reduce productivity are--"
As he said that, the man receiving the report pulled a handgun from his pocket.
"Dispose of them."
"--Stop!"
At the same moment I understood the meaning of those words, I shouted.
However, I couldn't help but shout at these humans who so casually said 'dispose' of the townspeople who had taken care of me.
With that, the men who were there turned around.
And our eyes met.
"Secure him."
With that voice, the men rushed towards me.
In a panic, I started running.
But my body isn't keeping up with my feelings.
My feet aren't moving well, and I've ended up running away while losing my balance.
The men are quickly closing in behind me.
Their movements are precise, like machines.
Damn, at this rate, I'll be caught.
It's now or never, I escaped into the alleyway.
The alleyway has many muddy spots due to the rain.
While my feet are getting caught, I continue to run through.
Occasionally, I knock over lumber leaning against the wall, trying to slow the men down.
But that's not enough to stop them.
I could tell the men were right behind me.
Can I escape like this...?
The place I was aiming for was the library.
Even if I could escape to the library, Tippy's existence would be exposed to them.
If Tippy were to be attacked--.
I changed the direction of my toes.
I escaped into what seemed to be the back door of the nearest building.
Coincidentally, it was Mad's general store.
I was looking for a place to hide--.
"! ?"
I found a figure sitting in a chair.
Mad doesn't answer. Just like that day after turning the projector, he sat shallowly in the chair with his arms crossed.
"Mad, you can hear me, right!? Please stop joking at a time like this, Mad-- Mad?"
I barely swallowed my scream.
The moment I touched Mad's shoulder, Mad--quietly collapsed from the chair. As if he were already dead.
Wh-Why--!
Did those men 'dispose' of him? But, there aren't any external wounds.
"Target acquired."
Ironically, it was the voices of the men who had been chasing me that brought me back to my senses as I was about to panic.
However, it was far too late.
"The workforce we have now is sufficient; eliminate."
Unable to do anything, I just frantically jumped back from Mad, the men stepped in, and the man in the lead aimed a gun at me──
"Ray!"
Immediately after, several things happened at once.
With a dry sound, a gunshot rang out.
And, a figure slid in front of me as if to protect me--.
"Sio--"
It took me a moment to grasp the situation.
That person was standing there, as if protecting me.
That person turned only their face to look at me.
With the same unchanging smile, that person looked at me.
And, a few seconds later--.
"Shionaaaaaa!"
With my mind blank, I scream.
Seeing her like that, my body began to move unconsciously.
With the mechanical arm hidden beneath my glove, I punched down one of the shelves. It triggered a chain reaction, toppling all the shelves in the store--scattering fine fragments and even finer dust everywhere.
At the same time, I picked up a can that had fallen on the floor and threw it with all my might towards the window.
The men react to the sound of the window glass shattering.
"Did they escape through the window?"
"Chase them!"
The men jump out through the still-open door.
"Did they go...?"
As for me, I was crouching still right next to the fallen shelf, half of my body sunk into the floor that had been knocked out by the impact.
Hugging Shiona in my arms so that the shelves and fragments wouldn't hit her.
"Shiona, Shiona, stay with me!"
I desperately shake Shiona, whose eyes are closed.
It seems she's fainted.
I run my eyes over Shiona's body, but I can't find any wounds.
Could the bullet have missed? But, since she's unconscious, I can't say she's unharmed.
In any case, I have to evacuate immediately.
--The only place nearby where I can do that is...
I take a deep breath and remember.
The girl I left waiting at the library.
I took the back streets to return to the library, trying not to be seen by the humans.
Carrying Shiona on my back was a considerable handicap, but I made my way through the ruined buildings over and over.
During that time, Shiona didn't move at all. That helped in terms of carrying her, but at the same time, it increased my anxiety.
If something happened to Shiona--while being crushed by that fear, I arrived at the library.
The clouds covering the sky were darkening even further.
Having finally reached the library, I began searching for Tippy.
I wonder if Tippy is safe?
For now, there are no signs of the library having been ransacked.
There's no sign that anyone has entered.
After passing through the entrance, the interior of the library was silent.
Feeling relieved, I weaved between the shelves, searching for Tippy.
But no matter how much I searched, I couldn't find Tippy.
Could it be--.
Trying to shake off the unpleasant thought, I desperately searched the area.
Could it be--.
Relying on hope, I headed to the lobby.
I went around to the back of it.
There, I found Tippy, covering her ears and eyes, trembling slightly.
I reached out my hand to that small body.
"Tippy, I'm back."
Tippy's shoulders were jumping slightly.
But when she recognized me, she hugged me with the force of a pounce.
"Welcome back. I believed in you, Rei."
She pressed large tears against my chest.
Her body was trembling slightly.
Ah, I had made this child anxious again.
I put my hand on her back and stroked it.
"It's okay... I'll never leave you again."
Perhaps relieved by those words, Tippy's trembling lessened and eventually stopped.
"What happened? Shiona, what's wrong?"
Tippy looked at Shiona, who still had her eyes closed, and asked anxiously.
I told her the truth without hiding anything.
"She was shot. To protect me... She doesn't seem to be injured, but she's unconscious..."
"Show me right away!"
With unprecedented agility, Tippy scooped up Shiona and laid her on the floor.
"Rei, turn around, I'm going to look at Shiona's wounds."
"Ah, okay... W-Wait, is Shiona injured!?"
"I don't know. But I'm going to check."
Seeing Tippy's hands on Shiona's clothes, I turned around in a hurry.
Before long--
"...I'm okay, there were no problems... Rei."
Tippy's tone had returned to normal.
I quietly turned around.
Shiona was breathing peacefully on the lobby floor where she lay.
I thought she had been shot protecting me, but it seems she just lost consciousness from the close-range gunshot.
"I'm glad..."
I sighed with heartfelt relief.
"Rei, why was Shiona shot?"
"Humans came. And they're starting to loot this town. Destroying buildings--"
I didn't mention that they were trying to 'dispose' of the townspeople, or that Mad-san might have already been 'taken care of'.
"And when I was found and about to be shot, Shiona protected me--"
I clenched my fist tightly without thinking. Tippy looked at me sadly,
"--I see. But if that's the case... this place might be dangerous too."
She answered with a serious face.
"I wonder if we can get through this by hiding... Somehow until the humans leave..."
As if to stop my words, Tippy sadly shook her head.
"The humans have found this town. A town for them to live in. So, they'll come here too."
"No way... Are they going to settle down here...?"
"Because this is a 'town'."
A town... That's right.
I walked through barren lands before I reached this place too.
I had no food or water, and was constantly facing death.
Those humans must have traveled through such a world too.
If that's the case, this "town" is a paradise they could only dream of.
"But... even so, why do they have to steal? The people of this town would have accepted them."
"It's for them to live."
"It's wrong to think that anything is okay for that... that it's okay to sacrifice someone!"
"...Rei, scary..."
"Ah, sorry, I didn't mean to scare you, Tippy..."
I unclenched my fist, which I had clenched in anger, and stroked Tippy's head to reassure her.
Let's think about Tippy and Shiona for now.
If we stay in town like this, these two will be in danger too.
I really want to help everyone in town. But I can't right now. I don't have the power or wisdom.
I'll freeze the emotions that Shiona and the townspeople taught me, and mechanically... make the most efficient choice.
Let's go somewhere safe first.
"Tippy, let's leave town for now. And let's think about how to help the townspeople."
As I said that, my chest tightened.
It's because I put a rank on lives.
I chose the lives in front of me, within reach.
It must be a shameful thing to do. All lives are equal in weight... but even so, I'm trying to choose...
"Yeah, I think that's a good idea."
The little girl's nod lightens my guilt.
"Let's hide in that abandoned factory for now. There shouldn't be anything there that the humans would want."
"Then, I have to prepare food for Rei and Shiona..."
"That's right. I wish we could somehow stop by the church."
The library and the church where we are now are on opposite sides of the square, at opposite ends of town.
Even if we leave town and make a big detour, we won't last long if we're targeted in an open area. Besides, I'll be carrying Shiona on my back.
So, does that mean we have to go through the rubble again? It'll be even more difficult this time since Tippy's with us...
I explained that to Tippy as clearly as possible.
"Is it hard to go to the church?"
"Yeah... for now."
"Then, we should go under!"
"...Under?"
"Yeah, under. Go under the ground and go to the church."
"Yeah, underground. If it's underground, no one will find us."
"Underground... underground, huh... but how?"
"You can go inside through a manhole and go under the town."
...I see.
Certainly, if we did that, we could get to the church without being seen by anyone.
"That's a great idea, Tippy! You're amazing, Tippy!"
"Ehehe... Rei praised me."
"But, where are the manholes located in town?"
"Hmm... Rei, come here."
Tippy takes my hand and leads me to the bookshelf.
Without the slightest hesitation, she came to a certain bookshelf.
"That book."
I take the book Tippy is pointing at and open it.
Inside was a map of the town's manhole locations and its underground waterways.
"You're amazing, Tippy! With this, we can get to the church without any problems."
"Thank you... Rei."
Tippy narrows her eyes and rejoices as I stroke her head.
"Alright, Tippy. Let's get going right away."
"Okay... but wait. I'll get ready, so just a little bit... wait?"
"Yeah, sure."
"Thank you, Rei."
Tippy bows quickly and disappears into the back room.
Tippy said she was fine, but I'm still worried that she hasn't regained consciousness.
Perhaps what the humans shot wasn't a bullet-firing gun, but a weapon that robs one of their freedom.
If I know the cause, I'll know how to deal with it.
Is this how terrifying an unknown situation can be?
"Sorry to keep you waiting, Rei. What's wrong?"
Tippy came back from the back room.
"No, it's nothing. I was just a little worried about Shiona."
I answered, trying to appear as calm as possible.
"So, what are you taking with you?"
Tippy, who said she had prepared, was carrying a large bag.
"A stuffed animal and... a picture book and... crayons."
"I see. They're important to you, huh?"
"And... pictures of Papa and Mama."
Tippy says sadly.
Pictures of her parents, who will probably never return.
I can't understand how Tippy feels as she stares at the pictures.
"Um, then what's this?"
Apart from the large bag, Tippy was carrying a thin but sturdy metal case. It seemed a little too rugged for the petite Tippy to carry.
"This is... I'll tell you later. More importantly, Rei, let's go."
"Ah, okay..."
With Tippy's help, I carry Shiona, who is lying on the floor, on my back. Strangely, I couldn't feel her weight.
"I'm ready, Tippy."
"Okay, then... goodbye."
Tippy said goodbye to the countless bookshelves.
Her voice sounded somewhat sad.
I still haven't been able to heal this girl's sadness at all.
But I haven't given up.
We'll be together from now on.
Even if it's just little by little, as we spend time together...
I want to heal Tippy's sadness.
And someday, I want to see a heartfelt smile on Tippy's face.
That was my secret wish right now.
"Alright, let's go."
"--Okay."
Even without uttering a single complaint, Tippy followed me.
By the time we reached the church, we were quite exhausted.
There were no signs of humans around.
We carefully looked around and stepped into the church.
The chapel was silent.
It was a silence that made the town's commotion seem like a lie.
I found a music box on the altar at the back of the chapel.
Was this where Shiona listened to its melody?
The sound of my footsteps as I walked towards the music box echoed loudly in the chapel.
I approached the altar and reached for the music box.
As I turned the handle, a melody poured out from within.
The melody warmed the depths of my heart somehow.
--Suddenly, I heard a singing voice.
It came from behind me.
"Welcome back,"
Shiona said, getting off my back.
"That's not important. Are you hurt anywhere? Tippy said you were okay, but..."
"Yeah, I seem to be fine."
Shiona smiled to reassure me. Then, she looked at Tippy, who was next to her.
"Tippy-chan... you came too, huh?"
"Yeah--"
As always, with a sad look--yet with a face that seemed resolved, Tippy nodded.
"Shiona..."
Tippy held her palm towards Shiona, stopping her words.
"I understand... I understand, but!"
Shiona looked down, as if enduring something.
"--Shiona."
In response, Tippy was gentle as ever...
It was such an unexpected statement. Shiona gasped and stared into Tippy's small eyes.
"While I was with Rei, I realized it. What Shiona is trying to do."
"But, if that's the case--"
"That's also why I came here. The library is impossible now... Probably, this town too."
"Tippy-chan, I'm sorry..."
"It's okay. Shiona doesn't need to cry."
Tippy gently hugged Shiona, who knelt down and jumped into her arms, as she said that.
It was as if Tippy was the older sister, giving one such an illusion.
"Rei, what are you going to do now?"
Tippy's words startled me back to reality.
"If Shiona seems okay, I want to help the people of the town. Especially those who were said to be disposed of--"
"Disposed of?"
"Yeah..."
It was a terrible way of putting it... A way of speaking that didn't see fellow humans as humans.
"Can Rei do it?"
"I don't know, but--even so, I can't just stand by and watch someone about to be killed before my eyes."
"But, Rei will be in danger."
"Yeah, I know that, but..."
They're the kind of guys who would point a gun at you without a second thought. There's nothing I can do by confronting them head-on.
Surely, even having a discussion would be impossible.
"I promise. If it gets even a little dangerous, I'll definitely turn back."
"Absolutely. If Rei gets hurt--everything will be irreversible."
Yeah. I can't just leave Shiona behind either.
Rei...
Shiona--
With that one word, we separated as if magnets repelled each other.
S-Sorry! It's not like I forgot about Tippy-chan!
Only Shiona, that's not fair...
Tippy said, pouting slightly.
I'm sorry, Tippy. I didn't mean it that way...
I apologized while gently stroking Tippy's head.
Muu... That's not what I meant...
Even so, Tippy's expression wasn't entirely displeased.
Shiona laughed at that sight--followed by me and Tippy also smiling.
And so, we laughed together.
Without anyone saying it, the three of us held hands.
Grasping each other's hands tightly, as if never to let go again.
And before that resolve could waver, I declared.
From now on, let's always be together, the three of us. Always--
But, as if mocking me...
In the distance, footsteps echoed.
Shiona's smile, Tippy's smile, stiffened.
I'm sure I'm stiffening up too.
Everyone in town has been captured.
Then, the one heading towards this church now is--
Without a doubt, it's a human.
I was the first to move. I looked out the window, careful not to make a sound.
There's one figure. However, I don't know how many more are coming behind.
Shiona, Tippy, head to the back of the chapel. Crouch down as much as possible, so you can't be seen from outside.
Okay, but shouldn't we lock the door first?
No. If we do that, they'll definitely call for backup. If that happens, we won't stand a chance.
I want to neutralize the human outside without making any noise if possible.
If it's just one person, I think I can manage. If there are two, we can somehow manage with a surprise attack.
But, if there are three or more--I haven't told Shiona or Tippy, but I was prepared to be captured alone.
Concealing my footsteps, I stood in the shadow of the door. In the meantime, the footsteps are getting closer and closer.
The number is one. For now, there's no one following behind.
...Haaah...
I quietly took a deep breath and steeled myself.
Holding my breath. The footsteps are--right next to me.
The door slowly opened.
Following that, a man with a gun slowly entered.
--Now!
In that instant, I swung my arm down with all my might from his blind spot.
Immediately, I kicked away the gun that fell to the floor.
At the same time, I tried to sweep his legs, but as expected, he dodged it.
We're still close enough to be almost touching.
It's safe to assume he has weapons other than a gun.
If so, I can catch him off guard by pouncing on him the moment he reaches for one.
But the man quietly tilted his head and looked at me.
What do you think you're doing?
He asked in a monotone voice.
Why are you hostile to us? Are you the owner of this town?
Owner? I just want to do what's best for the people of this town.
That's quite the Philoid-like thing to say.
...So what if it is...? That's my reason for existing.
As I said that, I took off the glove on my right hand and showed him my mechanical hand.
It's not a good idea to fight me, with my mechanical body, head-on.
If I can make him think that, maybe he'll back off.
Right now, all that matters is ensuring Shiona and Tippy's safety. Even if they find out what I really am, I'll protect what I want to protect.
That's my role as a Philoid.
The man tilted his head again at my actions.
What are you talking about? Philoids can't take any combat actions. They're made to obey orders, so they can't go against humans.
Huh?
In any case, you're a misfit trapped in old-fashioned ideas. I'll eliminate you before you become a problem.
The blade is thrust straight at my throat.
I grabbed the knife blade with my mechanical right hand. Then, I put all my strength into it and twisted it sharply.
With just that, the knife blade snapped off at the base.
I put all my weight on him and pushed him down. I put the elbow of my left arm on his throat and pinned his legs with my knees--
Ray!
Shiona came rushing out from the back of the room.
I held down the man's throat with my left hand, and while raising my bare metal right hand, I said:
It's a metal arm that can break a knife. If I swing it down on his head with all my might, he won't come out of it unscathed.
Ray, stop!
Shiona pleaded in a trembling voice.
--But.
While grinding my teeth, I put all my strength into it--and swung my right hand down.
My right hand was half-buried.
Not in the man's head, but in the floor right next to it.
Why spare me? If you consider your own safety, killing me is the right choice.
The man said that, still without any expression.
That's not true. Killing is the wrong choice, no matter the reason.
Incorrigible. Such inefficient thinking.
I'll take you hostage. And make them release the townspeople.
I grab the man by the collar and pull him up.
That's meaningless. My life isn't worth that much. If my death now opens the way for my comrades' future, I have no reason to regret it.
Without changing his tone at all, the man took something out of his pocket.
It was an old-fashioned bomb. He pulled out the safety pin and grabbed my arm at the same time.
What!
I instinctively pull my arm back, but it doesn't budge.
I shudder.
How can this human not show any emotion on his face, even at this moment when he is about to throw away his life?
The color of his eyes, devoid of any will, seemed to bind my body.
--No! If I let my thoughts stop, it's over!
I instantly switch gears and start analyzing the situation.
What the man is holding is a really small bomb, about the size of a small fruit.
But, since it's a bomb, it will have lethal force, and more than anything, the blast could alert the humans staying in the town.
When, when will it explode?
The other party intends to blow himself up. It's certain that there isn't much time.
But, what should I do? If the scale of the explosion is large, Shiona and the others who are hiding will also be affected.
It's impossible to neutralize this bomb, so what's the best way to minimize its effect?
I reflexively hug the man. In a way that sandwiches the bomb.
This way, I might at least be able to protect Shiona and the others from the blast. It might be imperfect, but it's the best choice I can think of.
If only I can save at least these two──
The next moment, the impact came.
From the side. Like being shoved away... no, different, I WAS shoved away!
While rolling on the floor, I look at the place I was just in.
There, holding the bomb, was Shiona.
Shiona!
Get down!
The bomb she was clutching burst with a strong light and sound.
Perhaps the scale of the explosion wasn't that large because it was a type of bomb not intended to kill.
Even so, I, who was at point-blank range, took the blast and sound head-on and was dizzy.
The human who was also at point-blank range has also lost consciousness.
Shiona!
In my swaying vision, I shouted.
Please, please be safe.
Shiona!?
...Rei...
Shio...na...
Shiona, we need to treat you immediately!
The distance of a few steps felt incredibly long.
While slapping my faltering legs, I approached Shiona.
And that's when I saw it.
What... is this...
I was speechless at the sight of Shiona.
Her right arm, thrown on the floor... from the wrist onward... a metallic frame?
Not bone. Absolutely not. It's clearly different from that of a human.
And--it's gone.
That's strange.
Something that should be there, isn't.
Red.
That is the proof of a human.
Wh-wh-why?
B-but...
I clench my mechanical right hand covered with a glove.
Yes, if we were the same... if only we were the same...
Shiona, are you... okay?
Yeah, I'm fine with this much.
There's no way that's true.
There's no way that could be true.
She took the explosion head-on at such close range.
There's no way she could be okay.
It must be so painful that she can't help but shed tears.
And yet.
And yet, why?
"Rather than me... Rei, your head."
I followed Shiona's gaze and touched my head.
--Ah, why is this?
Why is it that something Shiona needs is with me?
I don't want this.
I don't need this, so I wish Shiona had it.
No, she should have had it.
Shiona touches my head and says.
"You're bleeding, are you okay?"
Blood was flowing from my head.
Red.
Red blood.
Something that doesn't flow through a Philoid...
In contrast, not even a drop of blood flowed from Shiona's arm.
Instead, the exposed mechanical parts are visible.
What this means is only one thing.
That is--
"...Rei? There was a loud noise, are you okay--Shiona!? Rei!?"
Tipi, who came out from the back, screamed.
Her expression was uneasy, and her eyes were filled with tears.
"You both have to heal your injuries...!"
"It's okay... I'm okay..."
I gently embraced Tipi, who was on the verge of panicking.
Embraced, Tipi's face showed a slight expression of relief in my chest.
But it was unstable.
It looked like it was about to collapse at any moment, and it made my chest ache.
"Rei... let's move, we can't stay here anymore..."
Tipi said in a trembling voice. Shiona nodded in agreement.
Certainly, with the explosion just now, other Ningens will definitely come.
There were many things I wanted to ask.
There were many things I wanted to confirm.
But, I swallow it all for now.
"...Let's go, let's leave the town."
We left the church with only the bare minimum of luggage.
Then, following Tipi's instructions, we used the back streets of the town to escape to the outside, and headed for the abandoned factory.
I was reminded there too...
The only one whose steps were heavy with fatigue... was me.
Led by Tipi and pulled by Shiona, we continue walking.
Reaching the abandoned factory, I finally lowered myself to the ground.
Next to Shiona, who had a cool face, I tried to catch my ragged breath.
"Tipi, I'll go fetch some water."
The little girl glanced at Shiona and then disappeared into the depths of the abandoned factory.
She probably entrusted all the explanations to Shiona.
"...Shiona."
Shiona returns a slightly troubled smile to my voice.
"I think you've already noticed, but I am... no. Everyone living in this town is a Philoid."
That was... what I was trying to avoid facing.
I had a premonition... I felt something was off... but it was something I didn't want to admit...
"So... I'm a 'Ningen'?"
When my head was damaged, a red liquid leaked from the damaged area.
It closely resembled the 'blood' that flows inside a Ningen.
Philoids don't have such liquid installed, so it shouldn't flow.
"You've been misunderstanding because you have a mechanical arm... that's a medical artificial part to compensate for a limb you lost in an accident or something."
"No way... so I really am..."
"Yes, you are a Ningen. The parent and partner who created us Philoids. That's who you are. Everyone in town is a Philoid. Only you were a Ningen."
"I see..."
I stare at my mechanical right hand covered in a glove and weakly clench it.
The existence I thought I was is the complete opposite....
Shiona is a Philoid... and I am a Ningen...
--In other words, I am a Ningen, the very existence I should hate.
I felt something deep within my chest.
That feeling was painful.
Sad.
And infuriating.
I was the same as those cold, merciless beings I could only see as evil.
My chest ached unbearably.
I felt anger at this unchangeable truth.
What the man I was dealing with earlier said was right.
I wasn't a Philoid, but a Ningen.
And those Ningen, the rulers, were going to do terrible things to the Philoid townspeople, the ruled--no, they probably already are.
How did things end up like this?
I just wanted to live together with Shiona and the townspeople.
I just wanted to make everyone happy.
But, but, but--.
I can't do that.
Because I'm a Ningen.
Because I'm one of those hopeless creatures.
I felt warmth in the fist I had unconsciously clenched.
When I lowered my gaze, I saw Shiona's hand placed over mine.
That temperature is artificial.
But, it didn't matter to me.
...Warm.
Just that alone made the emotions weighing on my heart fade away.
But at the same time, it highlighted my own inadequacy.
Do I even deserve her kindness?
"Do you want to know more? About you guys?"
Shiona said, turning a smile towards me.
"By 'you guys,' do you mean Ningen?"
"Yes, Ningen. Do you want to know about our partners?"
If I can learn about it, I want to know.
So I nodded.
"I want to know... I want to know why we ended up like this."
"Lei, do you remember the picture of Tippy-chan that was in the library?"
"Ah, I remember..."
"That picture, Tippy-chan draws it every day. Every single day, no matter what, one picture a day."
I closed my eyelids and recalled that scene.
Those pictures drawn with crayons, there were dozens, hundreds of them.
"How many do you think there are?"
"I don't know... If Tippy is also a Filoid, she's probably been drawing them for years... Maybe around a thousand."
"Eighty-six thousand six hundred and seventy-one."
"Eighty-six thou--"
Once again, a strong dizziness attacked me. But it wasn't from the earlier explosion, or the subsequent bleeding.
Tippy spent such a long time all alone in that dark library?
There couldn't have been many people who came to that library.
It must have been a lonely existence.
Just thinking about the time Tippy spent there, I felt a terror as if I was losing my footing.
And Tippy endured it.
With that small body.
"From there, several decades before that, we Filoids were born. Desired by the Ningen--"
Shiona told me the history of the Filoids as if singing a song.
First, Filoids were androids that had reached the practical stage, equipped with Ningen emotions.
Basic emotional information was installed from the beginning, and a system was adopted that allowed them to learn new emotions through an independent thinking circuit.
Including that, it can be said that they are as close to Ningen as possible.
Therefore, they were able to become as close to Ningen as possible, not only in work but also in life.
Eventually, companies appeared that installed custom-made emotions and memories, and an unprecedented Filoid boom arrived.
Families who could not have children purchased Filoid children, and those who lost parents or children ordered Filoids with those memories, ushering in such an era.
In the blink of an eye, the number of Filoids increased, and in just over a decade, the number produced was comparable to the Ningen population.
Among them, the most groundbreaking was the Filoid equipped with 'love,' the most complex emotion of the Ningen.
It had the ability to serve as a companion for life.
You could obtain a loved one without going through the process of romance, and that love was guaranteed semi-permanently.
In a society where late marriages were becoming more common and more Ningen were prioritizing work over romance, the demand was great and it was received with applause.
However, children were not born into families who married Filoids, which accelerated the declining birthrate.
And the declining birthrate created a shortage of marriage partners, creating a loop in which more and more people married Filoids.
"And before they knew it, the Ningen had forgotten how to nurture love."
Shiona smiled sadly.
"Ningen children began to be created artificially using science. But the Ningen, who had lost love, could not teach love to the children who were born."
Love was the origin of all emotions.
Because there is love, you feel the joy of connecting with someone.
Because there is love, you know what you want to protect and feel anger when it is hurt.
Because there is love, you feel sadness when you lose something precious.
Because there is love... you share, divide, and enjoy the same emotions.
But... they forgot it.
The Ningen who came to town are probably those kinds of "Ningen."
The Ningen, who forgot "emotion" along with love, even lost the ability to care for others.
The Ningen no longer needed love, and the existence of Filoids with emotions became unwelcome.
When they thought about streamlining their actions, they felt there was too much waste...
The Ningen eventually came to believe that Filoids should be machines.
Daring to go to harsh environments... performing dangerous tasks... abuse exceeding specifications...
But there were also Ningen who didn't approve of that.
The Ningen who retained the emotion of love appealed: Filoids are partners.
The world was divided in two.
Ningen with love, and Ningen without.
And the Ningen without love concluded.
That the old-fashioned way of thinking was foolish, that it should be annihilated...
They didn't even hesitate to press the button for a weapon that would scorch the earth.
After that, everything happened quickly.
It didn't even take five days for retaliation to call for retaliation, and for the world to be engulfed in flames and ash.
Contaminated, poisonous earth, black clouds blocking the sunlight, a sea that cannot nourish life.
The history of the Ningen would come to an end by their own hands...
It was such a foolish choice.
"We, who were born for the sake of the Ningen, ended up taking away what was most important to the Ningen."
"That's not true... the ones at fault are us Ningen, in every way..."
"But you know, there were many Ningen who survived. No matter how tattered the world becomes, life doesn't stop moving forward."
I can't find the words to respond to Shiona, who speaks to me so gently.
"...Ahem, ah, aah, aah."
Suddenly, Shiona started vocal exercises.
And then, she turned to face my puzzled self head-on──
"Nice to meet you. I am MODA-117 Alice mk-17, manufactured by Asou International. Have you registered as a user yet? If you have registered, please decide on my individual name. It's the first name given to me. Please choose carefully!"
I was caught off guard.
It would be easy to say I'd never seen that before... but it was the first time I'd seen Shiona so utterly cheerful and innocent.
"Surprised?"
Shiona asked, back to her usual self.
"Y-yeah..."
"That's the oldest memory I have."
I wonder when that was. I can't even imagine.
"Back then, every day was like a festival... it was so lively."
Saying that, Shiona showed me a piece of paper that looked like a newspaper clipping.
"World-renowned Musician Passes Away"
The photo in it was the same one in the photo frame in Shiona's room.
He had a face similar to mine.
"This is... your older brother?"
"Yes, this story is also quite old... You see, I'm the latest model among the Filoids that were manufactured. Fifth generation, I think."
I wonder how Shiona feels about describing herself as 'manufactured.'
Filoids have emotions just like Ningen.
In other words, they are the same as Ningen.
Can she really accept it so easily?
"My generation was the first model to be equipped with the concept of human 'death.' To get as close to Ningen as possible. But the models before me don't have that... That's the case with Mad-san and Tippy-chan. Neither of them can understand 'death.' It's useless to explain it. The day they understand will never come."
To keep waiting without knowing death.
It's a hope that exists, but a hope that will never be rewarded.
Despair in the name of hope.
To be confronted with that unconditionally.
If I'm going to be confronted with something like that, wouldn't it be better to have been taught despair from the start?
I thought it would be better that way.
"Tippy-chan is an even earlier model... I think she was a second-generation Filoid. Up to the second generation, they can't extract energy from food. That's why she runs on electricity. But there's a limit to how long the battery lasts. She carries that bear plush as an auxiliary battery."
Now that I think about it, Tippy always had that stuffed animal in her hands whenever she moved somewhere.
I had no idea it was a battery.
But that explains something.
The reason Tippy was always in that library.
That library has the only power generation system in town.
Tippy stayed in that place to continue her activities.
"Tippy-chan's parents also died a long time ago. Probably more than 200 years ago. But Tippy-chan, who has no concept of death, is waiting. Always, all alone."
What a cruel story.
I don't know the lifespan of a Filoid, but Tippy has spent hundreds of years like that.
Every day, shedding tears.
Trapped in a future that will never come... Held captive by an unfulfilled hope.
In that library, all alone.
It feels like there's a lead ball in the depths of my chest.
It's painful and agonizing.
But the more I think about it, the more it sinks into the depths of me.
"But, it's still painful even knowing that."
And Shiona is aware of death. In other words, she can't even hold onto the hope that she might see them again.
"Ray, you saw Mad collapse at the general store, right?"
"Yeah... It was strange. It was as if only his soul had left, even though he had no external injuries--"
I understand now. Mad was already broken at that time.
"But, we have to keep living like this. Until the day of our death--when we break. For us who don't get sick, that's a time equal to eternity. That's why we try to be human. Wouldn't it be too sad otherwise? We take over the work that our partners were doing, or we do the work of positions that have disappeared... Just like humans did, we keep the world turning. So that this world that humans were turning never stops."
Mad ran the general store.
There were various shops in town, like a photo shop and a bar.
All of that was the work of the Filoids.
It was the effort of the Filoids to protect the human world.
It was the last hope of the Filoids who were left behind.
"We spend every day so that when humans return someday, we can tell them about that fun time, so that we can return it."
Shiona showed a smile.
An emotion that is completely out of place in the current situation.
With that smile, Shiona was protecting herself.
That smile looked sad to me.
"...But, we Filoids also have a defect. That is, if something unbearably painful happens, only some kind of emotion comes to the fore. I'm like this, Mad is always angry, and Tippy-chan is always sad."
But, Shiona continued.
"It's our last fortress. If even that emotion disappears, we'll break... we'll die."
"Then, when Shiona was shot, Mad was--"
"That's right. He didn't just go on a trip. After Ray finished showing him that movie, Mad stopped mov--no, he stopped moving."
"Then, you closed the shop--Shiona?"
"Yeah. I thought Ray would be suspicious if I didn't, not to mention the townspeople. And you were, weren't you?"
"Well, yeah, but..."
If the shop had remained open there, I definitely would have gone inside and found Mad unmoving.
If the humans hadn't come, I probably never would have noticed.
In the end, it was confirmed that I wasn't just seeing things.
I didn't want to believe it, but it was the truth.
"My brother used to say, 'Emotions are pieces of the puzzle of life.' Emotions are the pieces that connect life. If an emotion is missing, all the pieces will crumble. That's the same for both humans and Filoids. Mad broke because the emotion of anger towards his son dissipated."
If that's the case, then I killed Mad.
I found the playback device on my own and made Mad watch his son's movie without permission.
If I hadn't done that, Mad wouldn't have broken and would still be moving now.
As if sensing my feelings, Shiona moved to my left and placed her hand on mine.
"It's okay, it's not your fault, Ray. Sooner or later, we're all destined to end up like that. Just like humans can't escape death. Mad was surely happy. He was able to know his son's true feelings in the end."
"Maybe. But--"
An unbearable feeling swells up.
If I had known that back then--I would have stopped him, even by force.
"You're so kind, Ray--"
"That's not true..."
Shiona stood next to me.
I couldn't see Shiona's expression.
Anxiety pounded against my chest from the inside.
"Because even knowing, I still wish for it. I wonder if I'll ever see that smile again."
Shiona smiled sadly as she looked at her brother's picture.
"That's why, when I first met Ray, I was so happy. Ah, it was all a dream after all, I thought. My brother was alive."
Dying.
Whether you know it or not, it's painful.
Made to be convenient for humans, forced to have a family, and then left with only the pain of death.
Selfish and the worst.
That's us, humans.
"Tipi-chan is feeling the loneliness of losing her family. That's why, if she acts like family, she'll 'die.' But that doesn't mean I don't want you to say those words, Ray. We Filoids have a rule that we can't do or say anything that 'makes them realize we're Filoids.' Because it would shatter the humans' dreams. But I went too far... I'm sorry."
When Shiona lowered her head, a sweet scent wafted around me.
Certainly, what Shiona did wasn't something that could be forgiven.
But, considering Shiona's feelings, it was clear that that method was the most reasonable.
"It can't be helped. Shiona was just following the rules, it's not your fault."
Forgiving someone like this, and being forgiven by someone.
Apologizing, and being apologized to.
Crying, getting angry, and laughing.
That's what humans are.
They, the Filoids, knew that better than anyone.
"Thank you for telling me, Shiona. For being so kind to me, a human..."
I felt ashamed as a human.
To think that I was repaying the kindness of these Filoids who were doing so much for me with evil.
Even as we speak, humans in the town might be 'disposing' of Filoids.
And the Filoids probably can't offer much resistance to it.
Thinking that, I couldn't hide the pain in the depths of my heart.
Shiona gently reached out and embraced me.
A warm warmth enveloped me.
"Of course. Humans and Filoids are partners, both in the past and now. It's decided that it will be that way far into the future."
I felt like the emotion I couldn't understand until the very end was there.
It was warm, vast, deep, strong, gentle, soft, large, and precious.
Humans had lost something great.
But they remembered what the humans had forgotten.
For many years, many decades, many centuries.
Even while enduring loneliness, they continued to protect it.
I felt like I had to inherit it and protect it in the same way.
It's not a duty or an order.
It was something I myself desired.
"I'm back, I found some pretty water."
While I was sharing body heat with Shiona, Tippy called out to me from behind.
For some reason, I felt embarrassed, and I instinctively distanced myself from Shiona.
The warmth that had been touching my skin was snatched away by the air.
But that gap was immediately filled with a new warmth.
When I looked, Tippy had stepped in between me and Shiona.
"Tippy too—hug."
Shiona and I looked at each other.
Shiona seemed to be entrusting the decision to me.
Tippy has lived in solitude for two hundred years.
If things continue as they are, Tippy will be able to live semi-permanently without breaking.
But, is that happiness?
Does an empty life have any value?
I embraced Shiona.
Including Tippy, who was standing between us.
Shiona embraced me in the same way.
Tippy hugged both of us and muttered softly.
"Warm..."
It was warmth for the first time in two hundred years.
Tippy had been waiting for something so trivial for two hundred years.
That was a very sad time...
If I could give Tippy two hundred years' worth of warmth, I would definitely want to give it to her.
Because then, I feel like I could say that the time Tippy was waiting wasn't wasted.
"What are we going to do now, Rei?"
Shiona asks me while hugging Tippy from behind.
"If we can... I still want to help everyone in town... but I don't think I can right now."
I feel bad for the townspeople, but I don't have the power to do so.
First, I want to ensure the safety of Shiona and Tippy.
"It's a little far, but let's go to the factory where I woke up."
No, that place probably wasn't a factory.
A facility where people who could no longer live in the world due to war would continue to sleep until the polluted land was at least a little better.
My... awakening was a little late.
"Electricity was still running there. Shiona and I can ingest food, so if we have the food we brought from town, we can manage. But in Tippy's case, she needs to be charged."
"Shiona..."
She probably realized it just from those words. Tippy raised her voice.
"Yes, that's right... I'm sorry."
"No. I thought I had to say it soon."
Tippy continues, sounding somewhat sad, yet with a slightly stiff expression.
"Tippy too, has to do what Tippy can... while I still can."
"...Tippy-chan?"
Something must have caught her, Shiona questions Tippy.
"The three of us, let's survive."
Those were aimless words.
With no guarantees or anything.
Even so, I could only continue to say those words.
"We will, always, always survive together, the three of us."
It was just an ideal.
I know that the world isn't sweet enough to live on ideals alone.
Of course, Shiona probably does too.
Even so, Shiona doesn't raise any questions to me.
Anxiety or dissatisfaction.
She had sealed all those words away.
Surely her heart must have been filled with them.
In fact, my heart was being trampled by those emotions.
Even so, it's necessary.
Words of hope.
"...Yeah."
Shiona nodded and hugged me and Tippy even tighter.
And so, we began our journey towards the facility.
"This is, outside the town..."
Witnessing the wilderness, Tippy clutches her bear plush to her chest.
“Is this different from the scenery Tippy knows?”
“Yeah. When I saw it before, there was a road, and a forest, and then—and then—”
The scenery Tippy described was like an even grander version of the festival-like days Shiona had told me about.
It seems that back then, humans freely manipulated not only towns, but also nature, the Phylloids, and even the weather.
“So… it seems that when I started operating, humans were already beginning to decline…”
Shiona seems a little lonely. The hem of her clothes is blown wildly by the dust-filled wind.
“Alright, let’s go!”
With a little food and a spare battery for Tippy, we started walking through the wilderness to survive.
And more than anything, to survive.
Struggling, struggling, to survive.
Floundering, floundering, to stay alive.
Just being alive is enough.
Just being alive had value.
I truly thought so from the bottom of my heart.
Using the position of the sun, faintly discernible through the dim clouds, as a guide, I walk while searching my memory.
As the sun sets and the temperature drops, the three of us huddle together and fall asleep.
Sometimes singing songs, sometimes encouraging each other, sometimes joking around…
We continue on a journey that is not just painful.
It was around sunset, after three full days, that we crossed the reddish-brown earth and reached our destination.
“The building is half-buried in sand… no wonder we couldn’t find it. I can’t believe this facility was still here…”
As we entered, faint lights flickered on, and the air conditioning hummed faintly from somewhere.
The room was exactly as it had been when I woke up. For now, I gathered up all the Phylloid parts that would be unpleasant for Shiona and Tippy.
I'm sure these Phylloids were protecting us humans in cold sleep.
“Yay, I can sit down~”
Tippy rushed over and was the first to sit on the provided sofa.
As soon as she sat down, the strength drained from her body.
It seems I had been pushing her quite hard.
“…It’s kind of cold here.”
“It was originally a facility for cold sleep, after all.”
Even though we're indoors, it's a little colder than outside.
Since the air conditioning is working, I'd like to think that the function to raise the temperature in the facility is still working too.
But I don't know where it is.
“I wish we had some kind of heater…”
“I know what to do. Rei, sit next to Tippy-chan.”
“Like this?”
“Get closer!”
“L-Like this?”
When I asked that, almost pressed against Tippy, Shiona looked satisfied and said,
“Yeah, this should be fine!”
And then Shiona sat on the opposite side of me from Tippy, where we were pressed together.
—Pressed together tightly, just like me and Tippy.
“See? Isn’t it warmer this way?”
“Y-Yeah… I guess so.”
It's certainly warm. It's warm, but…
“How is it, Tippy-chan? Are you still cold?”
“Hmm… warm.”
Tippy narrowed her eyes and snuggled against my arm.
“Warm? Oh, good.”
“Yeah, warm… so very warm, Rei. It’s like…”
“Like what?”
“When we’re like this, it’s like we’re a family.”
“............”
“Tippy’s papa and mama used to hug Tippy like this a lot.”
“Yeah. It’s like that time, it’s warm.”
“...Yeah, it’s warm.”
“...Hey, can you hug me again? Can you hold Tippy tight?”
I almost hugged her without thinking, but I stopped when I felt Shiona's sad gaze.
“Tippy-chan, I can’t do that.”
“Why? Won’t you hug me?”
“Yes, that’s right. Because Tippy-chan, we aren’t family or anything.”
“Not family… Tippy’s all alone?”
“Yes. No matter how long we’re together, you’re alone. That’s something that can’t be changed.”
If you only picked up the words, they were cold, as if she hated Tippy.
But now I understand.
Those words are full of kindness.
The only emotion left within Tippy.
—Sadness.
To fill Tippy’s heart would be to release her from her sadness…
In other words, it would be the same as her dying.
Until now, I had been hugging Tippy without thinking.
But perhaps that was a kindness that was far too cruel.
No, perhaps it wasn’t even kindness at all.
It was nothing more than a self-satisfying act that only shortened Tippy’s lifespan.
Shiona had been enduring it all this time.
To protect Tippy’s feelings of sadness… more than anything, to protect Tippy.
She must have really wanted to hug her.
She must have wanted to pat her head and say kind words to her.
She must have wanted to give her a smile that turned her heart orange.
Without reaching out to this blue girl, she had been enduring it all this time.
That's why I thought I had to endure it too.
That's what I thought—…but I couldn't stop myself.
I just couldn't bring myself to leave this girl with such a sad expression in front of me.
I embraced Tippy, and Shiona along with her.
The back of my eyes started to burn.
I know this is an act that shortens Tippy's lifespan, but I ask myself why I can't stop.
Aren't I just temporarily satisfying my own desires…?
I really am just a human…
Selfish, full of self-interest, a human who hurts others.
I hugged them both tightly, painfully so.
I embraced the warmth of two people.
As if filling a two-hundred-year void, we drew our warmth closer.
The warmth of three people didn't let us feel the cold, even in the freezing facility.
It was that warm.
A melody naturally spilled from Shiona's mouth.
That song that Onii-san made.
That melody lights a warmth deep within my heart.
Her gentle singing voice echoed throughout the factory.
"Tippy, you know, Tippy loves this song that Shiona sings."
Tippy said, burying her face in my chest.
"It reminds me of when Papa and Mama were here... and for some reason, the tears just won't stop."
The girl repeats her sadness.
Tippy has been repeating that sadness for two hundred years.
I might not be able to wipe away those two hundred years of sadness.
But I can give her this moment of warmth.
I decided to put those two hundred years' worth into this fleeting warmth and embrace them both.
But that small amount of time didn't last long.
"Huh... Tippy?"
I turn my gaze to Tippy, who is sitting on the sofa.
There, Tippy was blankly staring ahead.
"What's wrong? Are you feeling sick or something?"
"Hmm? ...Hmm..."
She doesn't seem to be doing well.
Is it because she's been released from the tension, or because she's been walking for so long?
Either way, it seems like she needs to rest.
"Tippy seems tired too, so should we rest for today?"
"...Y-yes."
Her reply is a beat late. It seems she was thinking about something.
"Rei, Tippy-chan might be lacking energy. That might be why her attention is scattered."
"I see... then we need to replenish her electricity. --But, how do we do that?"
"It's contactless charging. The charging equipment should be common, so first we need to find the connector and charge the bear plushie."
"Understood. I'll ask you to confirm if I find something that looks like it."
"Leave it to me!"
Leaving Tippy on the sofa, I start checking the equipment inside the facility.
Many cold sleep devices are lined up. I look for one that is still leaking cold air.
Then, I opened the maintenance cover at the base and examined some of the cables connected to the distribution panel.
Before long, I discovered something that looked like a power connector connected to a thick cable.
"Yes, this type is fine. Tippy-chan, please lend me the plushie."
Shiona borrows the bear plushie from Tippy, opens the zipper on its back, and exposes the connection terminal.
When she inserts the charging connector there, the bear's eyes blink twice.
That must be the signal that charging has started, and Shiona breathes a sigh of relief.
Tippy also tightly grips the bear's hand. Just by doing that, the power must be transmitted, as the light in her eyes seems to have intensified.
"Shiona, let's have a meal too."
I show her the oral blocks I found when I was looking for the charging cable.
It's the same thing I found when I left this facility.
"The taste is nothing compared to Shiona's soup, but I think it has all the nutrients."
"No, I'm happy because I was hungry. Just being able to eat makes my heart feel warm."
I line up the portable dishes and place the oral blocks on top of them.
I thought this would make it look a little more like a meal.
Because it's a time like this, I want to cherish the everyday things, even the small ones.
I wanted to emulate, even just a little, what we used to do at Shiona's house in that town.
"It looks delicious."
As if understanding my wish, Shiona smiled at me.
The two of us put our hands together before the meal.
Seeing this, Tippy comes to our side.
Then, she places the bear plushie in front of us and puts her hands together just like we did.
"Together with everyone."
"Tippy-chan...?"
"Haha, Tippy is a great feast. Very luxurious."
Tippy looked shy and bashful.
It was a time of peace in the midst of these past few days filled with hardship.
Surely in the distant past, we humans lived such a life with our partners called Phylloids.
No, it should be a life we can still reclaim.
Just like I, who had lost my emotions, was taught by them... I should be able to reclaim the time I had forgotten...
I thought about such things as I brought the remaining oral block on the plate to my mouth.
--That's when it happened.
『Warning. The wear rate of the main battery exceeds 90%. Please replace and maintain the battery immediately.』
Suddenly, Tippy started saying such things in a businesslike tone.
『Online replacement request will be made to the service center -- the service center is offline. Retrying. -- The service center is offline. Retrying. -- The service center is offline. Retrying...』
"Shiona, what is this--!"
"I don't know the details, but it seems Tippy-chan's battery can no longer be charged."
"Can't be charged..."
Different voltage? No, that shouldn't be a problem since it's going through the bear plushie.
In that case, is there a problem with the battery itself?
If there's a possibility... could it be deterioration over time? Come to think of it, it's a battery that's been running for over 200 years.
It wouldn't be surprising if it was completely worn out.
"Maybe we need a new battery..."
"A brand new battery... Besides, I think Tippy-chan's generation couldn't be replaced without a specialized technician disassembling it first...!"
"No way..."
Cold sweat ran down my back.
In other words, Tippy will stop functioning as is -- no, will she die?
"No, after coming all this way...!"
"It's okay... I knew this would happen."
Tippy's voice returned to its usual tone, and we could only stare as if struck by lightning.
"Tippy-chan, you knew this was going to happen, didn't you--"
"Yes... I thought this would happen since I left the library. I also noticed that the battery charging rate had been dropping since 6427 days ago."
Tippy answered with a weak smile.
"More importantly, Tippy has to do what Tippy can do... Rei, could you bring me the metal briefcase that Tippy had?"
"O-Okay!"
The slim, yet somewhat rugged metal briefcase that Tippy had been carrying ever since she left the library. It was heavier than expected, and I carried it in front of Tippy.
Tippy casually places one hand in the middle of the briefcase. With just that, the two locks on the handle side automatically unlocked.
Inside was a single black board. Its size was about that of a slightly larger book. However, it was much thinner, only about half the size of a short picture book.
Tippy carefully took it out with both hands and slowly turned to face me.
"Rei. Place your palm here. Not the mechanical one."
"Like this?"
As Tippy told me, I placed my non-prosthetic hand on the black board. Then--
A fluent male voice echoed from the black board.
"Current administrator, Vortex Company MSK-3737 model name 'Dorothy' individual name 'Tippy' has approved the continuation of work. Continuing registration."
"Confirmed. Registration applicant, please state the name to identify the individual."
"Um... Rei."
"Understood. We have registered <Rei> as the new administrator. Please receive a verbal explanation of how to use it from the current administrator. That is all."
Having said that, the black board fell silent.
"Tippy, what was that just now...?"
"All the books that were in the library, digitized. It's a backup of Tippy's memory storage."
Tippy answered in a slightly tired--yet somehow accomplished--tone.
I recall the many handwritten books lined up in the library.
Tippy, who remembered every single word written there without error.
So, Tippy was the one who wrote those books after all.
Even if she were to stop someday... no, predicting that she would stop, so that she could leave a record of the prehistoric civilization as a book.
That place wasn't just a library. Tippy herself was the library.
"When you use it, place your hand in the middle of the board, just like before. That should make the tablet--the board--light up. After that, you'll be able to call up all the data with the administrator's voice recognition function..."
"Then--"
As Tippy told me, I activated the board called a tablet. I placed my palm on it as I was told.
『Biometrics confirmed, administrator Rei authenticated. Which data would you like to load?』
"The manual! How to repair a Phylloid... um, how to replace the battery!"
『Initiating search... There are 3,195 items and 124,751 types of information regarding Phylloid repair methods. Narrowing down the search is recommended.』
"From those, Vortex Company MSK-3737 model 'Dorothy'."
『Initiating search... Condition matched.』
The surface of the tablet glowed brightly. Then, letters appeared.
『Repair by the user is almost impossible. Please allow it to rest until personnel from the service center arrive.』
My vision went dark.
"How is it? Is it working well?"
"Yeah, it's working... but..."
"That tablet... only has about fifty years left... to work..."
It's more than enough time for me, but it probably isn't that long for a Phylloid or a library management system.
"Are you sure it's okay for me to use it?"
"Rather, use it. From now on... Tippy won't be useful anymore..."
"That's not true! Tippy has always been helping me!"
When I fixed Siona's music box, when I fixed Mad's projector. All of that was possible because Tippy remembered the library's collection so well and taught me.
"It makes me happy to hear you say that, Rei--please use this from now on..."
Tippy, who had been sitting on the sofa, slowly laid down.
"Tippy-chan!"
I waited for two hundred years.
I can't let it end here.
Tippy's small mouth moved up and down, opening and closing.
It looks like he's saying something, but his voice is so small that I can't hear it.
I brought my ear close to his mouth.
"Hey, Rei... Tippy had fun."
Tippy's hand was placed on top of mine.
It's a small, soft hand.
"Rei as my father, Siona as my mother... both of you are kind, a family I love very much."
No matter how coldly I treated him, no matter how much I pushed him away, I couldn't hide my true feelings.
Tippy had noticed.
How much we cherished Tippy.
From the moment we got involved, it was decided that Tippy would end up like this.
That there was nothing we could do about it.
That being alone forever was the only way Tippy could survive.
But that's impossible, isn't it?
Tippy has emotions.
We're not perfect enough to overlook sadness.
No, that's not what you call perfect.
Because we can feel sadness, we are allowed to have emotions.
Slowly.
Like a handkerchief falling into the water and sinking, Tippy's eyes are closing.
Even though Tippy is a Philoid that we created, we can't even save him.
We just create them and then can't do anything else.
Humans are truly selfish creatures.
"Hey, Siona..."
Tippy's eyelids slowly opened again. But the light has already gone out of his eyes. He probably can't see anymore.
"I'm here... I'm here, Tippy-chan..."
Siona's voice was trembling slightly.
"I'm glad... Hey, Siona."
"Yes...?"
"Thank you for everything. You worked hard to keep Tippy from breaking, didn't you?"
"I think you realize this, but Tippy has been running for over two hundred years since starting up... but the lifespan was originally one hundred and fifty years. So, this isn't Siona's or Rei's fault. It was meant to be..."
When Tippy left the library and came to the church, Siona apologized to Tippy, and Tippy forgave her.
That's what that meant...
"So, please. Siona, don't cry... Sing... Sing a song..."
"Yes... Yes--!"
"Tippy... Siona's song... I love it."
Siona began to sing a song. She hiccuped every now and then, throwing off the tune. Even so, Siona continued to sing. To that melody--.
"Tha...nk... yooou..."
Tippy smiled--and then stopped moving.
My hands trembled.
It wasn't just my hands.
My whole body was trembling.
Just now, on my lap, another small life had come to an end.
Some people might say it wasn't a life.
But to me, it was an irreplaceable life.
Siona quietly continues to sing.
The tune isn't off anymore. It's the same as always--but that song had a transparent resonance that reached everywhere.
It was a melody dedicated to Tippy.
Something hot streamed down my cheeks.
It ran down my chin and fell onto Tippy's cheek.
Tippy isn't crying, but it looks like he is.
I hugged Tippy close to me.
That small body will never move again.
That mouth will never speak again.
Those hands will never draw again.
That is "Death."
Warmth spread through my head.
Siona was hugging me.
Suddenly, my eyes grew hot.
This is overflowing emotion. Unbearable pain, uncontrollable sadness... and overwhelming grief.
For the first time in my life, I shed "tears."
Tears for Tippy--.
After that, our lives changed drastically.
The e-reader containing all the library's books that Tippy entrusted to me.
Thanks to what was once called a tablet, my knowledge increased rapidly.
How to grow crops, houses that can be made with just stone and mud, how to predict the weather, and the many animals and plants that can no longer be seen.
Furthermore, a database of newspapers spanning the past 350 years until the library ceased functioning.
I'm sure if I searched, I could even find information about myself.
"Ray, are you studying again today?"
"Yeah. There are tons of things I need to remember."
"What kind of book are you reading today?"
"Survival--how to survive in any environment."
The power supply to the cold sleep facility wasn't that great. If that's the case, I need to be able to manage to some extent with only a small amount of power.
I've already started securing drinking water using morning and evening dew, and the problem of securing drinking water, which was the weakest point of this facility, is improving considerably.
Yes, from here on out, we can no longer move forward by simply relying on physical strength like before.
From now on, what we need is knowledge. With knowledge, even against many opponents, I can stand alone, or even avoid confrontation altogether--or even win.
It might even become possible to help the people of the town.
I greedily absorbed the "power" that Tippy left behind.
While I was reading, Siona was singing beside Tippy, who had stopped moving.
Among the luggage we brought from the town was Siona's older brother's music box.
Occasionally, instead of singing, she would turn the handle and play the music box's gentle melody.
It was a very peaceful and comforting time.
With my current "knowledge," it would be possible to live here with Siona forever.
That's why... I didn't notice.
That there was something wrong with Siona's body...
"Ray, dinner's ready."
As always, Siona prepares the meal with a smile.
She dissolves the oral block in water, making it into a soup.
It closely resembles the orange, fluffy soup that Siona always made for me in town.
"Thank you, this soup makes me feel better."
"I'm happy to hear you say that. It makes my heart orange."
"But Siona, your soup, the amount is small, isn't it?"
The amount of soup in the bowl is less than half of mine.
"I'm a Philoid, so if I go into save mode, this amount is enough."
"Is that so?"
"Yeah. So Ray, make sure you eat well. You won't have any energy if you're hungry, right?"
Ah... why couldn't I have noticed?
At this time... her functions as a Philoid were already declining...
She was only operating at a level sufficient for half the energy I was consuming.
As always, I read my books, and Siona sang for me.
While tracing the surface of the tablet with my fingertip, I pondered if there was a way to free the people of the town.
Suddenly, the rhythm of the comfortably flowing song stopped.
Wondering if something was wrong, I looked up to see Siona frozen, holding her hand to her mouth.
The music box she was holding had also stopped.
"Siona...? What's wrong?"
"Um... no, it's nothing. It's just the song..."
She said that and took a deep breath.
And then she started singing again, but──
"...Huh? What was the pitch again...?"
"Sio...na...?"
"Ahaha... that's strange, even though it's a song I loved so much, just wait a moment, I'll remember it soon..."
Siona closed her eyes and tried to sing from the place where she kept stopping.
But the melody flowing from her mouth was completely different from what I knew.
"What's wrong... I can't remember my brother's song..."
"Siona!? Is there anything wrong with your body!?"
I was an idiot. In the end, I was only thinking about myself.
Being treated kindly and cherished by Siona, I was satisfied with that, spoiled... I wasn't thinking about her.
Even though she was caught in an explosion that caused her to lose the artificial skin on her arm when we left town.
"Siona! At the time of that explosion, you were actually seriously injured, weren't you!"
Siona thought for a moment, then shook her head.
"I was okay then, yeah."
Siona──Philoids don't lie.
But, thinking about humans, she will hide her words.
Since she said she was okay, there probably wasn't any damage from being caught in the explosion.
As she said──"then."
"...Siona. Could you show me what's wrong with you?"
"...Okay."
Urged by me, Siona hesitated only once before nodding.
I almost averted my eyes in embarrassment at the suddenness of it, but what was there wouldn't let my gaze go.
Siona's white, firm chest.
There, a small hole was open.
"That is..."
Forgetting that it was a woman's body, I approached the wound.
This is a gunshot wound.
I immediately remember the time at Mad's shop when she protected me from the humans.
"It hit...it really hit you..."
"I was wondering if I was okay, but it seems that wasn't the case."
Siona stuck out her tongue and smiled like a child caught doing something mischievous, but without showing any remorse.
I know that's a smile to keep me from feeling guilty.
Even at a time like this, she's thinking of me.
"...Ghk, search! MODA-117 Alice mk-17 Maintenance Manual!"
Reacting to my voice, the tablet glows faintly.
But Siona covered the screen with her hand. And slowly shook her head.
Without letting her smile fade.
"It's my body. I know it best."
"But...there might be a way! If you had told me sooner..."
──No, there's a reason she didn't say anything.
Siona knew it, that she had a fatal injury that couldn't be fixed.
That no matter how much I struggled, it wouldn't change the reality.
It's something that's too horrible to even put into words.
The word 'death' floated in my head.
No matter how much I don't want to think about it, it just pops into my head.
"I know. I'm going to die soon. Since I'm a Philoid, should I say 'break down'?"
No, Siona.
You're not going to break down.
I'm going to die.
"Ahaha, I guess I've lost a little focus, I can't put any strength in my body..."
As if her shoulders dropped with a thud, Siona fell straight toward the floor.
"Siona!"
I hurriedly caught her, holding her in a position that would be as comfortable as possible.
How long has she been like this?
Why couldn't I have noticed...?
"Breaking down...does that mean I'll stop being me...? But, I wonder if I can be fixed...?"
"It's okay...Siona is Siona..."
"Ahaha...you know, right now...I'm a little scared..."
"Siona...Siona..."
"Don't cry, Rei. Tippy-chan will laugh at you if you do."
Siona's hand reaches for my cheek.
It was my second tear that she brushed away with her fingertip.
"I don't want Rei to turn blue.... I always want you to be orange and fluffy..."
Sad.
An immense sadness wells up.
It multiplies infinitely in my heart, never ceasing.
As time passes, that sadness becomes more intense.
Why am I so sad?
The answer comes to me immediately.
Because you're important to me.
You were an important person to me.
Even if a Philoid that looked exactly like you appeared before me, it wouldn't mean anything.
It's okay if you look different.
As long as your heart is yours.
"Rei... you know, I thought of you as family. It's partly because you reminded me of my older brother, but it's not just that. I thought you were important,"
Family.
It's a bond where you believe in and help each other unconditionally, without any personal gain.
That is 'love'.
The emotion I had unconsciously been craving.
I had unknowingly realized that emotion.
I had been given it all along... all along.
It's an emotion that's so natural when living and walking alongside someone.
"What's wrong, Rei... don't make such a sad face... That's right, let's sing a song, let's go to the plaza again... everyone will be happy."
"...Siona...?"
"It's something I promised everyone. Rei gave everyone smiles, made them feel happy."
It was a memory from happier times. A memory of the fun days we spent in town.
It's probably just memory corruption.
But...
"...Yeah, let's sing. Everyone's looking forward to it."
I turned the handle of the music box that was placed on the floor.
A melody begins to flow quietly.
Siona's cheeks relaxed, and she closed her eyes and began to sing.
I closed my eyes as well, listening to the melody and reminiscing.
It wasn't a long time, but I recalled the scenery of that town I spent time in.
People walking down the street stopped and turned to look at us.
One by one, people gathered in the plaza.
Children, the elderly, someone's mother, her husband, the townspeople all began to smile.
As if intoxicated by Siona's singing melody.
Surely that scene was something that was taken for granted a long time ago.
Regardless of whether they were human or Philoid, they smiled and spent their time close to each other.
It's something we've forgotten... something we've lost that was taken for granted...
"Hey, Rei... always, always keep smiling, okay?"
"...Yeah."
"It's okay to be sad, it's okay to be angry... But... after that, smile."
"Hey... if love has a shape, it's definitely round. Because love never hurts anyone."
Holding back my tears, I smile.
"Hey... if love has a temperature, it's definitely warm. Because love warms you up as if enveloping you."
"Yeah... I'm sure it is."
"Because there's love, Rei won't be sad. Because love is something that protects, and it won't hurt Rei. I promise. No matter what happens from now on, our love will protect Rei."
I had cried so much that my eyes were starting to hurt.
My vision blurred.
But even through that, I could see Siona's smile clearly.
"So don't cry. Love is always by your side. Because love is eternal. You don't have to cry. Because it's forever."
I placed my hand on Siona's hand that was on my cheek.
It was warm, but she had almost no strength left.
It was as if something was spilling out from between her fingers.
I knew what was spilling out.
But I didn't want to admit it.
I gripped her hand tightly, wishing that it wouldn't spill out.
I could hear a song.
The warm melody that Siona always hummed.
It seeped into the gaps in my darkening heart, filling it with warmth.
"I'm sorry, for leaving you alone again."
"--! That's not true. That's not true!"
I wanted to tear at my own head.
I finally realized it now.
Siona wasn't afraid of breaking. She was afraid of me being alone again.
"I... I received so much, so much from Siona...!"
"Rei?"
I take Siona's mechanical hand with my human hand.
That's right, until I met Siona, I was an ambivalent existence, unable to become either human or Philoid.
Siona stayed by my side the whole time—and I was able to become human.
"Siona will always be inside me, I'm not alone anymore. Joy, sadness, anger... I received it all from you. I'll never forget."
Ah... Damn it, I have to smile here.
I have to reassure Siona, but my emotions won't allow it...
No matter how hard I try, tears spill out from the rising sadness.
"So Siona, don't make such a sad face. I'll be okay. I'll definitely be okay."
"I see... then, I'm glad."
Siona nodded, looking satisfied.
"Huh..."
Siona narrowed her eyes as if puzzled. Then, as if pushed out by her eyelids, transparent droplets began to cover her eyes.
"I'm sure... that's different..."
I say in a trembling voice, smiling reassuringly at Siona.
Now that I've become human, I understand the meaning of those tears.
Siona seemed to realize it too, and smiled back at me.
"Tears... they also flow when you're happy, right?"
The strength slowly drains from Siona's body.
Am I smiling? Am I?
Am I able to smile, so Siona won't worry?
"...See you later."
"...Yeah, see you later."
With a sigh.
Siona closed her eyes.
In that instant, Siona had the most beautiful face I had ever seen, probably.
And after that, Siona never opened her eyes again.
That peaceful face looks like it's smiling.
As if she's praying for my happiness.
But there's no happiness in a world without Siona.
The life that continues for me from now on is hell itself.
Can I endure it?
...No, I have to endure it.
My chest tightens so much it hurts.
All emotions run through my body, creaking.
Is my heart this fragile and weak?
Is losing someone precious this painful?
"Uwaah... Aah...!!"
My vision is dyed pure white, and I cried out, as if to destroy that world.
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah...!

Siona said.
Certainly, Siona's love might be eternal.
But, I couldn't bear it.
I understand, this is emotion.
What Siona gave me.
This suffering, this sorrow too.
But, it's not just that.
The warmth barely remaining in my chest, and the memories with everyone that I can proudly say were fun.
All of that too, Siona gave me.
Both of them are mine now.
I will never let go of either.
How much time has passed?
How much time does a human need to sort out their feelings?
I... was remembering the time I met Siona, over and over again.
The meals we ate together.
The times we woke up in the morning and exchanged greetings.
We went shopping together.
I went to the abandoned factory and made her worry.
She was so happy when the music box was fixed.
We sang in the town square, surrounded by smiles.
I made a promise...
I learned warmth.
I learned joy.
There were times I felt anger.
There were times I shed tears of sadness.
And... I received love.
──No... everything was love.
This tragedy was brought about by the foolishness of us humans, who lost that love.
Humans are hopelessly selfish.
We repeat the same mistakes...
Even so, we will need someone.
It's instinct. Even when I woke up here, I wanted to see a human.
It's the instinct to seek love, to want to walk alongside someone.
We can't even realize something so simple...
I look at the cold sleep devices in front of me.
I had Siona and Tipi sleeping in the few that were still left and functioning properly.
They were originally for humans, but this should suppress aging to some extent.
I wanted to preserve their appearances, even just a little.
Standing before the two who looked as if they were only sleeping, I mutter.
"Siona, Tipi... I'm going now."
There's no reply.
There couldn't be.
But, I continued.
"I'm going on a journey now. Don't worry, it's not aimless. I'm going to find a world where humans and Filoides can coexist."
That was also the wish spoken by that human youth who was rejected.
If there were a world where humans and Filoides could coexist, this kind of sadness wouldn't happen.
If there were a world where humans and Filoides could coexist, there would be no greater joy.
That's why I'm going to find it now.
"And, if that world doesn't exist──"
I clench my iron fist as if covering it with my bare palm.
"──No, it definitely exists. The world that you tried to leave for us humans definitely exists."
Finding it will be extremely difficult.
But, I have the knowledge that Tipi gave me.
And, I have the emotions that Siona gave me.
I have a partner in this world who continues to convey "love."
That's why this journey isn't a journey of despair.
"I'll borrow this, okay? I'll come back to return it someday."
In my hand is Siona's older brother's music box.
I turn the handle in front of the sleeping Siona, letting the melody of peace contained within resonate.
In time with that melody, I felt like I could hear her song.
"Well then, I'm off."
A world where humans and Filoides can hold hands--.
I took that first step.
"Even so, I remained hopeful and continued to reach both arms toward the light."
"Are you awake?"
"...Where... is this...?"
"You've awakened from a long sleep. Do you remember your name?"
My name is...
"I am Asou International model MODA-117 Alice mk-17. An individual name has not been set."
"It seems the settings have been initialized. For now, Alice will do."
The man before me held out an old-fashioned wooden box.
"What's this...?"
"It was inside the device you were sleeping in."
I take the box. It felt very nostalgic.
When I opened the lid, there was a dull golden disc. When I turned the handle on the side of the box, a clear tone began to play.
A very beautiful melody flowing as the metal comb is gently plucked.
"It's a song that's been played since long ago."
A melody that isn't in my records.
But even so, it's very nostalgic, warm, and my chest feels all warm and fuzzy.
And at the same time...
Hot tears streamed from my eyes.
"Emotion function runaway detected. Maintenance may be required."
"No, that won't be necessary. You should cherish those emotions. ...Only the knowledge was left behind, but it took a long time to recover the technology to utilize it. I'm sorry."
The man spoke to me gently.
I felt a nostalgic trace in his expression as well.
Not in my records... my memories...
"For now, let's go home after we finish the routine maintenance."
"Where to?"
"To town."
The outside of the facility was dazzling.
The sky was blue and endlessly high. White clouds flowed slowly, drawing various shapes.
Warm air filled my artificial lungs. A gentle breeze softly caressed my hair.
It was a natural scene.
For some reason, I felt nostalgic for this ordinary world.
And... for some reason, I felt very sad.
We drove along the paved road.
Every scene visible from the window was beautiful.
Lush greenery thrived.
Small fish leaped on the surface of a clear stream.
In the sky, small birds chirped and flew together harmoniously.
"Alright, we're here."
Passing through the gate, we arrived at a town surrounded by white walls.
It was overflowing with people.
Humans and Phylloids alike were holding hands, living their ordinary lives.
That sight made my eyes grow hot again.
"Excuse me, there's still a risk of emotional function runaway. The rhythm pattern in my chest is also not at a normal value."
"It's alright. I'm sure it's the right thing."
"Is that so? In that case, am I a defective product?"
"No, you're perfectly normal. You're closer to a human than any other Phylloid."
Those words were very pleasing to me as a Phylloid.
But I don't understand why I'm told that.
I gazed intently at the town that I felt nostalgic for.
In a corner of the plaza, a human child and a child-type Phylloid were playing happily.
That's a photo studio. The Phylloid owner was smiling as he took pictures of a human family.
At a general store in a separate location, a human was shopping and the Phylloid owner was dealing with them curtly.
"Sensei, welcome back!"
A very cute Phylloid girl came running towards me.
"Hello, I'm back. Have you been a good girl, Dorothy?"
"Yes! I drew lots of pictures while Sensei was gone. Look!"
The little girl showed me a picture she had probably drawn, with a beaming smile on her face.
The townspeople are in a circle, laughing.
The picture drawn with crayons is so warm, just looking at it makes my heart feel warm.
It was a picture that made everyone who saw it feel happy.
"Huh? You are..."
The girl looks up at me.
"Nice to meet you. I'm Alice, nice to meet you."
"Ali...ce? Hello, Alice. Dorothy is Dorothy because she isn't properly registered."
"Yeah, me too."
An unregistered Phylloid. If there's no primary partner, what should I do?
Perhaps sensing my anxiety, the man next to me patted me on the shoulder.
"What do you want to do?"
"...What can I do...?"
"Alice, can you sing a song?"
"Yes, a song. Like this."
Dorothy closes her eyes and begins to sing.
It was a little clumsy, but it was a familiar song.
"It's a song that's been sung since long, long ago. There's no one in the world who doesn't know it."
The man said, taking a music box out of the car.
He opened the lid and turned the handle sticking out from the side of the box.
A clear sound was released, and a gentle melody began to flow.
As if drawn to the melody, the townspeople begin to gather.
Everyone listens to the sound, their expressions becoming peaceful.
I know this scene.
In the deepest part of my memory, which should be completely blank--a memory that breathes softly gently taps my heart.
My mouth moved naturally.
The song, which should be the first time I've sung it, was familiar to my throat, my lips...my heart.
The music box melody filling the square is very nostalgic.
Wow, that's so pretty. You're so good!
Yes, this song... is a very important song.
