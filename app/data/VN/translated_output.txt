──The air shifted.
The pale blue light that had been enveloping me until now receded.
What I eventually saw was a grimy ceiling.
My right arm, which I extended towards that spot, was slightly different from my left arm, which I also extended.
My right arm was made of exposed mechanical parts from the wrist down.
My fingers moved smoothly, but each time, a faint metallic scraping sound echoed.
Next, I slowly raised my upper body.
I then realized that the identity of the pale blue light that had been in my field of vision was an oval-shaped lid with a gentle curve.
It seems I was asleep inside this capsule-like thing.
Where is this place?
Who am I?
Why am I here?
Even when I asked myself these questions, I couldn't find the answers.
Even when I tried to trace back my memories, all I had was the memory of the pale blue light.
In order to find a clue to my memories, I decided to get out of the capsule and wander around the room.
Even though I knew the act of walking, perhaps it had been a long time since I had done it, as my footing was unsteady.
I paid attention not to fall over, and slowly moved forward.
The drifting air was lukewarm, and each time I took air into my lungs, dust clung to my throat.
Light from outside streamed in through a hole in the ceiling, revealing dust in the air along its path.
Perhaps no one has entered this building for quite some time.
A thin layer of dust spreads across the floor.
What is this place used for, I wonder?
Countless oval capsules were scattered throughout the large room.
Most of them are open.
The insides are empty.
Even if some are closed, there's nothing inside.
It seems I'm the only one in this room.
…No, that's not quite right, to be precise.
There are people who exist, leaning against the oval objects or lying on the floor.
But, no. That's not quite right.
Those aren't exactly people.
It would be more accurate to call them humanoid objects.
Those humanoid objects had mechanical parts peeking out from under their skin.
Some had mechanical parts from the neck up.
Some had exposed mechanical arms.
Some had their lower bodies torn off, revealing mechanical parts.
And then, I remembered what those humanoid objects were.
Partners for humans, created for humans.
Equipped with not only the five senses but also emotions, they are the closest existence to humans.
I reach out my hand to a Philoid that has ceased functioning.
The hand with exposed parts not covered by skin looked exactly like my right hand.
This is a factory.
I was made here.
…It seems the facility was abandoned for some reason just before completion.
I stare at my mechanical right hand, not yet covered in artificial skin, and conclude the most likely possibility.
Having understood my own existence, I started walking towards the wall.
There was an old automatic door, and right next to it, a liquid crystal panel displaying 《CLOSE》 was covered in dust.
I touched it with my mechanical hand.
The moment I felt something cold like electricity at my bloodless fingertips, it displayed 《OPEN》 and the door opened.
Can I get outside from here?
Is anyone left in this facility?
I wanted to meet someone.
I wanted to meet a human.
Let's go find them, my partner.
I pushed open the door leading outside.
In order to prove my own existence.
When I returned home, I headed straight for the living room.
There was a broken music box there.
I unraveled a book I borrowed from the library and learned about its structure.
Just as I thought, the gears inside were chipped.
That's why no matter how much I turn the handle, the disc won't spin and no sound will come out.
…But what should I do about these gears?
Would it be possible to make them according to the size written in the book? No, it's impossible.
With no answer in sight, I continued turning the pages of the book.
At the end of the book, there was a list of products for each manufacturer, and a list of parts used.
As I skimmed through it, my eyes caught on something.
What I understood there was that the manufacturer that made this music box also made clocks.
If that's the case, then the parts for the precise sections might be the same as those used in clocks.
Suddenly, I remembered what I broke at Mad's shop.
That clock… if they're going to throw it away because it's unusable…
If I use the gears and other parts from the clock, I might be able to fix the music box.
"Rei, what are you doing?"
At the same time as I saw the possibility of repair, Shiona came into the living room.
"Shiona, listen. I might be able to fix the music box with the parts from the clock that was at Mad's shop."
"Really? Is that true?"
Shiona had an even more joyful smile than usual.
From that expression, I could understand Shiona's joy.
"But don't push yourself too hard, okay? We can still sing even without the music box."
Shiona picked up the music box and began to sing.
That song she sang in the chapel.
That song, somehow nostalgic.
That song, that warms the depths of my heart.
Looking at Shiona, who gazes at the music box with affection, my resolve grows stronger.
I want to fix this music box for her.
And I want to make Shiona happy.
That feeling swells up inside me.
"I'm going to Mad's shop again tomorrow."
I'll try to ask him if he can let me have the clock somehow.
But there was one thing that worried me.
That is, I was the one who broke that clock.
I apologized, but it's still hard to go there.
I'm terrified of Mad yelling at me again.
"You know, I want to make a lot of people smile with this song, Onii-chan."
Shiona's words reached me as I hesitated.
"This song is orange... I'm sure it can turn the hearts of many people orange. Because it's a song that was created with the wish that it would. Because that's Onii-chan's wish. That's why I want many people to hear this song. And I want to make many people smile. That's my wish."
Shiona said as if talking to herself.
Those words pushed me forward.
I'll go to Mad's shop one more time tomorrow.
And I'll apologize again for breaking the clock.
With Shiona's singing and the music box, I strengthened my resolve.
The next day, I visited Mad's shop alone.
I can't count how many times I thought about turning back on the way.
Every time I thought that, Shiona's smile would flash through my mind.
I want to keep seeing that smile.
To do that, I want to fix the music box for her.
I recalled my resolve from yesterday over and over.
What I can do for Shiona.
I steeled myself and stepped into Mad's shop.
"What kind of face do you have coming here?"
Immediately after, Mad's voice, as low as distant thunder, rained down.
I wanted to run away immediately, but I didn't.
"I wanted to apologize more sincerely for yesterday."
"About the clock? You already apologized for that."
"Shiona was there at the time... I thought I should apologize properly, just me."
"I don't need that. Get out of here."
"I can't do that. I'm truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday."
"No matter how much you apologize, the clock is still broken. Get out."
"I'm sorry. I'm really sorry."
With my head bowed, I continued to apologize.
I wonder how much time had passed.
Eventually, Mad's voice, a little softer, reached me.
"...Raise your head."
As I did as I was told, Mad's face, looking somewhat exasperated, was there.
"Jeez... what a guy. You're persistent beyond belief."
"I'm sorry..."
"Don't apologize anymore, or I'll punch you!"
He said that, but there didn't seem to be as much anger as there was yesterday.
I thought I heard a small sigh.
"You're done here, right? Get out of here."
"Um... there's just one thing I wanted to ask."
"A request? You've got some nerve asking me for a favor."
The pressure made my legs tremble, but Shiona's words pushed me forward.
"That clock... could you let me have it?"
"...Say that again."
"Um... that clock from yesterday, could you let me have it--"
"ARE YOU KIDDING MEEEEEEEEEE?!"
The impact was like being struck by lightning, and I froze, standing perfectly still.
"You broke it yourself and now you want me to give it to you? Don't get carried away!"
It's no use... .
I can't take any more than this...
As I tried to run, a voice called out from behind.
"Please wait, Mad. Rei just wants to fix my brother's music box."
Shiona, who should have been waiting at home, was there.
Shiona, without being intimidated by Mad, stepped between him and me.
"My brother's music box is broken, and Rei said he'd fix it for me. He just needs the parts for that. He's truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday. So, won't you forgive him?"
Shiona told Mad with an unwavering smile.
"Hmm... hmmm..."
Mad's face was bright red, but his expression gradually softened.
"But, that clock is gone now. I threw that thing away. However..."
Mad turned his back to us, but continued to speak.
"I threw it away at the abandoned factory on the edge of town. I don't know what happened after that."
After saying only that, Mad sat down, facing the wall.
"Thank you, Mad."
Shiona bowed without losing her smile and left the store.
"Ah, thank you very much..."
I bowed in the same way and left the store.
"The abandoned factory is very close to where Rei collapsed."
Shiona told me as soon as we left the store.
"So, Shiona goes to throw away trash there?"
"That's right. Trash from all sorts of places gathers there."
"So, does he fix up things he finds there and sell them here?"
"That's right. Mad often goes to that place."
I see, that's why there were so many old things in the store.
He probably brings usable things from that place and reuses them.
In any case, I decided to head to that abandoned factory.
"Shiona, if you don't mind, I'd like you to guide me to that place."
"I'm sorry, the Red Children are supposed to come to my house today."
She must be talking about those kids who were talking to Shiona yesterday.
Come to think of it, she promised to treat them to soup.
"But Rei, you can't go alone, right? I'll go and cancel my promise with the children."
"No, it's okay, Shiona. You should keep your promise."
"But, how are you going to get there?"
"I'll try going to the library. I want to know more about this area, and I want to look at a map."
"The library..."
Shiona's expression seemed to cloud over slightly.
"Eh... no, it's nothing... Hey, Rei. Is Tippy-chan fond of you?"
"I wonder. I don't think she hates me, but why do you ask?"
"Oh, it's nothing. If it's the library, I'm sure there's a map. Goodbye."
"Yeah, I will. Well then, see you later."
I turned on my heel and started to head towards the library.
The smile I saw on Shiona's face at that moment seemed to hold some sadness, I thought.
But, I don't know the reason why.
"Rei, you came."
Tippy was in the same place as yesterday, shedding tears in the same way.
"Yeah, I came. Hey Tippy, can I ask you something?"
"Does this library have a map of the town?"
"Yeah, it does. It has lots of them."
"That's great. Will you guide me to where the maps are?"
"I will, but... but..."
Tippy was being somewhat hesitant.
"No, that's not it... that's not it, but..."
"Will you hold me?"
Tippy's face turned slightly red.
Her sad expression hasn't changed, but her cheeks seem a little softer.
"...Hold you? You mean, like I did yesterday?"
"Yeah... is it no good?"
"It's not no good. Here, come here."
"Yeah... yeah..."
When I opened my arms, Tippy stood up and jumped into my chest, somewhat hesitantly.
Unlike yesterday, it's a position where I'm holding her.
But, my thoughts are the same.
The Tippy I held was still small, soft, and seemed like she would break.
"Tippy, is this okay?"
"Yeah, it's okay. Rei... you're warm."
Tippy nuzzled my chest.
That gesture warmed the depths of my heart.
Could this be the emotion called love?
I want to protect this girl.
I want to stop these tears.
For a while, I held Tippy close.
"Um, can you walk over there like this?"
Tippy pointed her finger towards the aisle from within my arms.
Still holding her, I headed in the direction she indicated.
"Why do you need a map?"
"Apparently, there's an abandoned factory near the town. I want to go there."
"Why, to the abandoned factory?"
"Because, the parts I'm looking for might be there."
"The music box you were looking at yesterday?"
"Yeah, that's right. I really want to fix Shiona's brother's music box."
"Shiona's... I see. I hope you find it."
Still held in my arms, Tippy led me without hesitation to the bookshelf where the map books were kept.
"Do you remember where each book is, by any chance?"
"Yeah, mostly."
"That's amazing... Did someone teach you?"
"Nope. I learned by myself while waiting for Papa and Mama."
Tippy teared up a little when she said the words "Papa and Mama."
"Um... is it this one?"
I took out a map book to change the subject.
I sat down on the spot and opened the book.
Like the music box book, this map was also handwritten.
Could it be that all the books in this library are handwritten?
If that's the case, that's a considerable amount.
Just who could have handwritten this many books?
The task would take an endless amount of time, making me feel faint.
"It's pretty beat up... How old is this book?"
"Um... I don't know. It's a really, really, reeeeally old book."
It looked like a map from decades ago.
The buildings themselves seem to be the same as the current townscape, though...
The pages are badly faded, as if tea had been spilled on them.
Some of them were stuck together and looked like they would tear if I turned them.
I carefully turned the page.
"Ah, could this be it?"
I found a factory map symbol to the north of the town.
Judging by the direction of Shiona's house, there's a high probability this is the place.
"Rei... are you going? Don't go..."
Tippy clung to my neck.
I stroked her small back with my hand, over and over.
"It's okay, I'll come back."
"Really? Will you really come back again?"
"Yeah, of course. I promise."
"You promise? You absolutely, absolutely have to come back!"
"Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely!"
Again and again, I made promises with Tippy.
Why is that?
Even so, I hesitated to leave.
A feeling of wanting to stay by Tippy's side forever welled up inside me.
Hiding that feeling, I left the library.
Relying on the map, I entered the abandoned factory and was assaulted by the smell of oxidized oil.
This factory must have originally made Philoid arms and legs as well.
All around me, unfinished Philoid arm and leg parts were scattered everywhere.
All of them are before being covered with artificial skin, with the machine parts exposed.
Looking closely, I could see that they were made the same way as my right hand.
Even knowing they were artificial, the sight was bizarre.
To move a discarded arm, I pushed it away with my right hand.
The mournful sound of metal clashing echoed through the factory.
If, by some chance, any part of my body breaks, I can come here.
Here, there are mountains of replacement parts.
Deeper inside, there were many drums filled with oxidized oil.
Most of it was oxidized, but some of the oil was still unopened.
Even if I run out of oil, I can perform maintenance here without being seen.
The further I went into the factory, the more the worries I had in the back of my mind were resolved.
This abandoned factory should become an important place for me.
But, I can't find the most important thing.
That is, of course, the watch that Mad discarded in this place.
But, inside this factory, there isn't even anything that looks like trash, let alone a watch.
Could it be that the trash was thrown outside, not inside the factory?
I left the factory for a moment and decided to go around its perimeter.
Then, on the back side of the factory, I found an area piled high with machine parts.
There were machine parts, of course, but also a lot of trash.
Surely this town's garbage dump is here.
Besides Mad, there must be others who have taken things that could be useful from here.
Looking up at the mountain that was many times my height, I thought about that.
"...Now then, where could it be?"
There's a considerable amount of trash.
It would be difficult to find it by searching steadily.
But, there's no other way.
I immediately decided to start searching from my feet.
I don't know how long it took.
I had long since lost my sense of time.
Because I was moving muddy metal plates and containers covered in waste oil, my hands were covered in sludge.
My clothes were covered in oil, and before I knew it, there were a lot of stains.
After that, I crossed a carpet of garbage, swam in a river of filth, and was hit by a waterfall of scrap.
And then, I finally found it.
It was in Mad's shop.
The one I broke yesterday.
That watch.
I picked it up and stared intently at the hands on the face.
Of course, it's not moving.
I put it to my ear, but it didn't make a sound.
It's only natural since I broke it.
This watch will probably never tick again.
That fact pricked the depths of my heart slightly.
I gently embraced the watch and decided to start heading home.
Shiona will greet me kindly.
"I'm home. I found it."
When I held out the oil-stained trophy, Shiona smiled gently.
"Really, thank you. Here, get changed, get changed."
Shiona had prepared a towel and a change of clothes for me.
After wiping off the dirt and changing, I headed to the living room.
Shiona greeted me there as well.
"Ray, you look tired. Eat and rest."
"No, I'm okay. I want to get to work right away."
"Are you okay? I'm worried about your health, Ray."
"I'm fine. Strangely, I don't feel tired right now."
"But, you have to eat..."
"Yeah, I know. I'll eat later, so you go ahead and eat first."
"...Okay, I understand. Good luck."
Shiona leaves the living room.
I watched her go, and then I started working.
I opened the book I borrowed from the library beside me.
This music box has a mechanism where turning the handle causes various gears of different sizes inside to intricately mesh together, keeping the disc rotating at a constant speed.
Apparently, it's not like turning it faster makes the song play faster.
I thought that was a really amazing piece of technology.
Following the assembly instructions written in the book in reverse order, I disassembled the music box.
Then, as I compared the parts one by one to check if any were missing, I found that a gear in the power transmission section was broken.
So, even with something that moves with such precision, it only takes one small part to fail for it to stop working.
I couldn't help but look at my own right hand.
For now, I'll try to find a gear from the watch that's the same size as this broken one.
I then started disassembling the watch.
I removed the lid and used a screwdriver to remove the screws.
When I removed the cover, the internal structure was revealed.
Gears much more precise than those in the music box meshed together in multiple layers.
One of them, a slightly larger gear, had a broken axle. That's why the parts weren't turning.
I guess this is the place I broke yesterday.
The fact that Mad discarded this watch probably means he didn't have a gear of the same size.
Fortunately, the broken gear wasn't the size needed for the music box.
Disassembling things makes me feel somewhat hesitant.
Because I'm breaking this watch in order to fix the music box.
Perhaps it's because I understand what kind of existence I myself am.
Hesitantly, but as a small offering, I disassembled the watch as carefully as possible.
I lined up the watch gears on the table, starting with the smallest, and compared them to the ones from the music box.
"...Found it."
I was able to find a gear that seemed to be almost the same size.
Now, all that's left is to transplant this into the music box according to the book.
"I think this should work..."
With this, the disc should move without any problems.
I put the lid back on and turned the handle, and I felt some resistance.
But the handle won't turn any further than that.
I wonder why.
I reread the book.
The parts and the positions they're assembled in are all correct.
Tilting my head in confusion, I removed the lid again.
Then, I tried turning the handle as it was.
The gears were definitely meshing together perfectly.
But it seems the oil has completely dried up, probably because it hasn't been used in a while.
That must be the reason why the handle won't turn.
What should I do?
Should I go to Shiona and borrow some cooking oil?
...No, that's a problem too.
Cooking oil and gear lubricant are probably different types of oil.
It might work at first, but it could cause a breakdown.
If that's the case, what should I do...?
Suddenly, I looked at my right hand.
Although it's covered by a glove, underneath are exposed mechanical parts.
What about using the oil used in my hand?
I took off my glove and looked closely at my right hand.
Exposed mechanical parts.
Oil is built inside to smoothly move those parts.
I inserted a screwdriver into the palm near the base of my thumb.
When I removed the exterior, inside was a tightly packed mechanism of wires, cylinders, and shafts to move my mechanical hand.
One of the cylinders inside contained oil.
And it was detachable so that the old oil could be easily replaced.
I removed the cylinder with my left hand and dripped the oil that filled it onto the gears of the music box.
I spread the oil with my fingertip so that it would blend into all the gears as much as possible.
I wonder if it will work?
I returned the cylinder to my right hand and reattached the exterior.
Hiding my mechanical arm with the glove, I cautiously turned the handle as it was.
At first, it was awkward. But, as I turned the handle, the gears ran smoothly.
The oil must have circulated through all the gaps in the gears, and the handle continued to turn without any snagging.
And then, that melody begins to play.
"Rei, that song...!"
Shiona suddenly came into the room.
"Yeah. It's fixed, Shiona."
"Thank you... thank you, Rei. Thank you... I'm so, so happy."
Shiona showed me a smile I had never seen before.
Just looking at that smile, the depths of my heart warmed gently.
And then, I realized.
Ah, so this is it.
This is the emotion called happiness.
I am happy now.
I am happy to see Shiona's smile.
And, for the first time, I was able to feel a sense of being useful.
"Thank you, Rei, thank you."
Shiona took my hand and thanked me many times.
As her face drew closer, I felt my face grow hot.
"Thanks to Rei's hard work, the music box is fixed. I can listen to that song again, the one I had given up on. The orange-colored song that my brother made. This song that I love so much..."
"Hey, Shiona, sing it. Let me hear your brother's song."
"Yes... of course!"
I turn the handle of the music box.
Shiona clasped her hands in front of her chest and began to sing along with the melody.
The song she was singing when we met.
A song Shiona's brother made.
An orange-colored song.
I feel like I understand its meaning now.
The emotion dwelling in my heart is joy.
Shiona's song.
And Shiona, singing so happily.
Just watching her, my heart overflowed with joy.
More than usual, Shiona sang that song with such happiness.
That day, Shiona kept singing until she fell asleep.
I was also absorbed in her singing voice and the tone of the music box.
Over and over, Shiona asked me to play the song.
Until my arm could no longer move, Shiona kept singing.
Looking at her expression, I think.
I want to be with Shiona like this, forever.
If Shiona wishes for it, I can be with her forever.
But for that to happen, my true identity must never be revealed.
Never, absolutely never...
That day, I solidified my resolve to stay with Shiona forever.
Night, the room darkened.
On the two beds placed side-by-side, Shiona speaks to me.
"Will you listen to my request?"
"You see, I want many people to hear this song. And I want to make them smile. I want to make many people happy with this song that my brother made."
I only know the word.
But I don't understand what it is.
Is it a state of being?
Or is it an emotion?
I repeat the word 'happiness' over and over in my mind.
"So, I want you to help me."
"Help? How should I do that?"
"Tomorrow, I want you to go to the plaza with me. And I want you to play the music box."
"And then, Shiona will sing, right?"
"Yes, that's right. And I want as many people as possible to hear it. The orange-colored song that my brother made..."
"Yeah, I want to do that too. Of course, I'll help."
I heard the sound of the sheets rubbing together.
"What's wrong, Shiona?"
"Hey, Rei... can I hold your hand?"
I can't see Shiona's expression in the darkness.
But I feel like Shiona's face is turning red.
"My hand? With me?"
"Yeah, I want to hold Rei's hand... Is that... bad...?"
I search through my knowledge banks.
I know the act of holding hands.
But what it means for a boy and girl of our age...
"No, it's okay..."
If I'm being asked by a human... by Shiona, then I want to respond.
Fortunately, she's on my left side.
If it's the hand covered in artificial skin, then I don't think there'll be a problem.
I reach my hand over to the bed next to mine.
In the cold room, my outstretched hand felt a little chilly.
I search for Shiona's hand in the air.
I touch something, warmth.
Shiona's hand overlapped with mine.
"You're warm, Rei."
"Yeah... you're warm too, Shiona."
We held hands.
Without either of us initiating, our fingers intertwined.
It wasn't just the warmth coming from our hands, a different kind of warmth was spreading.
Is this the warmth of a human, different from my artificial warmth...?
"Rei... tighter, please."
"...Like this...?"
"Sorry, was that too hard?"
"No... it was just stronger than I expected."
"Is this strength okay?"
"Yeah... thank you, Rei."
We held hands all night long.
Until the morning woke us up, our hands remained connected.
The next day, the plaza was overflowing with sound.
The melody that Shiona and I began to play.
Shiona sang.
And I turned Shiona's older brother's music box.
At first, there wasn't a single person passing by.
But as if drawn in by Shiona's singing voice, the number of people increased.
One person, then two, stopped in their tracks, and soon a small circle formed.
That circle quickly grew larger, and the deserted plaza was soon bustling with activity.
Everyone there was listening intently to Shiona's singing voice.
A young couple leaned close to each other, holding each other's hands.
An old man closed his eyes, deeply moved.
A young man gazed at a woman standing a little ways away.
A young parent and child laughed joyfully together.
The children were moving their bodies to the rhythm of the song.
Each of them was listening to Shiona's song with their own thoughts and feelings.
But there was one thing they all had in common.
And that was that everyone was 'smiling'.
Listening to Shiona's song, everyone was breaking into a smile.
Feeling that I was now cooperating in bringing smiles to the faces of the people in this place, I felt a warmth deep in my heart.
This is the emotion called happiness.
The emotion I felt yesterday when I saw Shiona's smile.
This is what it was, huh.
I'm happy.
I felt my cheeks lift slightly.
I'm sure I'm smiling too.
It might be a slightly awkward-looking smile.
But that's okay.
If I can get even a little closer to Shiona, I'll be satisfied with just that.
The music box, which I had just repaired, continued to play the melody without a hitch.
The handle I turn is also in good condition.
The sound flowing from the disc resonates and amplifies inside the wooden box, emerging as a clear tone.
According to Shiona, it's an orange-colored melody.
And to that melody, Shiona sings.
I wished this moment could last forever and ever.
This time where we can bring smiles to people's faces.
And I wanted to keep watching Shiona's happy profile as she sang, forever and ever.
Suddenly, my gaze drifted towards the library on the edge of town.
I thought I saw the closed curtains sway slightly.
For a moment, I even saw a small figure.
I know who it is.
That blue-haired girl who's always crying.
It's Tipi.
She's probably still crying right now.
In that lonely library--.
Just thinking about it made a small ache in my chest.
It felt like a thorn had pricked me.
What must Tipi be thinking as she watches this circle?
This ever-expanding circle of smiles.
Everyone there was smiling and sharing the same feeling.
I noticed that there was one person with a scowl on their face.
That person with his shoulders squared and arms crossed is Mad.
He was so out of place, the only one with 'anger' written all over his face.
I suddenly met Mad's eyes, eyes that held an emotion I didn't yet know.
It was a time shorter than a second.
Mad harrumphed, turned on his heel, and disappeared into the crowd.
Watching him go, I thought.
I want to make everyone smile.
Those two expressing sadness and anger.
I want to make Tipi and Mad smile.
But, what should I do?
While turning the handle of the music box, I kept thinking about such things.
After the song ended, I headed to Mad's shop alone.
I couldn't shake the scowl he had on his face back then.
I cautiously stepped into the shop, which was as dim and eerie as ever.
There weren't any customers.
Only Mad was sitting in the chair at the register.
However, something was off.
Unlike before, he wasn't leaning back in his chair.
He was just staring intently at what looked like a small, rectangular chip in his hand.
His expression was still stern, but there was also a hint of loneliness about him.
"Um... Mad-san?"
When I called out to him, Mad hurriedly hid the chip in his palm.
"O-oh, what do you want? Why did you come in here without permission?"
"Without permission? It's a shop, so isn't it free to enter...?"
"Don't be ridiculous! You're an insolent brat to enter my shop without my permission!!"
I'm being told something very unreasonable.
"But, for Mad-san to not notice me coming in, you must have been really focused on that chip."
"I'm talking about the chip you're hiding in your palm."
"I'm not hiding anything!!"
"But I saw you. If you say you're not hiding it, then open your palm and show me what's in it--"
"Shut up and get out! And don't ever come back againnnnn!!"
As if pushed out by his words, I was kicked out of Mad's shop.
I came here to make Mad-san smile, but I'm doing the complete opposite.
Shiona was waiting for me in front of the shop.
Her smile warmed the depths of my heart a little.
"Huh? Why is Shiona here?"
"I was worried about where Rei was going, so I followed you."
"I came here to try and make Mad-san smile. But I just made him angry again..."
"Make Mad-san smile...? That's a very difficult thing to do. So don't worry about it. Mad-san getting angry is just a normal occurrence."
"But, today he seemed angrier than usual."
"More than usual? Did something happen?"
"I don't really know, but I asked him about the chip."
"...Chip?"
"Yeah, it was a square chip, small enough to fit in your palm. Mad-san was staring intently at it..."
I used my fingers to show Shiona the size of the chip that Mad-san was holding.
Shiona's eyes widened slightly, as if she knew something about the chip.
"Could it be that you asked him about that chip?"
"That's right. Then, he suddenly got angry--"
"Yeah, yeah, I see. Rei, it can't be helped."
"Can't be helped? What do you mean?"
"That chip is Mad-san's treasure."
"Mad-san's treasure? What's inside it?"
"It should contain a movie that Mad-san's son made."
"His son's movie? Is Mad-san's son a movie director?"
"Yes, he is. Although, he left this town a long time ago and hasn't come back since."
Shiona said, while looking towards the shop.
A strange expression, a mix of two emotions...troubled, but still with an unbroken smile.
"But, why is he just staring at the chip? He should just watch the movie."
"That's impossible. There's no equipment in this town that can play that chip."
"So, Mad-san is staring at it like that because he wants to see it but can't?"
"I'm sure that's it. He's shy, so he won't say it out loud, though."
At that moment, I had an idea.
A way to make Mad-san, who always has a scowl and is always angry, smile.
“No, it’s nothing. Shiona, I want to stop somewhere, so go on back.”
“Stop somewhere...?”
“Yeah, there's something I want to look into.”
“...The library?”
I thought Shiona looked a little surprised.
I wonder if she's worried about me, since I'm not used to the town yet.
“I definitely won’t be late.”
I said clearly, trying to ease Shiona's worries.
Shiona opened her mouth as if to say something, but closed it immediately.
And once. She bit her lip lightly for just a moment, then smiled.
“...Okay. Be careful, Rei.”
I parted ways with Shiona in front of Mad-san's shop and started walking through the town alone.
The inside of the library was as dim as ever, and the air was stagnant.
I headed straight through the maze-like interior without hesitation.
To the blue girl who is always crying--.
“Rei, you came.”
Tipi ran up to me as soon as she saw me.
I gently held her small body.
“Yeah, because I promised.”
“Thank you, Rei. I’m so happy.”
Tipi has her face buried in my stomach.
I could feel her tears soaking through my clothes.
“Tipi, what were you doing?”
“Drawing a picture. Come here, Rei.”
Taking my hand, Tipi led me along.
Where Tipi had been sitting, there were drawing papers and crayons scattered around.
In the middle of them was a half-finished drawing.
“Did you draw this, Tipi?”
“Yeah. I draw one every day.”
Tipi said, and then resumed drawing.
I peered into the picture.
There was a picture of a singing girl and a boy turning a music box.
“Tipi, could this be…”
“It’s Rei and Shiona. Singing in the plaza.”
So Tipi was watching us through the curtains after all.
Thinking of Tipi watching us all alone, for some reason, my chest ached.
“Rei, what’s wrong? Are you feeling bad somewhere?”
The eyes of the girl looking up at me were full of sorrow.
I placed my hand on Tipi's head, as if to comfort that emotion.
“I’m okay, it’s nothing. It’s a very good picture.”
“Yeah… thank you, I’m happy.”
When I pat her head, Tipi nuzzles up to me affectionately.
But her face is fragile, and sad--.
I truly wanted to see this child smile from the bottom of my heart.
“You said you draw one picture every day, but are there other pictures too?”
“Yeah, there are. Rei, come here.”
Tipi stood up, took my hand, and led me deeper into the library.
There, the pictures were.
Tipi must have put them up herself; several pictures were pasted on the wall in a low position.
“This is the picture I drew yesterday, this is the day before that, this is the day before that…”
Tipi explained each one to me.
A picture of a girl holding hands with a young man, looking happy.
A young man and another girl visiting the girl.
And then, a picture of a girl crying alone.
Ah, I see.
This is Tipi's picture diary.
From then on, there were pictures of a girl continuing to cry alone.
Since I came here, Tipi hasn't been alone anymore.
The expression on the girl in the picture seemed to have softened a little.
Surely that is Tipi's own emotion.
But it was still nothing more than something pregnant with sadness.
I wanted to make this girl smile too.
What can I do for that?
I can't think of an answer.
The only thing I can say is that I'll stay by Tipi's side like this.
“Hey Rei, what kind of book did you come to find today?”
Tipi, still with a sad look on her face, tugged at my sleeve and looked up at me.
“I'm looking for a device that can project images... do you know if there's a book about that?”
“Yeah, there is. It's a little far from here, though.”
“Will you guide me?”
“Yeah, okay. Here!”
And with that, Tipi spread her arms wide.
The bear plushie in her right hand dangled in the air.
“Carry me.”
I picked Tipi up.
Just like before, she rubbed her cheek against my chest.
“It's that way, Rei.”
And so, I began to follow her to the book I was looking for.
The book was on the second floor of the library--.
A corner of the shelf where materials related to images from all over the world, such as projectors and projection machines, were gathered.
“The book you want to read is definitely here.”
The books lined up on the shelf were all handwritten, just like the music box books and maps.
However, there seemed to be quite a few types of projectors, some using film and others using discs.
“What kind are you looking for?”
“I’m looking for something that can project a chip about this size, do you know?”
I used my fingers to show her the size of the chip that Mad had.
“Hmm… a square? Or a square with only one corner missing?”
“The corners… it felt like they were missing diagonally… I think.”
I hadn't looked at it very closely, so I couldn't say for sure.
But Tipi nodded slightly.
“That shape, is it Mad’s chip?”
“Yeah, it’s the chip Mad had.”
I was surprised that Tipi knew about Mad, but he was the owner of the general store in this town, so there was nothing strange about it.
Shiona knew about Mad's chip too, and maybe everyone in town knew.
And the fact that Mad was stubborn and wouldn't let anyone see what was inside was probably common knowledge.
“Um, well… if it’s that… then… this.”
Standing on her tiptoes, Tipi pointed to a book on the shelf that was just barely within reach.
“That’s amazing, Tipi. You really do remember the location of all the books, don’t you?”
“Ehehe~. I got praised~”
Tipi pressed her face against my stomach.
While patting her head, I picked up the book and checked its contents.
It was more like an instruction manual than a book.
“Mume Company Projector” – the types of reproducible media and chips were written in detail.
The internal structure and wiring were also carefully noted.
It seemed to be a projection-type player that could project content recorded on portable chips onto a screen or white wall.
If I could find this device, I could show Mad the movie inside the chip.
“Thank you, Tipi, I found the information I wanted.”
“…Are you leaving already?”
Tipi looked up at me with a sad expression.
“…Yeah, sorry.”
“Nooo~. Don’t go.”
Perhaps she intended to stop me from leaving.
Tipi hugged me.
That innocent warmth shook my resolve.
But I have to go.
Because right now, I want to make Mad happy.
Because I want to see Mad’s smile.
“Tipi, I promise. I’ll definitely come again tomorrow.”
“Tomorrow…? Really…?”
“Yeah, really. I promise.”
"...You won't disappear?"
"Yeah, I won't disappear. I'll come to see you every day, without fail."
"...Okay. I'll be waiting."
With lingering reluctance, I left the blue-haired girl—Tipi—behind and exited the library.
"You came back! What did you come here for!!!"
As soon as I entered the shop, Mad's roar greeted me.
I want to run away.
I want to cover my ears.
But, I didn't.
Because I wanted to fulfill Mad's wish.
"Mad-san, I have a request. Please lend me your son's chip."
"The chip that has your son's movie on it."
"Why should I lend it to you? Don't be ridiculous!!"
"Please... please."
"Enough with your meddling! It's a nuisance!"
"I... I want to be helpful to you, Mad-san!!"
"Helpful, you say?"
Mad's gaze sharpened even further, and a feeling of terror began to take hold, constricting my throat.
The movable parts of my knees lost their strength, and I felt a floating sensation.
I want to run away right now... but I can't hesitate here.
"I heard about the chip from Shiona. That your son left town to become a movie director. And that movie was sent from your son, right? But you couldn't watch it because you didn't have a playback device, am I wrong?"
I spoke quickly, trying to suppress my fear.
Perhaps taken aback by my momentum, Mad-san looked at me with a slightly surprised expression.
"I just went to the library. To find out what kind of device is needed to play it."
"You... you went to the library...?"
At the word 'library,' Mad-san looked even more surprised.
"Yes... I'll find a device that can play that chip. If the player is broken, I'll fix it. If I can't find one, I'll even build one by piecing together various parts."
"Why would you go so far? It's none of your business."
"It may be true that it's none of my business. But it's what I want to do."
"I want to be helpful to you, Mad-san... that's all. So, please."
Silence ensued.
Was this a silence of affirmation, or—.
"That guy was the worst, a complete idiot for a son."
Mad-san sat down in his chair and looked up at the ceiling.
Then, with a somewhat sad expression, he began to tell me his story.
All we ever did was fight.
Every time we saw each other, a fight would start.
So, at some point, he started avoiding me.
No, maybe I was the one who was avoiding him.
Anyway, we stopped seeing each other as much.
So when he came to me and said he had something to talk about, I was surprised.
“I’m leaving this town.”
“Leaving town? What are you talking about?”
“I’m leaving this town to become a movie director. I realized, I really love movies.”
“Stop talking about dreams and face reality. There’s no way someone like you can be a director. You can’t do it.”
“Don’t just assume it’s impossible! You won’t know unless you try!”
“I know. I’m your father. No one will watch a movie by a director without talent.”
“There are people who recognize me! I’ve been getting results! You’re just the only one who won’t acknowledge it!”
“I can’t even dream in a town like this!”
“A town like this? Say that again.”
“I’ll say it as many times as you want. I can’t stand a life where I spend my whole life in a town like this, in a shop like this.”
“You… enough…”
“I’ll say it as many times as I want! You’re just afraid of changing!”
“Ever since Mom died, you’ve been doing the same thing every day--”
Without thinking, I hit him.
“...That’s right, you always resort to violence. I’ve had enough.”
“...I see. Get out.”
“Yeah, I will. Keep doing the same thing here forever.”
My son left home.
And since then, he hasn’t even sent a single message.
The only thing he sent was this movie on this chip.
How am I supposed to watch it when I don’t have a device to play it on?
I can’t forgive him for being so selfish.
I don’t want to watch a movie like this.
I especially don’t want to see his face.
I was surprised at how unusually talkative Mad was.
The more I heard his feelings, the more my own feelings grew.
If Mad really hated his son, he wouldn’t keep a chip he couldn’t play all this time.
If his son hated Mad, he wouldn’t have sent him the movie he made.
I’m sure he wants Mad to see this movie.
I think he sent that chip to Mad with some kind of feeling.
That’s why I want to show this movie to Mad.
I bowed my head again.
“Please! Lend me the chip!”
Mad came in front of me in silence.
I was prepared to be yelled at, but I no longer felt fear.
More than that, my desire to be helpful to Mad was stronger.
But Mad handed me the chip he was holding.
“Do whatever you want.”
I stared at the chip I received once more.
It was a metal core covered in organic glass, with iridescent electronic circuits running through it.
I knew what it was. A general-purpose chip also used for Phyllod's memory backup.
It had become a global standard, and most manufacturers had adopted this format.
If that's the case, it might be playable even without a Mume Corporation projector.
I clenched the chip and bowed my head towards Mad.
A deserted factory on the edge of town.
I had set foot in a mountain of garbage behind it.
I thought that if there was any device to play Mad's chip, it would be in this abandoned factory.
If it were in town, he would have already played it.
There was a lot of equipment mixed in with the garbage.
Things with broken wiring, things that had rusted.
As far as I could see, it was all unusable.
The possibility of finding the projector itself in this place is low. But I think I can find some parts, like circuit boards.
That's right, just like I told Mad, I'll connect the parts and assemble something that can play the chip.
This is the only place I can rely on.
If I don't do something here, Mad will remain with that expression forever.
I won't let that happen.
I don't want that to happen.
With only that in mind, I began to dismantle the scrap heap.
But no matter how much I searched, I couldn't find the device I was looking for.
I'm sure Mad must have searched for one before.
No... maybe, Mad is still searching even now.
Shiona said that Mad fixes things he finds in this junkyard and sells them at the general store.
I wonder if his real goal was to find a projector to play his son's chip.
If that's the case, how must Mad feel, having been unable to find it all this time...?
Picking up something else in place of the projector... what was he thinking when he was repairing it...?
I broke Mad's clock.
Ah... I see... so that's why Mad was angry.
That clock was a part of the process for Mad to try and retrieve something important to him.
This is just speculation. But, I want to believe that's the case.
If that's true, then I won't be able to easily find what Mad has been searching for all this time.
Even so, I won't give up.
Finding the projector would be the greatest atonement I could offer Mad for breaking his clock...
It was when I dragged a piece of equipment larger than my body.
I felt a strange sensation in my right hand.
A very slight discomfort... I feel a stiffness in the movement of the joints in my fingers.
Has the oil run out, or has something broken down?
If I continue working like this, it might not be good.
I couldn't stop moving my hands.
Mad must have searched everywhere within my reach.
I look up at the mountain of scrap metal piled far higher than my own height.
Since I weigh less than Mad, maybe I can climb it.
Thinking that, I immediately started climbing the unkempt, awkward stairs.
I could feel water hitting my back.
Large raindrops were pouring down from the sky I looked up at.
"Rei, let's stop now."
A voice came from a position lower than my feet.
When I turned around, Shiona was there.
She was looking up at me, getting wet in the rain.
"It's raining. You'll catch a cold if you stay like this."
"I'm okay, I'll look a little more, thanks."
"Even if you don't find it, Mad will be happy that you tried so hard."
"I'm okay, Shiona. Just a little more."
I continued working.
From behind me, Shiona spoke to me unilaterally.
"But, you're already soaking wet. Let's stop. You're tired, aren't you? No one will blame you for giving up, Rei."
As if to soothe me.
"I'm worried about your body, let's stop, okay? I'll be sad if you get hurt, Rei... Giving up is also important."
"There might be other ways, so let's go home for today. I'm preparing orange fluffy soup."
"Let's go home... Rei, let's go home... hey, Rei... I'm worried, Rei..."
Even so, I continued.
Undaunted by the pouring rain, I kept searching.
I pulled out a rusted sheet of iron.
The moment I did, a small avalanche of scrap metal occurred.
I retreated, dodging the scrap metal that came crashing down at my feet with a deafening roar.
"Look out, Rei!"
I turned around at Shiona's voice, and a mountain of scrap metal cascading down from behind me came into view.
The mountain piled up behind me was also collapsing in the same way.
While almost being swallowed up, I somehow ran up the collapsing scrap.
After a while, the avalanche subsided, and only the sound of rain remained in the area once more.
"Are you okay, Rei? Are you hurt?"
"Yeah, somehow... That was close."
"Really... I'm glad you're safe, so glad..."
Shiona let out a sigh of relief.
As if to prove I was unharmed, I stood up.
"Ah... Rei, that."
Shiona pointed at my feet with wide eyes.
The mountain of scrap that had collapsed earlier. Within it, there was a piece of equipment I recognized.
It was the same equipment that was in the book Tippy had shown me.
I dug it out, and when I looked at the surface of the device, it had the faded letters 'Mume' written on it.
"I found it... Shiona, this is it! I found it!"
I lifted it up high so Shiona could see it.
The water that had accumulated inside flowed out as I tilted it.
"I did it, Shiona! I finally found it! Now Mad-san will be able to watch movies!"
"Yeah, but... I think that machine is broken...?"
"Huh?"
Shiona said that, and I brought the hand holding the device in front of my eyes.
Indeed, the device I found—'a Mume-brand projector'—had obvious signs of damage.
The lens needed for projection was missing.
Also, there was a large crack on the top, and when I peeked inside, the internal circuitry was covered in rust.
With this, it's impossible to project a movie.
"That's too bad... Rei, shall we go home now?"
Shiona offered her hand.
I placed my hand over hers.
Its warmth warmed my rain-chilled hand.
By the time we returned to town, the rain had stopped.
But the inside of my heart didn't clear up.
Can I really repair the projector I'm holding in my arms?
In my heart, I was determined to fix it, but now that I've witnessed how battered it is, that resolve wavers.
"What's wrong, getting all soaked like that?"
On the way back to the church, I was suddenly called out to.
When I turned around, the photography studio manager who had taken our picture before was standing there.
I was just looking for something.
Looking for something...? I see. So, did you find what you were looking for?
Yes... but...
Is something the matter?
We found it, but it's broken and unusable.
Shiona answered for me, as I was feeling dejected.
I see. That's too bad. By the way, what were you planning to use it for?
Actually... I wanted to play the chip that Mad-san has.
Mad-san's? The chip that was sent from his son, right?
...Yes. I wanted to make Mad-san, who's always angry, happy...
Is that something you truly want to do from the bottom of your heart?
The manager asked gently, yet probing.
Yes, of course.
I answered without hesitation.
Mad-san... always has an angry face and looks like he's in so much pain. I think if there's some kind of trigger, he'll smile. I think people can be happy if they can laugh. And I think other people who see that can be happy too.
After saying that much, I looked at Shiona.
I... learned that from Shiona.
Shiona looked surprised at my words, but quickly smiled.
Yes, that's the expression. Someone's smile makes the people around them feel happy too.
The moment Shiona smiled at me, my heart warmed up as well.
I see... could you show it to me?
The manager pointed at the projector I was holding. I silently handed over the broken device.
The photography studio manager carefully examined the device.
I see, this is terrible. There are too many missing parts to even try to fix it.
Hearing that from the manager, who always takes care of his cameras, made me feel discouraged.
Perhaps noticing my dejected mood, the manager returned the projector with a wry smile.
Let's go home soon, Rei? You'll catch a cold.
That's right. Staying wet in the rain is bad for your health. You should probably go home and change.
Any more than this and we'll just be bothering the manager.
Even if I'm okay, Shiona, being human, could catch a cold.
Hugging the projector, I bowed to the manager and we headed towards the church.
When we returned to the church, Shiona wiped my head with a fluffy towel.
Gently, softly, dabbing carefully so as not to rub.
That's too bad about the projector, huh?
...Yeah, but that place was originally a garbage dump, so it's only natural that it was broken.
Something I should have realized if I had thought about it a little. But I was hoping for a convenient turn of events.
That if I wished for it, something would happen. That if I worked hard, results would surely follow.
I'm reminded that reality isn't that sweet.
It can't be helped. You did your best, Rei, no one will complain.
But... but I wanted to show Mad the movie.
Yeah... Rei, you're so kind.
It's not kindness or anything like that. I just think it's my role.
But just that feeling alone will make Mad happy. That's enough.
I hope so...
For now, let's warm up, okay? I'll get you something to drink that'll warm you up, body and soul.
Folding the towel she used to wipe my head, Shiona smiled and headed towards the kitchen.
I sat down on a chair and sighed.
I look at the broken projector on the table.
...No, there's no point in being down.
Even though it's broken, if you think about it, we've made some progress from having nothing.
If I fix this projector little by little, I should be able to play the chip someday.
The book I borrowed from Tipi has instructions on how to disassemble it for maintenance.
If I unravel it in order, I should be able to fix it.
I can look for the missing parts one by one at that factory.
I want to see Mad smile. I want to see an expression of joy, like Shiona's when the music box was fixed.
I renew my resolve to fix the projector.
Just then, I notice that the church's main hall is getting lively.
Excuse me.
Opening the door and peeking out, I saw the photography studio manager.
And behind him, even more people from town.
What's going on?
I asked, puzzled, and the townspeople smiled as they offered me something.
This is a part from our broken clock. I thought it might be useful.
I thought this wiring might fit.
Use my light!
No, use mine!
We have plenty of tools at our place, so use as many as you need.
Various electrical components, wiring equipment, electronic circuits, gears, and screws were placed on the table one after another.
Unable to understand the scene, I was dumbfounded, and the manager smiled kindly.
...Um, what is this?
You're going to fix that projector, right? When I told everyone, they brought things that they thought might be useful. There might be some unnecessary things, but it's better to have materials than not, right?
But why...?
Everyone was moved by your and Shiona's music and song. They really wanted to thank you. ...I'm one of them too.
The manager took out a lens and handed it to me.
This... It's a camera lens, I wonder if it will fit?
I felt something warm deep inside my chest.
And that warmth gradually welled up, higher and higher.
Eventually, that warmth reached the depths of my eyes, becoming hotter and hotter.
The words wouldn't come together properly in my head. I wanted to say something, but only my lips trembled.
Shiona, holding a steaming cup, was watching me gently as I was in such a state.
Shiona... I feel warmth deep inside my chest. I wonder why.
Rei, that's an emotion called 'joy'.
As she said that, she approached me and handed me a cup filled with a drink that had a heart-warming aroma.
Everyone is responding to your desire to make Mad smile, Rei. Everyone is thinking about making Mad happy, with you at the center.
I wonder if I'm not being a bother... even though I started this on my own.
If they thought you were a bother, they wouldn't have such warm smiles on their faces.
I looked at the townspeople who had brought the parts, one by one.
Each of them held their respective parts, held them up so I could see them, and smiled at me.
...Thank you, everyone.
Using the parts and tools I received, I started the repairs on the spot.
I proceeded with the help of various people in areas that I couldn't understand on my own.
I removed the moisture, carefully scraped off the rusted parts with a file, and repaired the broken electronic circuits with copper foil.
I used the tip of a screwdriver heated until it turned red to correct the solder that was about to come off.
No, no, it's not like that, it's like this!
No, no, it should be like this!
You're both wrong! It's definitely like this here!
No, it's not like that, it's like this.
Noisily, but cheerfully, the repairs were carried out by everyone.
And then, finally...
The repairs were finished, in a patchwork, clumsy state.
Thank you, everyone.
It's nothing. But in return, let us hear that song again.
The children love it. Please do it again.
Listening to it with my boyfriend really sets the mood.
Listening to that song... it reminds me of the old days...
I love that song, it's so much fun!
A clumsy device made by everyone.
It looked nothing like the ones I'd seen in books.
But it was a one-of-a-kind projector, made by everyone.
I felt more joy than I ever had before.
Everyone there was genuinely happy about its completion.
All that's left is to test it out.
Hearing the words 'test run,' I looked around the room.
Come to think of it, I've never seen electricity in this town.
The photographer was using an analog camera, too.
...Um, is it possible that this town doesn't have electricity...?
At my question, everyone in the room suddenly looked startled.
It was an awkwardness, like I'd touched on something I shouldn't have.
Even the director, who proposed the test startup, had fallen silent.
“It’s a library, you know,”
Shiona said, breaking the awkward silence.
“This town doesn’t have electricity, but the storage facility is still intact.”
“That’s the library?”
“Yeah, that’s right.”
It was as if a ray of hope had shone through.
I felt my cheeks soften.
But Shiona's expression—even though she was smiling, her eyes looked somewhat sad.
The next day, I went to the library with Shiona.
Carrying the handmade projector we made with the townspeople yesterday.
“I didn’t know there was a device like this here.”
Installed at the library counter was a device that could store electricity made using sunlight in portable batteries.
Apparently, it's the only device left in this town.
However, due to the aging of the solar panels, it's not capable of generating a large amount of electricity.
For this town, electrical energy is a precious commodity.
Despite my selfishness, everyone in town permitted me to use such a valuable thing.
They always said, “If you play music for us again.”
However, there was something that I couldn't help but be concerned about.
I had a feeling that the library held some special meaning for the people of this town.
Yesterday's reaction from everyone... Thinking back, even Mad-san's expression changed when I went to the library.
...No, I shouldn't make strange assumptions now.
I averted my gaze from the charging battery and looked at Shiona, trying to hide the anxiety in my heart.
"I'll have to have Shiona sing again."
"Yeah, I'll sing with a feeling of gratitude to everyone."
Shiona gives me her usual smile.
Next to Shiona was Tipi.
She was looking at Shiona with a slightly bewildered expression.
Come to think of it, this is the first time I've seen these two standing side by side.
"Tipi, how long do you think it will take to charge?"
"Umm... probably about thirty minutes more, I think."
"I see, that's surprisingly fast."
"Only thirty more minutes to be with Rei...?"
Tipi makes a wide detour around Shiona and hugs my leg.
Her sad expression hasn't changed.
But I felt that her sadness had eased just a little.
I stroked Tipi's head with the palm of my hand.
As I stroked her silky hair over and over, Tipi rubbed her cheek against my leg.
"...Alright, you two. That's enough."
Shiona wedges herself between me and Tipi.
"Ah... Rei, Rei..."
Tipi reaches out her hand, seeking me.
But her hand doesn't reach me.
"Rei, just a minute..."
Shiona grabs my arm and drags me to the wall.
--Shiona's sweet scent tickled my nose.
"Rei, Tipi-chan is a girl now. Do you understand what that means?"
"I know. She's affectionate and cute, isn't she?"
"That's not what I mean... I don't think it's good to touch her so casually or get too friendly with her."
"Why? I think it's fine if Tipi is happy."
"That's not it... I don't think it's good to touch a girl of her age so casually."
"Even if she's of age, Tipi is still a child, right?"
"Girls mature on the inside faster than they look. She already has a pink heart."
"Pink...? What does that mean?"
"Pink is pink. That's why I don't think it's good."
Shiona seemed more flustered than usual.
She was talking to me with a smile, but her cheeks were slightly puffed out.
Come to think of it, whenever I said I was going to the library, her smile always stiffened.
It seems Shiona doesn't really like me getting along with Tipi.
Even now, it looks like she's competing with Tipi.
"...Hey, Shiona. Could it be that what you're feeling is... 'jealousy'?"
At my words, Shiona's eyes widened and she gasped.
She shifted her gaze restlessly, avoiding looking at me.
It's an expression I've never seen her make before, she who always has a smile on her face.
I reach out my hand to Shiona's head.
"Eh? Rei...?"
And then, I gently stroked her hair, just like I do with Tipi.
"W-Wha, Rei, what's with you all of a sudden? What's wrong?"
Shiona's hair was different from Tipi's, smooth and pleasant to the touch. A nice scent wafted up every time I stroked it.
It was the kind of hair that made you want to touch it forever.
"R-Rei? I feel kind of embarrassed, okay?"
"Ah, sorry. But, I somehow thought this might be a good thing to do."
I don't really understand it, but looking at Shiona now makes my chest feel warm.
A sensation close to the joy I learned about before is welling up.
"S-So, anyway, let's try to refrain from getting too clingy, okay? Promise me?"
"Yeah, if that's what Shiona says, then I will."
That's all I could say.
We return to Tipi's side.
Tipi looked up at us anxiously.
"What's wrong? Is Tipi a bad girl? Is that why you're both angry?"
Tipi furrows her brow sadly.
"It's okay. It's nothing."
"Really? Really, really not angry? Because Shiona's face... is red?"
"T-This is, it's different, okay? I'm not red and prickly!"
"Hmm... Okay, I understand."
Tipi shed tears of relief.
In truth, I want to wipe away those tears with my fingertips, but Shiona would surely dislike that.
So I decided to suppress that impulse.
I turn on the projector, which has finished charging.
A low motor sound whirs, and the exhaust fan starts to spin.
A light at the top, indicating that it is preparing to start, is flashing.
It's been a while since I've seen electric light. Me, Shiona, and Tipi all stared at the flashing light with eyes of wonder.
"Um... where do I insert the chip..."
The control panel on the side of the projector has a broken and exposed lid.
In the center of it, there is a slot for inserting the chip.
I slowly inserted the chip I received from Mad.
The projector flashed a red light busily as it tried to read the data inside.
We watched the process with bated breath.
After about ten seconds, the flashing interval of the lamp shortened--and changed to a green light.
"This... means it's okay, right?"
Anxiety and excitement mixed within me, and my voice was strained.
Yeah, it means the projector is fixed and the data inside is okay.
Shiona's words made my heart soar. I could feel the corners of my mouth naturally turning upward.
I felt a sense of "joy" at the satisfaction of accomplishing something new.
Having finished charging the projector and confirming its operation, we were on our way to Mad's shop.
Tipi said she was getting sleepy and stayed behind at the library.
I wanted her to see it with us, but Shiona scolded me, saying I shouldn't push her too hard.
"I wonder if Mad will be happy."
"Y-Yeah... I'm sure he'll be happy."
"I hope so. It's something everyone in town made together. All the more so because everyone's feelings are in it."
"Y-Yeah... that's right."
"What's wrong, Shiona? Is something the matter?"
Shiona has been acting distant since a while ago.
"N-Nothing. Nothing at all."
"Is that so... I feel like something's different..."
"More than that, Rei, it's cloudier than usual today, and my heart is turning gray."
Shiona muttered as she looked up at the sky.
I looked up at the sky in the same way, but I couldn't tell the difference from usual.
Rather, since it rained, the dust in the atmosphere has been cleared away, and I feel somewhat easier to breathe.
"And it's humid, so I feel all bumpy inside. So, Rei, why don't we relax at home today? Let's get fluffy with orange soup."
I wonder if this air is making Shiona uncomfortable...?
No, I think Shiona's words are probably hiding what she really wants to say.
But I didn't really understand what that meant.
I can't imagine Shiona being mean.
But, we went to the trouble of making it together. I want to show Mad his son's movie soon.
I see... You're right.
Shiona fell silent after that.
She's not angry.
She's keeping pace with me, walking alongside me.
But I could see a shadow in her expression.
We arrived at Mad's shop and stepped inside the dimly lit interior.
Hey... what do you think you're doing, barging in here?
Mad's booming voice echoed from the back of the shop.
He was leaning back in his chair, staring straight at us.
Hello, Mad. Um... this.
I took out the patched-up projector.
Mad glared at it as if he were sizing it up.
What's that? We don't buy garbage here.
That's not it. It looks bad, but this is a projector that can play your son's movie.
My son's movie? I don't remember asking anyone to make something like that.
I know you didn't ask me to. I did it on my own. But, lots of people in town helped me make this. I want Mad to see the movie with everyone.
Like I said, I don't remember asking you to do any of that.
I understand. I did it on my own. So what I'm about to do now, I'm also doing on my own. Stop me if you want to.
I started to walk forward.
But from behind, Shiona tugged on my sleeve, stopping me.
Rei, Mad's being prickly and purple... maybe you should stop for today. How about we try another day?
Shiona, we've come this far. Mad may say that, but he must want to see his son's movie. If we don't watch it here, he'll probably never see it.
Besides, if he really hated it, I'd already be thrown outside.
It's just a guess based on Mad's past behavior, but I don't think I'm wrong.
It's okay, Shiona. So don't look so worried. It's going to be alright.
I nodded firmly, trying to dispel Shiona's anxiety.
…Okay, Rei. If that's what you want to do, then do as you please.
Shiona let go of my sleeve.
I started walking again.
I placed the equipment on the register counter and closed the shop door.
Next, I closed all the window curtains.
The already dark shop became even darker.
It was just the right darkness for playing a movie.
Then, I turned on the projector, which I had just charged. The fan whirred to life, and after a moment, the attached light turned on.
A square of light appeared on the shop wall.
I adjusted the lens I received from the photography studio manager and focused it.
Mad just stared intently at my movements.
Mad, I'm going to play the movie now. Is that alright?
…Do as you damn well please.
Mad didn't deny it.
I'm certain that's the answer Mad wanted to give.
I placed my finger on the button on the control panel…
──Playing.
Mad stared at the square of light with a stern expression.
Within the light, a story begins.
It's the story of a single boy.
It was set in an era when the sky was still blue and nature remained.
Born in a small house in a small town, he never knew his mother.
The father he lived with only provided the bare minimum… it was hardly a relationship you could call family.
And as the boy grew up, the gap between them deepened.
They would fight whenever they saw each other's faces.
Every short conversation was a denial of each other.
Before long, their gazes stopped meeting.
The boy returned home less and less, and eventually stepped onto the path of evil.
His father silently struck him.
His brow furrowed more deeply than usual…
The boy runs out of the house and leaves town.
But that was the beginning of harsh days.
He was conveniently used and betrayed by those he thought were his friends, leaving him battered in body and soul.
The one who supported him through all of that was a woman.
His meeting with her would lead him down the right path.
The boy washed his hands of bad deeds and decided to move to a new town and start his life over.
──He had a family.
A son was born, and he believed without a doubt that he would continue to live happily with his beloved wife.
But… the woman passed away from illness.
There was no time to despair.
He worked desperately to raise the child he had left behind.
However, he was so desperate to work that he didn't realize a gap was forming in his relationship with his child.
Every time they opened their mouths, they would only fight.
Days of drifting apart continued.
And the child, now grown, stepped onto the path of evil as if to spite him…
He thought it was a punishment.
Isn't this exactly what I did to my father?
Now, he curses his immature past.
He thought about how to stop his son, and stared at his hands.
If he opened his hand, he might be able to gently reason with his son, stroking his head and embracing him.
If he clenched his fist, it would become a fist, and he might be able to admonish his son with severity.
As a father, which should he choose?
──He clenched his fist.
The fist that struck his son was hot, his chest ached as if it were being squeezed… deep wrinkles etched into his brow.
But, his son, holding his red and swollen cheek, shed tears.
He had been properly scolded, he was loved… or so he thought.
Hearing those words, he too shed tears.
Why couldn't he have realized what his son had realized back then?
That the face of his father after hitting him wasn't one of anger, but of sorrow.
He took his son and returned to the town where he was born for the first time in 20 years.
The townscape was almost unchanged from when he ran away.
And the small family home, as expected, remained unchanged.
But his father, who lived alone in that house, looked a size smaller than he remembered, perhaps due to old age.
He stood before his father, biting his lip and shedding tears.
His father silently patted him lightly on the shoulder and muttered only one word.
Mad's son's movie was a very old-fashioned type of human drama.
I don't know if it's interesting.
If my emotional functions were normal, I might be able to judge.
But Mad was engrossed in the screen.
He watched the movie in silence from beginning to end.
The end credits finished rolling, and the screen went completely black.
It seems to be over.
Shiona glanced at me once before reaching for the projector's stop button.
The moment her slender fingertip was about to touch the button, I grasped Shiona's hand.
"...? Rei?"
Shiona looked at me with a puzzled expression. But I was staring at the screen.
The screen, which had been completely black, now slowly had words appearing in the center.
The letters, probably handwritten, contained a clear "emotion."
『This film is dedicated to my father』
The words slowly melted into the darkening screen and disappeared.
This time, the movie quietly came to an end.
Silence fell around us.
Even after I turned off the power, Mad was still staring intently at the place where the screen had been.
"Mad... the movie's over, you know?"
A sigh was the response to my words.
"...A boring movie."
He muttered this in a small voice, unlike anything I'd heard from Mad before.
"It was so boring, I got tired of holding back my yawns."
He wiped away the tears that had accumulated from holding back the yawns, as if discarding them, then stood up from the chair and removed the chip from the projector.
Then he clenched it tightly in his palm and sat back down in the chair.
"...Hurry up and get out of here."
He said this in a voice with little inflection, then closed his eyes as if pondering something.
Could it be that the son's feelings didn't reach him through this movie?
Was it just a movie that Mad didn't care about...?
If so, what I did was──
My chest tightened, and I hurriedly called out to Mad, feeling like I had to say something.
But Shiona lightly tugged on my clothes, stopping me.
"Rei, it's okay."
Shiona smiled, lowering the corners of her eyebrows.
"Mad just can't be honest with himself. Let's leave him alone for now, okay?"
Can't be honest...?
In other words, everything Mad said just now was the opposite of what he meant?
"Mad is very clear right now. He's filled with a beautiful light blue. It's thanks to Rei."
"I wonder... if that's the case..."
I feel warmth deep in my chest.
I know this feeling.
It's the emotion called 『joy』.
I'm happy that Mad was pleased with what I did.
I'm overjoyed that I was able to be of help.
We quietly left the shop, so as not to disturb Mad.
Leaving the projector behind so he can watch movies again, whenever he likes.
When we got outside, I could faintly see an orange glow on the other side of the sky.
It was a color that seemed to reflect my own feelings.
"I'm really glad Mad was happy."
"Yes, me too."
But her smile seemed a little sad.
"Eh? What is it?"
"You seem sad somehow."
"Really? I'm not. Mad being happy makes my heart feel all round and full."
"Is that so? If you say so."
"Hey, Rei. Shall we have a feast tonight?"
"A feast? Why?"
"Because it's the anniversary of Rei making Mad happy."
"Anniversary... yeah, it's an anniversary."
"Let's make orange soup and have a fluffy, floaty day today, okay?"
"Yeah, let's do that. I'll help with the cooking."
"Thank you. That makes me very happy, Rei."
Shiona's hand touched mine.
Without a word, we held hands.
The warmth was born within our joined hands.
The orange sky was eventually swallowed by the encroaching darkness of night.
The next day, we decided to sing in the plaza, as we had promised everyone who helped us repair the projector.
Since we had the chance, we wanted Mad to listen with us, so we visited his shop.
But the doors remained closed.
Even though it's usually open by now, a sign reading 'CLOSED' was hanging there.
The shop door was locked, and we couldn't get inside.
I peeked inside the shop through the gap in the door.
The projector was left on the counter.
Nothing had changed since yesterday.
The chair where Mad was sitting was blocked from view by the shelf.
“I wonder what's wrong, Mad. Maybe he's not feeling well?”
“...I knew it would end up like this.”
“End up like this...? What do you mean?”
I tilted my head at Shiona, who spoke as if she knew the shop would be closed.
“From the middle of yesterday's movie, Mad's spiky redness disappeared.”
“Spiky redness...?”
“Yeah, I don't think he needs to endure it anymore. It was the first time I'd seen Mad so calm.”
Shiona smiled, looking troubled.
“Was Mad enduring something all this time?”
“That's right. He really, really wanted to reconcile with his son. He wanted to fly to his son's side. But Mad is always so red and prickly, right? So he never had the chance.”
“So, maybe yesterday's movie was...?”
“That's right. Because Rei showed Mad his son's movie, Mad was able to be honest with himself.”
“...So, maybe Mad went to see his son?”
“Yeah. I think he left town.”
Shiona smiled sweetly. Seeing that smile, I truly realized that I had been able to help Mad.
My chest suddenly felt warm, and it turned into words that came out of my mouth.
“Amazing! That's amazing, Shiona! It's just like that movie! It wasn't the son who went to see his father, but it's almost exactly like the movie!”
“Yes, it is. It's really amazing. But there's just one thing that's troubling me.”
“Troubling?”
Shiona's expression clouded over, and she let out a small sigh.
Even though Mad and his son are reconciling, what could be troubling her?
“I don't think Mad will be back for a while, so we won't be able to get the ingredients for the orange, fluffy soup.”
Shiona said with a serious face.
“That's... troubling, isn't it?”
“Yeah, it's troubling, right? But if we make it while conserving the ingredients we have now, we'll be okay for a while.”
Shiona relaxed her tight lips and smiled.
Looking at her, I felt my cheeks naturally move.
From deep within my chest, something warm welled up.
I don't know what to call this feeling, but I feel very fulfilled.
“I hope Mad comes back soon. I'd really like to hear his story. Maybe his son will come with him, too. That would be even better.”
“Yes, I agree. I hope that happens.”
Little by little, I'm able to learn about emotions. I was really feeling it.
I'm getting closer to the image of who I want to be.
I want to help people more and more.
I want to learn more and more emotions.
That feeling was the biggest driving force behind me.
“Let's get going, Rei. It's getting late.”
“That's right. Let's hurry. I wonder how many people we can make smile today.”
“I'm sure it will be a lot. Even more than yesterday.”
“It's because Shiona's singing voice is beautiful.”
“No, it's because of Rei's playing.”
“Even if you call it playing, I'm just turning the handle.”
“That's what's important. When the person turning it has a kind heart, the music becomes warm and spreads out softly.”
Shiona smiled as she gently spread her hands.
“If it were just my singing, I'm sure no one would stop. My singing is only possible because of Rei's playing. Thank you, Rei.”
My face flushed.
“Why is that, Shiona? My face is really hot.”
“Really? Your face is bright red. You must be embarrassed.”
“Embarrassed? Is this the emotion called embarrassment?”
“Yeah, Rei, you're surprisingly shy, aren't you? Cute.”
Hearing Shiona's words, my face grew even hotter.
After leaving Mad's shop, we visited the plaza.
Even before we arrived, many people had already gathered there.
“We've been waiting for you two! We're counting on you again today!”
“My child has been saying 'Let's go listen to the songs!' since yesterday. Please sing for us.”
“Your songs are so healing. Thank you so much.”
“Big brother, big sister, sing for us again!”
Everyone we met was waiting for our melody.
And everyone had a smile on their face.
This was it.
This is what I had been searching for.
Doing something, being appreciated by people, and being thanked.
This is what I wanted.
What a great feeling.
What warmth deep in my heart.
I wanted to experience this feeling forever.
“Shiona, let's start. Let's make everyone smile.”
“Yeah, of course.”
I turned the music box handle just like yesterday.
The melody overflows.
Shiona weaves a melody to match the sound.
And that melody spreads a large circle of smiles.
Smiles spread throughout the town.
That made me happier than anything.
And Shiona's profile as she sang so happily was my joy.
The townspeople listened with smiles, just like yesterday.
The circle of smiles widens.
Suddenly—I felt a slight discomfort in the hand turning the music box handle.
My right hand, gloved to hide the mechanical hand.
I feel a slight creak in that hand turning the handle.
“Hey, how was that machine from the day before yesterday?”
While I was cleaning up after the performance, I was spoken to and looked up.
There was the director and the townspeople who had provided the parts.
“It was able to play, and Mad was happy. It's all thanks to you all.”
“I see, that's good. It was worth calling out to everyone.”
“It's really thanks to all of you, thank you very much.”
“No, it's nothing... but you know, it's all thanks to your power.”
“Ah, that's right. Because of your actions, people came forward to cooperate like this.”
“But that's because everyone is kind. My actions are just a trigger.”
“Of course, that's part of it. But you won't know or change anything unless you take action. It's not about who's the greatest or who's amazing. The person who acts first has that much value.”
The director and all the people who cooperated wore warm smiles.
“If there's anything else, don't hesitate to ask. We'll cooperate as much as we can.”
The director and the others said that and then dispersed.
Watching them leave, I thought.
“Hey, Shiona.”
“What's wrong, Rei?”
“I really want to make more people happy.”
“Making people happy is a truly wonderful thing.”
“Yes, it is. But being able to feel that way is wonderful, Rei.”
I was a little happy to be praised by Shiona.
I can feel the depths of my heart gradually warming.
“That's why I want to help and be useful to many people. I want to meet more and more people and help them solve their problems and troubles.”
“If that's what you want to do, Rei, I think it's a good idea.”
“Then Shiona, let's go find them! Let's go help the people in this town who are in trouble!”
“...wait.”
“You see, Rei, I think that's a little different.”
I was convinced that Shiona would agree with me.
But she shook her head, looking troubled.
“Certainly, helping people is a wonderful thing. But, I think it's wrong to force it on them.”
“Force it...? I don't intend to do anything like that?”
“Of course, I understand how you feel, Rei. But, people have walls and problems that they have to overcome on their own. If you help them with everything, they won't grow. Of course, helping them is important, but first, that person has to really try their best, and only when they can't overcome it on their own do they need help. So, Rei, let's help someone when they ask for it. It's not too late to help them then.”
I understood what Shiona was saying.
I was able to understand it.
But deep down, I felt like something was bothering me.
Why must I leave my desire to help people as it is?
Why shouldn't I help people on my own?
Why, why, why...?
At that point, I stopped thinking.
Because Shiona's smile seemed somehow sad.
A few days later.
The discomfort resurfaced.
It was the discomfort in my right hand that I had felt when I was playing the music box.
A sensation so small that I couldn't put it into words.
But it was definitely attacking my right hand.
The discomfort was gradually increasing.
After returning to Shiona's house, I tried moving my fingertips one by one in my room.
Then, when each finger reached a certain depth, it would not bend any further.
I can't grab anything with this.
This is a problem that will interfere with my daily life.
No matter how many times I try, the problem doesn't go away.
Maybe it needs a fundamental repair, like taking it apart once.
I have a clue about the cause of this malfunction--I do.
It was when I was looking for that projector.
I really pushed myself too hard in that junkyard.
I felt a strange sensation when I was moving heavy things.
I'll go to that abandoned factory later today.
And I'll go look for tools for the repair.
"Rei, it's time for dinner."
Shiona suddenly enters the room.
I hurriedly put on my gloves and hid my exposed right hand.
"What's wrong? Why are you in such a hurry?"
"It's nothing. I was just spacing out, so you startled me."
"Did I surprise you? I'm sorry about that. I'll knock next time."
"Yeah, thanks. I'd appreciate that."
"Okay, I understand. So, dinner's ready, are you going to eat now?"
I look at the clock.
Before I knew it, the clock's hands had already passed the top.
"It's already this late..."
"It's always so cloudy outside. It makes you lose track of time, doesn't it?"
"Yeah, I'll be there soon. Will you wait for me?"
"Okay, I understand. I'll be waiting in the kitchen, Rei."
Shiona smiled sweetly and left the room.
I took off my gloves again and checked my right hand.
...Somehow, I have to keep Shiona from finding out.
Even if I go to the abandoned factory, it will be after I eat.
I steeled myself and headed to the kitchen.
In the kitchen, Shiona's homemade dishes were lined up.
"Rei, have a seat. Let's eat."
Shiona clasped her hands in front of her face.
I put my hands together in the same way.
"Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil."
These words were taught to me by Shiona.
Before I knew it, I had started offering the same prayer.
That's how much time I've spent with Shiona.
Thinking that, the depths of my heart naturally warmed.
"Huh? It's nothing, really."
"Is that so? You have a happy look on your face? It's all orange and fluffy."
"A happy look? Me...?"
"Yes, very, very much so. Rei, you've been making that face a lot lately. It makes me happy too."
"Does that mean... I'm 'smiling'?"
"Yes, that's right. You didn't smile at all at first, but lately you've been smiling a lot. I'm so happy."
"I'm... smiling...?"
I recall the first day I awoke.
On that day, the face I saw was expressionless.
From that day on, I continued to wish.
I want emotions.
Before I knew it, I seemed to be starting to obtain what I desired.
I felt a lightness in the depths of my heart, glad that this was happening.
With this, I can be with Shiona and the others forever.
I looked down at my right hand.
With this hand, hanging limply and powerless, I can't even use a spoon properly.
Reluctantly, I switched to my left hand and scooped up the soup.
Eating with my unfamiliar left hand proved extremely difficult.
"What's wrong, Rei...? Oh, wait, Rei, are you left-handed?"
"No... I'm right-handed, but my right hand is kind of sore today."
"It hurts? That's terrible! We have to call a doctor... Ah, but there aren't any in this town, so we'll have to call one from a town far away..."
"No, it's okay. It'll heal if I just leave it alone."
This is bad... this is bad.
If a doctor sees me, my true identity will be exposed.
I have to avoid that at all costs.
I want to stay here forever.
"It's probably because you overdid it the other day. Working so hard in the rain..."
"...Yeah, I think that's probably it."
"See, you didn't stop when I told you to. I'm worried about your body, Rei."
"Yeah, thanks. But thanks to that hard work, Mad was happy, so it was worth it."
"Yes, that's true. But don't push yourself too hard."
Shiona looks at me with a worried expression.
I won't do anything that makes her make that face again.
Seeing Shiona with any expression other than a smile makes my heart turn blue.
"Speaking of which, I wonder if Mad-san has returned yet. Have you heard from him since then?"
"Not yet. His son lives a little far away. I'm sure he hasn't arrived yet."
"I see. I hope you hear from him soon."
"Yeah, me too."
After that, Shiona didn't ask me about my right hand.
I finished my meal quickly with my unfamiliar left hand.
Then I returned to my room and began to prepare.
I packed my tools into a bag.
I'll probably end up disassembling my own arm.
I need to solve this on my own.
I can't rely on anyone.
That's why I made thorough preparations.
As I was concentrating on the preparations, I heard a knock on the door.
Immediately after, Shiona came into the room.
"Rei, if you're free, want to go shopping...? Are you going somewhere?"
Shiona asked, looking back and forth between my bag and me.
"Yeah. I'm just looking for something."
"Where are you going? Is it close? Far? When will you be back?"
"I'm going to the abandoned factory. I'm planning to come back as soon as possible."
"Abandoned factory? What are you going there for?"
"Well... actually, the photography studio manager asked me for some parts, and I'm going to look for them."
It was a lie.
It was a clumsy lie, but Shiona smiled at me.
"I see... Okay. Please be really careful, okay? Your right hand isn't in good shape as it is, right?"
"Yeah, thanks. I'll try to get back as soon as possible."
I was seen off by Shiona and left the church.
My destination is the abandoned factory--.
But, there was a place I had to stop by before that.
I need to cover up the lie I blurted out on the spur of the moment.
If, by any chance, Shiona meets the manager and tells him about me, the lie will be exposed.
If that happens, I'll end up hurting Shiona.
I don't want to hurt Shiona.
That's why my feet were taking me to the photography studio.
Oh, a rare customer indeed.
When I opened the door, the manager, who was polishing a camera, greeted me.
I'm sorry for intruding so suddenly.
No, it's fine... I was just about to head home myself.
Home... to the church? Did you have some business there?
Ah, just wait a moment.
The manager disappeared into the back.
While waiting, I decided to look around at the photos on display.
There were various photos on display, from old ones to recent ones.
The years they were taken, the places, and the people were all different.
But there was one thing they all had in common.
That was that everyone was smiling.
I couldn't help but envy the people in those smiling photos.
Well now, sorry to keep you waiting. Here, this is it.
The manager handed me a photo.
In it were a smiling Shiona and a expressionless me.
It's a photo I took a while ago. It took a while to develop. I apologize for the delay.
That's not true at all. Thank you very much. But, I don't have any money...
It's fine. It was delayed, and I took it because I wanted to. I'll make it a service.
Thank you very much. I'll give it to Shiona.
Please do. Even so, looking at it like this, you and Shiona's brother really do look alike.
You know about Shiona's brother?
Ah, of course. Have you ever seen a picture of Shiona and her brother together?
Yes, I have. The one where they're holding a music box, right?
Ah, that's the one. Actually, I'm the one who took that picture.
Is that so...? When did her brother leave on his journey?
It was right after I took that picture, I think. He said he was going to spread music all over the world. Shiona was so sad. She's always smiling like that, but she was crying the whole time then.
Shiona was? I can't believe it...
...But, you know, she's been smiling a lot more lately. As much as when her brother was around... No, maybe even more.
Is that so? I think she's been smiling the whole time, for sure.
I'm sure it's because you're here.
I think it's partly because you resemble her brother, but I don't think that's all there is to it.
But I haven't been able to do anything for Shiona.
Making someone smile isn't just about doing something for them. You can also make them smile just by being near them, by being by their side.
Being by her side... If that's the case, I'm confident that I can be by Shiona's side more than anyone else.
I can see that too. When Shiona is with you, she seems to be showing a smile from the bottom of her heart.
Those words warmed my heart.
I'm connected to Shiona's smile.
Because I'm here, Shiona is--
It's strange for me to ask, but will you stay near Shiona forever?
Of course. Always and forever, I'll stay by Shiona's side and keep her smiling. That's my greatest wish.
Hahaha, it's like a proposal. It's a shame Shiona isn't here to see this.
A pro...posal...?
Hearing those words, I felt my face getting hot.
I know the meaning of the word.
It's a promise between a man and a woman to spend their lives together.
Was what I just said the same as that?
Thinking about it that way, my face gets even hotter.
I turn my back to the shop owner so he won't notice my agitation.
Um, well, I have somewhere to be, so...
Is that so? Don't lose that picture, now.
Yes, thank you very much.
I thanked him over my shoulder and left the photo shop.
The road to the abandoned factory.
I push forward through the reddish-black earth.
The bag full of tools is a heavy burden.
I could hear the tools rubbing against each other in the bag slung over my shoulder.
The wind is strong, and it looks like it's about to rain.
If I go to fix it and end up making more things broken, that would defeat the purpose.
Hoping it wouldn't rain, I hurried to the abandoned factory.
On the way.
In the distance, I spotted something white flickering.
But the location was too far away, and there was no way to confirm what that object was.
I still couldn't tell how big it was, but that white object seemed to be slowly approaching me.
I strained my eyes and tried to get a better look.
At that moment, a gust of wind blew.
I reflexively closed my eyes.
When I opened my eyes again, the white object had disappeared from sight.
What on earth was that just now...?
For a while, I stood there, frozen in place.
But I can't stay like this.
The clouds are getting more and more ominous.
I have to get to the abandoned factory quickly.
Just as the dark clouds threatened to unleash rain, I arrived at the abandoned factory.
The inside was as dusty as ever, filled with the smell of oxidized oil.
Immediately finding a nearby workbench, I decided to remove the glove from my right hand.
I'm already used to the exposed parts.
First, I'll try slowly opening and closing my fingers.
The malfunction wasn't fixed, and the movement stopped halfway.
What could be the cause?
I took out a light from my bag and shined it on my arm, peering inside.
It doesn't seem like there's any foreign object stuck in there.
…In that case, it must be a problem with the internal parts themselves.
I took out my tools and began disassembling my right hand.
I felt a sense of unease at disassembling my own hand.
I am now destroying myself.
If I were to disassemble all of this, would I break down?
Is that my "death?"
I wonder, what kind of feeling would that be?
If I die, where will this consciousness disappear to?
And if it were reassembled once more, would this consciousness return?
Could that be called being alive?
While thinking about such things in the back of my mind, I arrived at the cause of the malfunction.
The piston rod of the cylinder that supplies oil to the fingers was bent, and oil was seeping out.
It's a part I removed once when I fixed Shiona's music box.
At that time, I used the oil inside the cylinder to lubricate the gears of the music box.
It was only a small amount of oil, but it must have been a necessary amount for the intricately moving prosthetic finger.
So even small tears, when accumulated, can become a large wound, huh?
However, with the rod bent this far, even if I fix it halfway, the oil leak might recur.
The most reliable thing to do would be to replace this part entirely with a new one.
I stood up and decided to search around.
Phyloid parts in the middle of being made were scattered on the floor.
If it's here at the Phyloid factory, there's bound to be a part that fits my model lying around.
With my right arm disassembled, I searched the factory.
There were many arm, leg, and torso parts scattered around the factory.
The head parts are so elaborate that, if you're not careful, you might think they're real for a moment.
I searched among them for something that would fit me.
Looking at my exposed right arm, I confirmed the model number of the part I needed.
That seems to be the model number of the necessary part.
I searched for the same model number from the arm parts scattered around.
Am I using something that's really that rare?
Even after examining all the parts scattered around the factory, there wasn't one with the same model number.
The state of decay of this factory is much more advanced compared to the place where I woke up.
I can tell it's a facility that was abandoned a long, long time ago.
In that case, it's understandable that the manufacturing dates are different and there aren't any parts with the same model number.
While searching for parts in a panic, I discovered something marked 'AR115'.
Its appearance is an almost identical shape to the part that was embedded in my arm.
However, the piston rod and shaft are a little long.
With this, it looks like I can replace it with just a little modification.
I placed the arm with 'AR115' attached on the workbench and began disassembling it.
After successfully removing the part, I compared it with the part that was originally embedded in me—'HR114'.
It seems that 'AR115' has an output terminal added that didn't exist in 'HR114'.
There are no other changes.
I immediately tried attaching the part to my arm.
Unlike when disassembling, the installation work was a little difficult.
After dropping the screws many times, I somehow managed to finish the installation.
When I moved my fingers, I was able to open and close them as before.
However, each time, a dissonant sound of machines rubbing against each other echoed around me.
It seems the lubricant has run out.
Seeking oil, I proceeded deeper into the factory.
As the smell of oxidized oil intensified, I came across a dark black drum.
When I opened them, they were all oxidized and unusable.
But in the very back, I found a relatively new drum.
When I opened it, there was a small amount of oil inside with little oxidation.
I scooped up the oil with the oil storage tank installed inside my arm.
Then, I returned the tank to its original location.
After a while, the oil was automatically extracted, improving the smoothness of the mechanical parts.
When I moved them, I could open and close my fingers without any dissonant sounds.
I was able to fix it.
Looking at my smoothly moving fingertips, I felt a sense of clarity spreading deep within my chest.
I put my gloves back on, returned the tools to my bag, and left the factory.
Outside, the wind had gotten quite strong.
I hope it doesn't rain...
I hurried back to town.
—On the way.
A white object had fallen to the ground.
It fluttered as if being toyed with by the raging wind.
After staring at it for a while, I realized it was a cloak.
With the nth flutter, I could see something wrapped inside.
It had the shape of a person.
Thinking it couldn't be, I rushed over to it, knelt down on one knee, and gently lifted the cloak.
There lay a young man with severe injuries.
The blood flowing from his wounded arm—I immediately knew he was human.
"A-Are you alright!?"
"Ugh... ugh..."
The young man groaned, as if reacting to my voice.
His body was painfully injured, and he didn't seem to be in a condition to stand up.
At the young man's feet were traces as if he had crawled there.
The traces were stained with blood, telling a story of hardship.
—I have to help him.
Something akin to a sense of mission seeped from within my chest into my entire body.
"Please hang in there, are you alright!"
I threw the bag I had slung over my shoulder onto the ground and helped the young man up.
Perhaps the movement caused him pain, as the young man grimaced and groaned even more intensely.
And then, as if clinging to something, he reached out his hand.
Without thinking, I offered my open right hand.
My mechanical hand was grasped through the glove.
I messed up—I inwardly cursed myself.
But the strength in his hand was so weak that, conversely, I couldn't shake him off.
The young man slowly opened his eyes and looked at me.
"Y...you... you..."
"A-Are you alright? There's a town nearby. I'll carry you there right away."
"T...town..."
He muttered, as if echoing my words with vacant eyes.
And then, as if confirming the hand he was holding, he traced the glove with his powerless fingers.
I'm sure he's realized it.
He must have noticed the hard texture, different from that of a human, through the glove.
But it doesn't matter.
This isn't a situation where I can worry about that.
"...D-Do you... l-live... in... th-that town...?"
"T...town... live...?"
The young man repeats "town" like a mantra.
The words are weak, as if they might disappear at any moment.
I decided to take this young man back with me.
Maybe, just maybe, I can save this person now.
I put his arm over my shoulder and half-dragged, half-carried the young man.
His steps were heavy, and it took a considerable amount of time to advance even ten meters.
But I wanted to help this person... I was filled with the desire to save him.
"You... since when... town...?"
The man, who looked like he was about to faint at any moment, asked me.
"It's only been about a week."
"I see... I... see..."
I could feel the young man weakening over my shoulder.
If I don't keep him conscious, he might not come back.
"Please hang in there, we'll be in town soon, very soon. It's not that big, but the people there are all warm and kind."
I desperately tried to talk to the young man.
If I could talk about something that would interest him even a little, he wouldn't lose consciousness.
"There aren't any doctors, but there are books, so I'm sure we can figure out how to treat your injuries."
"...B...books...?"
"Yes! We have everything. I'm sure we can look up anything. So please, hang in there."
"...Any...thing...?"
"Yes! For sure!"
The young man took a long, slow breath, then muttered softly.
"...Abandon me..."
I didn't understand what he said.
I stopped walking without thinking.
"...Me... Just leave me here... Abandon me..."
"T-There's no way I could do that!"
"I... was attacked by humans..."
"By humans...?"
"I was just... just traveling in search of an ideal... But, ideals are just... values..."
The young man took another long breath.
"Because of differing values... humans... clash, oppose, and fight... becoming cruel and... violent beyond measure..."
"T-That's not true! Humans are warm, and they can share many things, and support each other!"
"Ah, that is precisely the ideal..."
The young man exhaled all the breath he had taken, going limp.
"U-Um, please, hang in there! Please hang in there!"
I couldn't tell if he had just lost consciousness, or if...
Unpleasant thoughts swirled around in my head.
I gritted my teeth, looked straight ahead, and started walking towards town.
To help this person, even a second sooner.
Before I knew it, rain started to fall, striking our backs fiercely.
Rainwater seeped into my gloves, but I couldn't afford to worry about that.
I frantically carried the young man into the church.
"Rei, what's wro... Wh-Who is that!?"
Shiona greeted me, looking flustered.
"This person collapsed on the way! He's badly injured!"
"I understand. Carry him to the back."
Led by Shiona, I carried the young man to a room with a bed.
When I laid him down on the white sheets, the rainwater and blood on his body mixed, spreading into a red stain.
There was no sign of the young man regaining consciousness.
"Rei, I've brought some water."
I held the cup Shiona gave me to the young man's mouth.
I poured a little water in.
The young man's throat pulsed as he swallowed.
Even so, he didn't regain consciousness.
Compared to when I first met him, his complexion was considerably paler.
"Shiona, I'm going to the library! I'm sure there'll be medical books there!"
Shiona started to say something, then bit her lip.
I was concerned by her reaction, but right now, every second counts.
Ignoring Shiona, I rushed out of the room.
And without worrying about getting wet in the rain, I ran to the library.
"Rei, what's wrong? You're soaking wet."
Perhaps surprised by my sudden entrance, Tippy stared at me with wide eyes.
Without worrying about my ragged breathing, I asked.
"Tippy... are there any medical books here?"
"Y-Yes, there are."
"Please, can you take me there right away?"
"...Okay."
She must have sensed something was wrong.
Tippy immediately led me to the location.
"Is someone sick?"
Tippy asked, still facing forward as she led the way.
"Yeah... they're injured."
"Is it Rei? Shiona? Or...?"
"No, it's someone Tippy doesn't know. So, you don't have to look so sad."
"But... but, but..."
Large tears streamed down her cheeks.
That young man is someone Tippy doesn't know.
And yet, and yet...
To be able to shed tears for someone like that, what a kind child Tippy is.
"It's okay... it's okay."
I picked Tippy up and gently wrapped her in my arms.
I could feel her hot tears through my clothes.
I could feel a small ache deep in my chest.
Enduring that pain, I rummaged through the medical books.
But no matter how many books we have, we're just amateurs.
We don't know what the symptoms are, what kind of treatment to give, or even which book is correct.
I took as many books as I could carry from the library.
Not even caring that the books were getting wet, I returned to the church.
When I opened the door, a melody flowed out.
It was Shiona's singing.
That song alone was enough to recognize this as a sacred place.
"Shiona, how is he?"
"No... he still hasn't woken up. I've done everything I can, but..."
I ran to the young man's side.
The bandages wrapped around him must be Shiona's work.
But the young man's face was even paler than before.
I opened the medical books roughly.
I flipped through the pages, searching for anything we could do.
But we were far too reckless.
No matter how wonderful these medical books are, they're ultimately just bundles of paper.
There was no way we could save someone with medicine from the start, not with our lack of skill.
We were far too powerless, far too insignificant.
Shiona quietly began to sing.
Unlike usual, it was a quiet melody, like a requiem.
"...Hmm...this song..."
The young man opened his eyes to Shiona's song.
But his gaze was hollow, as if he were about to disappear at any moment.
"Do you know this song?"
"Ah, it's a nostalgic tune...I used to sing it often..."
The young man's gaze traced the ceiling, then turned to me and Shiona.
Suddenly, the young man's expression softened.
"...Ah, so it was here...the world I was searching for was here..."
"What do you mean? The world you were searching for, what exactly is it...?"
Perhaps the young man could no longer hear, as he didn't answer my question.
He just continued to speak unilaterally.
"...A path to coexistence...a world of harmony..."
After saying that, the young man quietly closed his eyes.
He didn't twitch or move after that.
I felt something spilling out from the depths of my heart.
"Hey, Shiona, why won't he open his eyes? Is he sleeping?"
"The power he had just obtained is also rapidly fading away..."
"Hey, I wonder why...is he just tired, maybe...?"
An indescribable sense of loss hung heavily in my heart like dark clouds.
A pain ran through me as if the depths of my heart were being churned up.
Shiona hugged me from behind.
Her warmth allowed me to calm down a little.
Naturally, I placed my hands over Shiona's hands that were wrapped around my chest.
"Shiona...I, I..."
"Rei...let's hold a funeral for him."
"A funeral...?"
"It's like a ceremony that's performed when someone dies."
"When someone dies..."
With those words, I realized.
Ah, this person has died.
"That's the only way we can mourn the dead."
I couldn't move, listening to Shiona's words.
I couldn't quite process the concept of death that had appeared before my eyes.
"Well, there are preparations to be made, so will you help me?"
I could only give a short nod.
We began to prepare for the funeral.
To mourn this young man whose name we didn't even know.
As we proceeded with the preparations for the ceremony, there was only one thing that bothered me.
I had left Tipi, who had been crying so much, in the library.
Was Tipi still crying?
In that dark library. All alone.
"Rei, what's wrong?"
Shiona spoke to me as my hands had stopped while decorating the altar.
"Yeah...there's something I'm a little worried about."
"Something you're worried about? What is it? Is it about that man?"
"No, it's not that...it's about Tipi."
"Tipi-chan? What about Tipi-chan?"
"When I went to get the medical book, I told Tipi everything about that person. And then, Tipi started crying...and the worst part is, I left Tipi in the library."
"You turned pale and left her there."
"Yeah, that's right. So, I was thinking that she might still be crying..."
"...Yeah, maybe. I'm sure she's crying in the back of the library."
I could easily imagine that scene.
Thinking about it, I couldn't stand still.
"Shiona, do you mind if I go check on Tipi for a bit?"
Shiona gave me a sad-looking smile.
"There's still a little more to do to prepare for the funeral. So, I'd be happy if you came back soon."
"Yeah, I know. I'll be right back."
"...Okay. See you later."
Shiona still gave me a somewhat sad smile.
I finished decorating the altar and headed to the library.
With the medical book I had borrowed.
I walked through the town, which had become a light rain, with an umbrella.
The town's appearance was somehow different than usual.
As if something important was missing, lost...
I ran through the town of loss and hurried to the library.
The inside of the library was enveloped in silence, as if blocking out the sound of rain.
--No, except for one thing.
The sound of a blue-haired girl sobbing from the back.
I followed the sound of the girl's crying.
The girl was in her usual place.
As usual, the girl was drawing pictures while shedding tears.
"Rei... Rei..."
When she recognized me, Tipi reached out her small hands.
As if in reply, I hugged her small body.
The moment I hugged her, her sobs grew a little louder.
"Rei... what happened to that person?"
I was choked by those words.
"Hey, Rei... Rei..."
"That person... hey... hey, hey..."
Silence had become the answer.
Perhaps Tipi understood everything, she began to cry loudly without holding back her sadness.
For that young man she had never met, large tears spilled down her face.
Ah, why is this?
What is this pain in my chest?
The depths of my chest are being stirred up into a mess.
It occasionally hurt and wounded my chest.
Surely it was something overflowing from the wound opened in my chest.
That heat is overflowing from my eyes.
Before I knew it, I was crying.
I was shedding tears for the death of a young man I didn't even know.
Ah, I see.
This is 'sadness'.
This is a blue emotion.
This is the emotion that Tipi always keeps lit in her heart.
It's such a painful and difficult thing.
Tears flow endlessly.
I don't know how to stop them.
--No, that's not right.
I didn't want to stop them.
I wanted to keep letting these overflowing hot droplets flow.
Surely these droplets are an act of healing sadness.
By letting the sadness accumulated deep within our hearts flow out, we maintain our hearts.
Thinking that, I felt that the weight accumulated deep within my chest had become a little lighter.
And at the same time, I also felt that the amount of overflowing tears had increased.
I cried.
We cried.
Letting out sobs, embracing each other, we cried.
Crying, crying, crying...
No matter how long it took, the tears never dried up.
As if sadness would never wither, the tears continued to overflow.
"Tipi, there will be a funeral soon."
"...A funeral? What... is that?"
"It's a ceremony to say goodbye to someone who has died. Shiona is preparing for it now."
"A goodbye...? What's a goodbye...?"
"It means you can't see them anymore."
"Can't see them anymore... No!"
Tipi clings tightly to me.
Her arms were trembling slightly.
"I understand how you feel, Tipi. But you know, that's precisely why we have to say a proper goodbye, I think."
"Because we can't see them anymore, let's say goodbye and see them off. Otherwise, I'm sure we'll be lonely and sad..."
"Lonely... sad..."
"Yes, I'm sure we will. That's why we're sending them off. So we won't be lonely or sad... Can you do that?"
Tipi slowly pulled away from me.
With tears still streaming down her face, she looked up at me.
"...I can. Tipi can do it."
"I see. That's great, Tipi."
When I stroked her head, she looked a little happy.
But the tears never stopped.
"Well then, shall we go...? Can you stand?"
"Yes... Just a moment."
Tipi stood up and picked up her teddy bear.
Her constant companion, her teddy bear, is still in her arms.
We held hands and headed to the church in the rain.
"Merciful God, our Father, we entrust to Your hands this young man who has finished his journey in the hope of eternal life, believing in Your only begotten Son, whom You sent."
"Take away all the burdens of this brother and sister who are leaving us, lead them to the dwelling prepared in heaven, and add them to the assembly of saints."
"May we, who are in the sorrow of parting, also be supported by the hope of the resurrection promised by the Lord, and may we share eternal joy with the child who has been called to You."
Shiona's voice echoed through the church, which was overflowing with attendees.
No one here should have ever seen that young man.
No one here should know that young man.
Even so, everyone who gathered here mourned the young man's death.
This is what it means to care for others, the connection between people, I thought.
Everyone clasped their hands in front of their chests, quietly closing their eyes and offering prayers.
Both Tipi and I followed suit.
Shiona's voice solemnly echoed through the church.
It was as if it were a song she was dedicating to the young man…
After the funeral, the young man was buried in the cemetery behind the church.
For one last farewell, the townspeople approached the coffin one by one, offering words of goodbye.
May you have a good afterlife…
Let's meet again someday…
Eternal rest…
They offered their respective words.
"Come on, Tipi."
It was our turn, and we approached the coffin.
Tipi stared intently at the coffin containing the young man.
The tears she had been shedding right up until the funeral were gone, and she just stared at the young man expressionlessly.
As if she had lost all emotion.
Just silently.
Staring intently, intently at the coffin.
Seeing this, I felt uneasy and tried to call out to Tipi.
But, a moment before I could, she opened her mouth.
She muttered in a small voice.
Several hours passed since then.
Light shone through the gaps in the clouds where the rain had stopped, which was rare.
It's unusual for sunlight to shine through the gray, cloudy sky.
But I wasn't captivated by the beautiful scenery.
Because I was concerned about the expression on Tipi's face during the funeral.
That expression that was too empty to be called sadness.
I don't know what it means.
Even so, there's only one thing I think.
I want to be by her side.
I want to be by Tipi's side and talk to her.
And I want to heal that sadness.
That feeling grows stronger within me.
Just as I was about to open the door to the room, Shiona stopped me.
"Yeah, I was thinking of going to see Tipi."
"During the funeral, Tipi looked so sad, I got worried."
"I see... but you know, I'm worried about you, Rei."
"Yeah. Because Rei, you have such a sad expression."
"Sad... ?"
I touch my cheek with my hand.
"You can't tell like that, can you? Here, come over here."
I was led by the hand into the living room and made to stand in front of a mirror.
"Look, you have a sad face, don't you?"
My face reflected in the mirror was... pale.
I understand now what Shiona always meant when she said Tipi was "pale."
Right now, I have the same face as Tipi.
My heart is quiet, but my body feels weak, and my expression is sinking as if pulled down by gravity.
"...Yeah, it's the first time I've seen my face like this."
This is... sadness.
Even without shedding tears, when you're captured by this emotion, your expression becomes so "pale."
"Someone died. It's only natural to have that kind of face."
These feelings... how are they necessary for living?
Bitter... painful..., heavy, aching, and cold...
I look at Shiona's expression reflected in the mirror.
But she wore a somewhat sad, ephemeral smile.
I'm sure she's putting on a brave face.
Just thinking about that makes the depths of my chest ache.
"You care about Tippy-chan, too. But you know, I want you to value yourself first."
"Me... value myself?"
"Yes, that's right. I want Rei to value Rei himself."
"Value myself... I've never thought about that before."
"Rei, you're so kind. That's why I'm sure you prioritize others over yourself."
"But that's what I want to do."
"I'm a little sad about that. I don't want you to push yourself too hard."
"I'm not pushing myself."
"Is that so? I can't think that way."
Shiona's arms entwined with mine.
"...I'm worried, you know."
I could feel my heart rate increasing.
I don't know what it is.
But it was certainly stirring my emotions.
In that warmth, I felt kindness.
...No, more than kindness... I feel a different kind of warmth, different from what I feel on my skin.
Hey Rei, how about we have some tea?
......Tea? Why?
When you drink something warm and fuzzy, your heart feels fuzzy too. It relaxes your mind and body, and it feels really good.
But Tippy...
Tippy-chan is probably shaken by the death of that person. But you know, I'm sure she can overcome it. So let's just leave her alone for a little while. Being alone is very important, you know?
Is that so?
Yes, I'm sure it is. Because if you don't, you can't become strong.
People can become stronger by overcoming walls and sorrows. But if they are helped by someone every time, they cannot grow easily. To help Tippy-chan grow, let's leave her alone today, okay?
Tippy is a weak being.
She's always crying.
But, if you're saying it's a chance for her to grow...
I'll accept it.
Shiona, will you make some tea for me?
Of course. Will you sit in a chair and wait?
I sat on the sofa and waited for Shiona's tea.
After waiting for a while, a nice scent filled the room.
Sorry to keep you waiting. Here's a special, heartwarming tea. Enjoy.
The offered teacup was filled with an orange-colored drink.
A faint sourness and a subtle sweetness waft through the air.
Like this. It's been a while since I've had a chance to talk with you slowly, Rei.
Yeah, it has. A lot's happened...
Rei, how's your memory?
No, it doesn't seem like it's coming back yet.
I see... But, there's no need to rush. You might just suddenly remember something one of these days.
Yeah, thanks... But, you know, I feel bad.
Feel bad? About what?
I'm staying here as a freeloader, but I haven't been able to repay Shiona for her kindness at all.
That's not true. I'm just happy to have you by my side, Rei.
But that's not repaying you at all.
It's not just that. You fixed the music box too... Thanks to that, I can sing now.
You were singing even before that, Shiona.
But you know, it's very different with and without a melody. Remember when we performed together in the plaza? Actually, I sang in that place many times before.
In that place... alone?
Yeah. But you know, no one would listen to me back then.
Even with such a wonderful singing voice? That's strange.
Hehe, thank you. But you know, that's just how it is. So you know, I was so happy when you brought the music box with you, Rei.
That... I was just turning the music box.
That's what makes me happy. Being next to you, being with you, is what makes me happiest of all.
I feel the same way. I'm happy to be with you, Shiona.
......Hehe. Thank you. Rei, you've become so much more expressive.
Expressive? Me?
Yes. Your expressions are so much richer than when we first met.
That was what I sought, what I desired.
It was what I had been longing for ever since I woke up.
Being told that by Shiona fills my heart.
The incomplete me is getting closer to being human... closer to Shiona, or so she tells me.
I'm sure it's because you're always smiling next to me, Shiona.
Is that so? I haven't done anything.
No, it's because you're here, Shiona. Thank you, I'm grateful.
If you're going to say that, then so am I. Thank you, Rei.
I'm the one who should be thanking you.
I'm the one who... Hehe, this is funny. Us thanking each other over and over.
You're right. What are we even doing?
......But you know, it's strange.
What's strange?
I'm thinking that I wish this time could last forever... That's strange, isn't it?
......No, not at all. I was thinking the same thing...
......Can I come over there?
Shiona sits next to me.
A distance where I can feel her warmth.
We are closer than we've ever been before.
Huh...? What is this...?
What's wrong?
Something feels strange in my body. My chest... it's pounding.
Could it be that I've broken down? I'd be troubled if it's a major malfunction requiring maintenance.
It's okay. I feel the same way. My chest has been pounding the whole time.
Eh? A-Are you okay? Does it hurt?
Yeah. This is a wonderful thing.
Shiona gently smiles shyly as she places her hand on mine.
Softly, as if enveloping it.
Responding to that, I turn my wrist. As if to align our palms... as if to intertwine our fingers.
I feel Shiona's warmth even more strongly.
And that warmth warms the depths of my heart.
The depths of my heart are warm, like, gently...
Your heart...? Here...?
Shiona's hand reaches for my chest.
The place she touched instantly became hot.
Shiona's hand feels so hot... I wonder why. Could it be a disease?
No, that's not it.
Do you know the cause, Shiona?
Yes, probably.
Tell me.
Hehe, what should I do?
Don't be mean. I'm curious.
Hmm... but you know, it's not just you, Rei.
The getting hot part?
Yes, that's right. My heart is also very hot right now.
You feel the same, Shiona?
Yes, the same. Maybe I'm in even worse shape than you, Rei.
That's terrible! How can we fix it?
No, we can't fix it... we don't need to fix it.
My heart is hot, it's tight, it's painful, it's sad, but it's warm... and that's okay. That's good, Rei.
Shiona's hand, which is on top of mine, got a little hotter.
I squeeze her hand back.
Rei, please.
I want you to stay with me forever.
Yeah... will you stay with me forever and ever?
Yeah... I promise.
Thank you, Rei. I'm so happy... so, so...
Shiona rested her head on my chest.
I felt like my heart was being filled.
It's similar to the feeling of joy I felt before, but it's a much stronger emotion.
What do humans call this?
I wanted to ask Shiona, but I thought it would be impolite to break this atmosphere.
So, just like this... I'll entrust myself and Shiona to time.
The sweet-smelling tea prepared on the table. We stayed like that until the steam disappeared.
The next day, I was getting ready to go out after finishing breakfast.
Shiona, who was washing the dishes, called out to me.
I was thinking of going to the library.
The library... are you going to see Tippy-chan?
Yes, that's the plan.
I'm sure Tippy-chan is still in the process of overcoming it. So, shouldn't we leave her be?
Yeah... but if she can't overcome it and is feeling lonely all by herself, I can't just leave her alone.
Just like Shiona was by my side yesterday and made me feel warm, I think I can support her just by being near her.
It's okay. Tippy-chan isn't that weak.
Do you think so...?
Yeah, I'm sure of it. More importantly, Rei, I have a favor to ask. Won't you go to the plaza today?
To the plaza? Why?
I want to bring the music box... and sing again.
Yeah, something sad happened, right? So, it's important to rest your heart.
Rest my heart...?
We had a funeral, and I'm sure everyone in town is feeling down. So, don't you want to brighten everyone's spirits?
...Everyone in town? Of course, I do.
It's painful to see sad faces.
If I can, I want to heal that sadness.
That's what our melody can do. I'm sure it will help the town regain its energy.
I see... Do you think so?
Yeah, I'm sure of it. Come on, let's get ready.
Urged by Shiona, I reach for the music box.
The music box, which I maintain every day, is always ready to play music.
We set off for the plaza.
It was a cloudy afternoon.
There were hardly any people there.
There's no one here, Shiona.
It's always like this at this time. Before you came, Rei.
Before I came...?
I told you, didn't I? Ever since you started playing music, everyone has started listening to my songs. The people in town are slowly changing. They're going out more, and interacting more. I feel like the connections between people are gradually getting stronger.
Is it... because I came?
Yes, I think so. Ever since you came, Rei, the people in town have been changing. In a good way, of course.
That was a very welcome thing to hear.
I'm being useful to someone.
That fact fills me with joy.
You look happy, Rei.
Yeah. Your cheeks are all loose.
My cheeks?
Yeah, look --
Shiona's fingertip touches my cheek.
Just that alone makes me feel a warmth deep inside my chest again.
My face feels kind of hot.
Rei, are you blushing? Ahaha.
My face gets even hotter.
It seems like what Shiona is saying is right on the mark.
Well then, Rei, shall we begin?
Yeah, is your preparation okay?
Whenever you're ready.
Shiona slowly closes her eyes.
I felt like I could look at that beautiful profile forever.
But just as much, I also want to hear Shiona's singing voice.
And so, I slowly began to turn the music box's handle.
Shiona's singing voice joined the melody.
The two melodies intertwined, filling the area with a beautiful timbre.
Soon, people began to gather.
At first, the people had slightly gloomy faces, but gradually they began to smile again.
And before anyone knew it, a large circle of smiles had spread across the plaza.
Town Child A
Town Person A
Town Person B
Town Person C
Town Person D
The smiles and words of various people are flying around.
Ah, this is it.
This is what I was looking for.
People with happy smiles.
Each time I see those smiles, my joy intensifies.
I was saddened that that girl wasn't in the circle.
The blue-haired girl in the back of the library.
The girl who never comes here.
The girl who remains shut up in that library.
I couldn't stop thinking about that girl.
Shiona's voice snapped me back to reality.
"Sorry, I was just lost in thought."
"I see... everyone's already gone home, you know."
Looking around, the people who had been in such a large circle were now scattered.
It seemed I had been lost in thought for a very long time.
"What were you thinking about?"
"Hmm... no... it's nothing..."
"Shall I guess? It's about Tippy, isn't it?"
She saw right through me so easily. So I nodded honestly.
"...Yeah, it is."
"I knew it... are you really that worried about her?"
"Yeah, I'm worried. She's still such a little kid, after all."
"A little kid, huh... I guess so."
"And she's always all alone. There's no way she isn't lonely."
"But she's always been like that. She's used to it by now."
"That's not true."
"After all, you said it yourself, Shiona. That the townspeople have changed since I came."
"Yeah, that's true..."
"Then I want Tippy to change too. It's not right for her to stay lonely."
I repeated what Shiona had taught me, as if returning the favor.
Hearing those words, Shiona's smile clouded over slightly.
She looked towards the library, pursed her lips for a moment, and then turned back to me with a smile.
"Let's go home, Rei?"
"It's going to rain from noon today. Come on, let's go... okay? I'll make that fluffy white soup."
Taking Shiona's hand, I was more or less forcibly pulled away from the plaza.
Then, a few hours later.
Shiona called out to me again as I was about to leave the house.
"Um, I was thinking I'd like to read a book..."
"If it's books you want, my brother has a few he used to read."
"Not those... well, it's a genre of book that I'm sure isn't here."
"What kind of genre is it?"
"Books about machines. I've been interested ever since I fixed Mad's the other day."
"I see. I'm glad you're taking an interest in something, Rei."
"Yeah, thanks. So, I'm going to go to the library."
"Does it have to be today?"
"Yeah, sooner is better. I want to read it as soon as possible."
"But it's going to rain soon, you know?"
"The weather doesn't matter. I'll go even if it rains."
"But the books might get wet, you know?"
"It's okay, I'll take a bag with me."
"Hmm... then I'll go and borrow it for you."
"Huh? No, it's fine, I'll go myself."
"No, it's okay. I have some shopping to do anyway, so I'll go while I'm at it."
Saying that, Shiona returned to her room.
Why is that?
I feel like Shiona is trying to keep me away from the library.
No, that's not it.
It would probably be more accurate to say she's keeping me away from Tippy.
I don't know what that means, but it seems like she really doesn't want us to meet.
Shiona says it calmly, but I can feel her feelings.
But, why on earth?
"I'm ready, Rei. What kind of book should I borrow?"
"You probably wouldn't understand even if I told you, so I'll go with you."
"No, it's okay. You just relax, Rei."
"Then... I want you to borrow a book with electronic circuits in it."
"Electronic circuits, got it. Well then, I'm off."
Shiona went out.
I waited for several minutes.
It's probably about time Shiona is out of sight.
I reached for the door leading outside.
...That's strange.
It's not locked.
But the door wouldn't open no matter what I did.
It's as if it's bolted from the outside.
--Could it be, that's what's happening?
When Shiona left, she locked a lock that can only be locked from the outside, without me noticing.
That's why I can't get out of this door.
--But, why?
--For what purpose?
I returned to the living room, holding my head.
When I glanced at the table, there was a piece of paper that hadn't been there before.
It's a note from Shiona.
To Rei,
I think you were surprised that it was locked.
Do you remember me telling you that a nearby town was attacked?
So, I'm locking the door as a precaution.
Please stay put, okay?
I've prepared soup and bread for your meal.
Please heat it up and eat it.
Make sure you never go outside.
I've heard stories about humans who repeat plunder from that dead young man too.
Perhaps those humans are coming near here.
If that's the case, going outside is dangerous.
I see. Shiona was worried about me.
But, if that's the case, then it's dangerous for Shiona to go outside too.
Shouldn't I, as a man, have gone shopping instead?
--I can't deceive myself....
It's certainly true that there are humans who plunder.
Even so, is it necessary to lock the door from the outside?
Rather, if it's locked from the outside, then the key to open it can also be used from the outside.
Entry into the house becomes easier.
--That's strange.
If she was really wary of humans who plunder, she wouldn't have sung in the plaza yesterday.
She wouldn't do something that would intentionally gather people.
If that's the case, then why?
--There's only one thing I can think of.
She locked me in.
To keep me away from Tipi.
There's no way Shiona would do something like this without thinking.
There's definitely a reason.
And I'm sure it's something she's doing for my sake.
...Could something have happened to Tipi?
Is she trying to keep it from me?
Something that's not good for me... so I won't be sad knowing about it...
I couldn't sit still anymore.
I want to see Tipi. I want to make sure she's okay.
A blue-haired girl, crying alone in the library.
I wanted to wipe away that girl's tears.
I look around inside the church.
There was a window quite high up.
Even if I could climb up, there's no guarantee I could get outside and down safely.
But that's the only way to get out of here.
Suddenly, a white cloth caught my eye.
A curtain swaying in the wind.
There are several of them in the room, long, large, and sturdy-looking to cover the large windows.
I start taking down the curtains from all the windows.
There's no sign of sunlight pouring down from the sky, which is covered in dark clouds.
Tying the five curtains together on the table made them quite long.
It's long enough to reach down to the first floor.
I tie the end of the curtain to the window lattice.
I wrapped it around several times, checking the strength repeatedly.
It's okay.
It should be able to support my weight alone.
I tie the other end of the curtain to myself.
And with resolve, I leaned my body out of the window.
The ground visible from there looks very far away.
I feel a little faint, but I can't back down now.
Gripping the curtain tightly, I slowly lower my body.
Partway down, a strong gust of wind shook me.
As my body swung like a pendulum, I could barely manage to cling to the curtain.
I waited several minutes for the wind to die down.
I took one big, deep breath and resumed lowering my body.
It probably took a good ten minutes before my feet finally reached the ground.
My body was so exhausted that I almost collapsed onto my backside.
But I don't have time to rest here.
I started walking towards the library where the blue-haired girl is waiting.
As if to obstruct my feelings, rain quietly begins to fall.
As if to moisten the parched town, its intensity gradually increases.
Not caring about getting wet, I, without an umbrella, continue to walk forward.
The wet clothes clung to my skin, bringing me an unpleasant sensation.
I sheltered my right hand, covered by a glove, from the rain.
Puddles began to form at my feet, and distant thunder could be heard.
My rough breaths occasionally carried rainwater into my mouth.
In contrast to my hot body, cold rain lashed at me from the outside.
Spitting the rusty-tasting rain from my mouth, I finally arrived.
At the library where the blue-haired girl waits alone.
The inside is dimly lit, and no light leaks out at all.
Is she buried alone again in that dark sea of books?
Just thinking about it, my chest ached terribly.
I entered the entrance and proceeded deep inside, where the blue-haired girl was waiting.
"You came after all..."
A voice reached me from the depths.
It wasn't Tipi's.
It was the very person who kept me away from here--.
"I wrote in the note that it's dangerous outside, so you shouldn't go out, right? Or perhaps, you didn't see it?"
"No, I saw it."
"I see... So you knew and came anyway. Rei is a bad boy."
Fufu, Shiona's laughter could be heard.
But her expression wasn't clearly visible in the dimly lit hall.
"Why did you lock me up?"
"Lock you up...? Well, I guess that's how it turned out. I'm sorry."
"There's a reason, isn't there? Would you mind telling me if you're okay with it?"
"...Reason? The reason is simple. I don't want you to see her."
"You don't want me to see her...?"
"The blue-haired girl up ahead."
"Tipi? Why?"
"I can't tell you that. It's top secret."
"Wait, I don't understand what you're saying. Why can't I see Tipi?"
"That's... because it's not allowed."
"That's not a reason! Tell me properly."
"I can't tell you the reason."
I couldn't help but raise my voice.
At the same time, I realized that my chest was burning red and hot.
Is this "anger?"
Am I feeling anger towards Shiona...?
I don't mean to. I just want her to tell me the truth.
But my words just now seemed to have upset Shiona.
I can't see her expression clearly in the darkness, but the atmosphere coming from her has changed.
An air of hesitation, as if she's struggling to say something.
Shiona opened her mouth slightly, as if to say something... but then closed it again.
Then, tilting her chin down as if to look down, she whispered the words.
"...Because it will lead to unhappiness."
"Unhappiness? Who?"
"...Ray, me... and everyone living in this town, I guess."
"The people in town? Because we meet? I don't know what you're talking about."
"Certainly, you may not understand now. But I'm sure you'll regret it later."
"Why would I regret it? Hey, Shiona, tell me clearly. I'm not very smart, so I don't understand. Unless you tell me clearly..."
"In other words, it's like this..."
The sound of boots.
In the dimly lit entrance, Shiona approaches me.
The next moment, I felt warmth.
And, softness.
Shiona was hugging me.
"Shiona... eh? W-what..."
"Please, Ray... won't you just go home with me like this?"
"Like this...? What do you mean?"
"It's really not good for Ray and Tipi to meet. To be precise, if you meet, a chain of bad things will happen. So..."
"Could it be that I made Tipi angry? Is that why she doesn't want to see me, or something like that?"
"No, it's the opposite. Tipi loves Ray very much."
"Then--"
"That's why, we can't meet. Please, understand."
The arms Shiona had wrapped around my waist tightened.
A sweet fragrance enveloped my entire body, making my head spin.
"...Is that, Shiona's wish?"
"Yes, it is. It's my heartfelt wish."
"If I were to meet Tipi, what would Shiona think?"
"I would be very, very sad. I think I would feel blue and prickly."
"Why? Why does Shiona feel that way?"
Shiona pulled her face away from me and looked up at me with upturned eyes...
She said, as if she had made up her mind.
"Ray... because I love you."
"L-love...?"
Those words nearly made my mind grind to a halt.
Sweet breath.
Lips that seemed about to touch.
Hands around my waist.
The warmth of our bodies touching.
We were as close as we could possibly be.
And, those words just now.
It was just a word formed by connecting two simple characters, yet it was filled with such deep emotion.
These words were filling my heart with incredible force.
I was feeling an unprecedented level of 'joy'.
To be needed by someone. To have a certain someone pour a certain amount of affection into you.
I know no greater joy than this.
And now, I am about to obtain that joy.
I put my limp arms around Shiona's back.
Shiona accepts it.
A warmth grows deep within my chest.
"Shiona, I..."
"Yes, Ray. I understand. That's why, let's go home..."
Shiona's hand is linked with mine.
I turned on my heel and started walking towards the library exit.
"...Thank you, Ray. But you know, this is for the best. Because this is for your sake."
I felt a sense of unease at Shiona's words.
Shiona called out to me, looking puzzled, as I suddenly stopped walking.
"Shiona, you just said, 'for my sake,' right?"
"Yes, I certainly did say that."
"No, Shiona, that's not right."
"Not right? What's not right, Ray?"
"If you're saying it's for my sake, then this isn't right."
"It's not wrong. Doing this is for your sake, Ray."
"It is wrong. Because, I'm happy when I can be of use to someone. I'm here to be of use to someone. But now, I'm trying to disappear from the person I can be of use to. That's not my joy, and it's not for my sake. So, who is this for, then?"
"Shiona, I'm going to Tipi's place. It's for no one else, it's for myself. If someone ends up unhappy because of this, then it's my fault. But, even if that's how it turns out, I won't stop. Because that's the result I wanted."
I released Shiona's hand, and once again pushed forward through the entrance.
Shiona's voice didn't reach my back.
Shiona just stared silently, without saying a word, with a sad expression as she watched me.
I passed through the rain-scented entrance and moved deeper into the library.
I could feel the moisture on the soles of my shoes being absorbed into the carpet with each step.
The dry library air clung to my wet skin.
I continued to feel inexplicably unwell.
That might be related to what happened with Shiona just now.
The depths of my chest ached, as if I had swallowed something heavy.
Shiona's face flashed through my mind again and again.
Every one of them, wearing a sad smile.
Why did things turn out this way?
Why did I do such a thing?
A wave of regret washed over me.
But, I couldn't stop walking.
--That girl is further in.
A girl who is always alone.
A girl who is always blue.
A girl who is always shedding tears.
I couldn't bring myself to leave that girl alone.
That's why I'm walking down this hallway.
Paintings were hung on the walls of the hallway.
These were the paintings that Tipi apparently drew, one each day.
In the paintings drawn on brand new paper, a single girl was depicted.
I immediately knew who that girl was.
A girl drawn small and alone within the large paper.
Tears streamed down her cheeks.
All of the recent paintings had the same composition.
A painting of a solitary girl crying.
Seeing those paintings, my chest ached terribly.
The girl had always been alone.
I felt like I understood that sadness.
I wanted to quickly wipe away that sadness.
I wanted to tell her that she wasn't alone.
I wanted to tell her that I was by her side.
Dragging my wet soles, I proceeded down the long hallway.
As I gazed at the paintings hung at a height Tipi could reach, I continued forward.
At that moment, I suddenly felt a sense of incongruity.
It wasn't because of the content of the paintings.
The problem was the number of paintings.
No matter how you looked at it, Tipi was a very young girl.
Even if that child drew a picture every day, could she really have drawn this many?
...Perhaps there were days when she drew several pictures in a single day.
Even so, the number of these paintings was impossible.
Was the girl that lonely?
Did she have nothing else to do but draw?
Ah, why did I leave the girl alone?
How many tears did I make her shed because of that?
The amount of tears in the paintings increased with each passing day.
It seemed to represent how the girl's sadness was deepening.
I hurried.
To the girl who was probably crying alone in the depths of this place.
In order to heal that sadness.
And to wipe away those tears.
The girl...to embrace her body in these two hands.
I walked as quickly as I could, to the deepest part of the library, until I was out of breath.
The girl was not where she always should have been.
Her bear plush, which she always kept close, wasn't there either.
All that remained were an unfinished drawing and crayons.
The unfinished drawing depicted a girl crying all alone.
Where could Tipi have gone?
I searched the surrounding bookshelves, but she was nowhere to be found.
Could she be somewhere in this library?
Or perhaps outside of it?
The truth is unknown.
I won't know until I try to find Tipi.
I started walking.
Weaving through the bookshelves, I searched for the blue-haired girl.
The vast library grounds were not suited for finding someone.
And to make matters worse, it was so dark.
Just looking from the edge of the bookshelves wouldn't be enough to find her.
I would have to check step by step, with my own feet.
I walked between the bookshelves from the back of the library towards the entrance.
Before I knew it, the clothes that had been wet were starting to dry.
And by the time my hair was completely dry...
I finally managed to find the girl.
The girl was on a large stepladder, arranging books on the shelf.
The girl is a resident of this library, and also serves as a librarian.
She must be returning the books that the townspeople have returned to their original locations.
It's a harsh task for this little girl.
The thousands of bookshelves in this library are stacked to the height of the ceiling and connected to each other.
I don't even want to think about the number of all the books in the collection, it's terrifying.
The girl faces such a large number of books and manages them like this every day.
All alone, inside this library.
Thinking about that, for some reason, I couldn't help but feel a tightening in the depths of my chest.
Tipi stretched on the stepladder, returning a book bigger than her face to the shelf.
After finishing that task and taking a breather, Tipi turned her face towards me.
"...Rei! ...W-w-w-w-wah..."
Noticing my presence, Tipi lost her balance on the stepladder.
"Look out, Tipi!!"
The stepladder fell over.
Tipi's hand reached out.
Responding to that hand, I stretched out both of my hands.
--The impact pierced through my chest to my back.
When I realized it, I was holding Tipi in my arms, having fallen onto the floor on my back.
"Rei... you came for me, Rei...!!"
Tipi was nuzzling against my chest over and over.
Relieved, I stroked Tipi's head.
Her soft hair welcomed my hand.
"Tipi, are you hurt anywhere? Are you injured?"
"I'm okay. Does Rei hurt anywhere?"
"I'm fine. Thank you for your concern."
"You saved Tipi... Rei, I love you..."
The little girl's hands gripped my clothes tightly.
I felt a slightly wet and warm sensation on my chest.
Tipi is shedding tears.
But they seemed like different tears than usual.
Surely, they are tears of relief.
I must be able to lighten Tipi's heart a little by being here.
Thinking that, joy rushed through me.
"Tipi was arranging books. I'm a good girl, right? Good girl?"
"Yes, you're a good girl. A very good girl."
"Hey, pet me. Because I'm a good girl, pet Tipi's head."
"Yeah... Tipi is a good girl, a good girl..."
I stroked her silky hair.
"Yay... Rei is petting my head. Tipi is so happy..."
"Do you always arrange books?"
"Yeah. I'm repairing the books. Because I want lots of people to read them."
I look up at the bookshelf.
Certainly, some of the books are quite old.
Some have worn spines, and others are discolored.
Tipi is repairing these...?
I remember wetting the books in the rain.
If I handle them roughly, I'll end up increasing Tipi's work like this.
I vowed from the bottom of my heart to treat them with care.
I sit up and lean my back against a nearby bookshelf.
"Sorry I'm late."
"It's okay... Rei came here like this, after all."
"Were you okay by yourself?"
"N-no... I was very, very lonely."
"Were you crying?"
"Yeah... yeah, yeah..."
Tipi presses her face against my chest.
Occasionally, I could hear her sobbing.
"It's okay, I'll be with you from now on."
"Always? Rei, will you stay with Tipi?"
"Yeah, that's right. I'll try to come to the library as much as possible."
"Won't you stay with me?"
Tipi raised her face.
Large tears were welling up in her eyes.
"That's a little difficult. I'm currently being taken care of by Shiona."
"But, I'll come every day. That should make you less lonely, right?"
"Yeah... but, the nights are so lonely."
"The nights, huh..."
"It's dark and quiet... Sometimes Tipi thinks she might be all alone in the world."
"That's not true. That's not true at all..."
All I could do was hug Tipi.
A sweet fragrance emanated from Tipi.
A sweet fragrance different from Shiona's.
"Yeah, I know... Just you coming here like this makes Tipi happy. Hey, Rei. Is it okay if I ask you something?"
"Yeah, what is it? Tipi."
"Will you help me?"
"Yeah... of course, it's the least I can do."
I stood up and took Tipi's hand.
Pushing a cart filled with several books, we strolled through the library.
"Next... um, a book called 'The Philosophy of Mind and Body'"
"If that's the one, it's Easy 493, third shelf from the top, thirteenth book from the right."
As soon as I said the title of the book, Tipi immediately spoke the location.
It was as if she knew every single book in this library.
In the place she told me, there was indeed a gap for one book.
When I inserted it, it fit perfectly.
Tipi wasn't just saying things randomly.
She was pointing out the location of the book with certainty.
I became interested and decided to ask a slightly mischievous question.
"Hey Tipi, can I ask you something?"
"Do you remember the opening part of this novel?"
What I presented was a rather old-fashioned novel.
Tipi stared intently at the title, and began to recite as if opening a book in her mind.
"'Looking down, there was a height of five stories. Cream-colored bricks were laid right next to the school building, creating a walkway that looked pleasant to stroll along. Right next to the walkway was a flower bed, and even from this height, you could see the colorful flowers. If I were to throw myself from here, would the cream color and the flowers all be stained with my dirty blood?'"
Tipi recited it word for word, without a single mistake.
It matched the handwritten text in the novel perfectly.
"Could it be that you remember all the books here?"
"Hmm... I don't know."
"Then, what about this book?"
After glancing at the book I presented, Tipi began to recite fluently.
"'The human body is composed of approximately 206 bones, starting from the head with the occipital bone, frontal bone, temporal bone, parietal bone, sphenoid bone, ethmoid bone, malleus, incus, stapes, inferior nasal concha, lacrimal bone, nasal bone, vomer, maxilla, palatine bone, zygomatic bone, mandible, hyoid bone, then connecting to the cervical vertebrae, thoracic vertebrae, lumbar vertebrae, sacral vertebrae, coccygeal vertebrae, ribs, and spreading to the sternum.'"
"...Then, what about this one?"
I presented another handwritten book, this one titled "The Complete Pi Encyclopedia."
"What's the opening of this 'Soulless Child Theory'?"
"'All things are finite, and even the soul is no exception. A child born after the soul has withered will be a soulless vessel. - Edward Morgue'"
Tipi has memorized all the books here.
But, why?
Even with an incredible memory, she would first need to read all these books.
Even if she read every day, she could never finish reading this sea of books.
What on earth is going on...?
"Rei, what's wrong?"
"No, it's nothing. Come on, let's put the next book away."
There's no point in thinking about something I can't figure out.
For now, I'll focus on helping Tipi with her work.
After returning all the books to the shelves, we sat down in our usual spot.
"Rei, thank you for helping me."
Tipi is being even more affectionate with me than usual.
Is it a reaction to not being able to see me until now?
The way she clings to me is cute and endearing.
"It's okay, Tipi. You always do this by yourself, right?"
"Yeah... I'm always, always alone. I'm lonely."
"...Since when have you been alone?"
That might have been a forbidden question.
Tipi looked up at me sadly.
"Tipi has been alone for a long, long time."
And then, Tipi told me her story.
A sad tale of how Tipi came to be alone.
"Papa, Mama!"
It was a story from when Tipi's parents were still in the library.
The girl loved them dearly.
She loved her kind mother and father so much.
Her mother was always smiling and would gently hug Tipi.
Her father was always organizing books, watching the two of them with a gentle gaze.
"Tipi is still such a spoiled child."
Her father took out an electronic device for books from the desk.
"Oh, that's right. Tipi liked this one better, didn't she?"
He put away the electronic device with a wry smile, and instead took out a "book" made of paper.
The technology of printing had already become obsolete, and now it was a precious cultural relic.
"Welcome, Tipi-chan."
Called onto her mother's lap, she happily sat down.
And on Tipi's lap was a bear plushie that her parents had chosen for her.
Tipi enjoyed every day.
She enjoyed the days she spent with her beloved mother and father.
And there wasn't a day she didn't feel happy.
Her mother always praised the pictures Tipi drew.
"She's sure to be an artist someday. I'm so proud, Father."
Her father always had hope for Tipi's future.
If only those days could last forever.
If only the three of them could stay together like this forever.
Tipi always thought so.
Before she knew it, the days when her parents frowned increased.
Tipi didn't like that expression.
The town also seemed restless.
The adults were all talking about something, all saying the same thing.
But the young Tipi didn't understand what it meant.
She only felt a growing anxiety that their life as it was would be destroyed.
One day, the phone rang.
To Tipi, that sound sounded very sad.
Her father, who answered the phone, began to frown.
That expression that Tipi didn't like.
Her father, after hanging up the phone, was talking about something with her mother.
After a while, that talk turned into an argument.
They were arguing about something.
The only thing I understood was that watching the two of them argue was very sad.
"Tipi, will you listen to me?"
After a while, her mother looked at Tipi with a serious expression.
Behind her was her father--and packed luggage.
Tipi intuitively realized that their life as it was would not continue.
"Right now, terrible things are happening in the world."
"Many people are scared and can't sleep at night. Tipi wouldn't want that, would she?"
"There are children all over the world who feel that way. Your mother wants to help them if she can."
"Yes... I knew Tipi would say that... So, Tipi, what I'm about to say is important. It's okay if you don't understand, but will you listen?"
"Actually, your father and I have to go far away to help those children. Even if we go, we may not be able to change the situation... But there is a possibility."
"No. Much, much farther. It's so far that it would take days or weeks to get there."
Her father stopped Tipi as she was about to go to her room.
"Tipi doesn't need to pack for the trip."
"That's not it... Actually, Tipi, your father and mother are going to that place alone."
"Alone...? What about Tipi...?"
Her parents exchanged glances.
Tipi sensed something from her parents' sad faces.
Suddenly, tears began to flow.
"I'm sorry, Tipi, but we can't do that."
"The place your mother and I are going is very dangerous. We don't want to take you to such a dangerous place. Your mother and father care about you, Tipi."
"No... I don't want to... I don't want to! Tipi's going too..."
Her parents gently hugged Tipi.
"I'm sorry, Tipi... But your mother and I still have to go."
"I'm sorry, Tipi... It'll be okay, we'll definitely be back soon."
"We'll be back really soon... So you won't be lonely, we'll come back right away..."
"Tipi, be a good girl and stay home. And show us your drawings again when we get back."
"Oh, that's right. Draw one picture every day. What you saw, what you heard, what you learned, what you felt. When we get back, will you tell us about it?"
"That's right. I'll also make a lot of stories into books on my trip. I'll come back to tell them to Tipi."
"Yes, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. I promise, so..."
The three family members hugged each other.
To heal the parting, which they didn't know how long it would last--.
How much time had passed since then?
Tipi continued to draw, just as her father had told her.
Each time she finished a drawing, she would stick it on the wall. So that her parents would see it right away when they came home.
What she saw...
What she heard...
What she learned...
What she felt...
But that was soon filled with thoughts of her parents.
I want them to hold me, to pat my head, to call my name, quickly... I want to see them...
My heart is dyed blue, a deep blue.
The girl continued to draw, tears streaming down her face...
Tipi told me about her sad past, shedding blue tears of sorrow.
Her small shoulders were trembling faintly.
A girl enduring sorrow before my very eyes.
I can't possibly fathom how great her sorrow is.
Probably because I've never felt such sorrow before.
That's why I can't understand Tipi's feelings.
But I should be able to heal her sorrow.
By holding her small body close.
Surely.
Tipi sat with her back against the wall.
I reached out to her delicate body.
When I touched her shoulder, Tipi's body jumped slightly.
It wasn't rejection.
She just seemed a little surprised by the sudden action in the darkness.
"It's okay, Tipi. It's okay."
"Hey, Rei, you won't disappear from Tipi's side, will you?"
"Yeah, I won't disappear."
"You won't leave Tipi alone?"
"Yeah, I won't leave you alone."
"You won't make Tipi lonely?"
"Yeah, I won't make you lonely."
"You won't make Tipi sad?"
"Yeah, I won't make you sad."
"You'll cherish Tipi?"
"Yeah, I'll cherish you."
"You'll hold Tipi close?"
"Yeah, I'll hold you close."
"You'll carry Tipi?"
"Yeah, I'll carry you."
"You'll pat Tipi's head?"
"Yeah, I'll pat your head."
"You'll hold Tipi's hand?"
"Yeah, I'll hold your hand."
"You'll stay with Tipi forever?"
Tipi's eyes glimmered faintly in the darkness.
The shoulder I touched was burning with a feverish heat.
I embraced Tipi tightly--.
"Oh, you two are getting along well."
The voice that echoed in the darkness didn't belong to the girl who was just trying to heal her sadness.
It was Shiona, who I was supposed to have parted ways with at the entrance.
Before I knew it, Shiona was standing beside me.
With a smile that I could make out even in the dim light, Shiona approached us directly.
"But you know, being too close is also a problem. You're a young man and woman, after all."
Shiona restrained the hand I had extended toward Tipi.
"Y-You're...".
Tipi's face, which had been seeking that arm, twisted in sadness.
I couldn't help but raise my voice at Shiona.
"Shiona, what are you doing!"
"What's wrong? Why are you so agitated? You have to consider the implications of physical contact with someone of the opposite sex."
"That's not it. Tipi is sad... I'm just trying to heal her sadness, even a little."
"Sad? About what?"
"About her parents not coming home yet! Tipi has always been all alone. She's been feeling lonely all this time!"
"That's reality, so it can't be helped."
"Can't be helped? What does that even mean..."
Shiona walked up to Tipi.
And then, she looked at Tipi, who was small and grieving.
"Tipi-chan? It's unfortunate, but Tipi-chan will always be all alone, you know? Always has been, and always will be."
She said that with a smile, in her usual tone.
"Shiona, what are you saying..."
"Tipi-chan, you understand too, right? Your mom and dad aren't coming back anymore, are they?"
"Shiona... stop it... stop saying such cruel things..."
"You've realized it already, haven't you? You just don't want to admit it."
"...No... no... I don't want to..."
"Tipi-chan's mom and dad..."
"...Shiona... stop..."
"Are already de──"
"Stop ittttttt!!"
My voice echoed through the library.
My whole body was burning up.
My breathing became ragged, and I felt a pain deep in my head.
My clenched teeth were also grinding and groaning.
My vision flickered, and I could barely stand.
And at the same time, I was certain.
My chest felt red and prickly. The feeling that Mad always had.
This is the emotion called 'anger'.
I'm feeling anger at the injustice happening before my eyes.
Now, the blue-haired girl's hope has been severed.
Tipi was hurt by Shiona's heartless words.
Tipi is crying with a voiceless voice.
Her face is all crumpled up.
Turning her sadness into large drops, letting them flow down her cheeks.
With her young body, she desperately conveys her bottomless sorrow.
Shiona added insult to injury.
"Because it's true, right? How long do you think it's been since your mom and dad came home, Tipi-chan?"
"Tipi-chan, you draw pictures every day, right? How many is it now?"
"Stop it..."
"Doesn't it make you sad to draw every day? How many more pictures do you have to draw before your mom and dad come back?"
"Sto-op it..."
"It's useless no matter how much you cry. Tears only flow to comfort yourself. Just because they flow doesn't mean anything will change."
"...Please stop..."
"That's just self-satisfaction. You're only crying because you know someone will be nice to you if you cry. That's just running away from reality."
"...Plea-se stop..."
"It's time you realized. Your mom and dad aren't coming back. Never again. Tipi-chan will never be able to see her mom and dad again."
"Also, let me tell you. Rei is only here because he pities you, Tipi-chan. He doesn't have the love that your mom and dad poured into you. Only pity is binding Rei here. Do you understand, Tipi-chan? You're all alone."
"Stop ittttttttttt──"
An angry roar echoed.
When that voice echoing off the walls stopped, only Tipi's sobs remained.
Tipi looks up at Shiona with vacant eyes.
I felt like the light she had just a little while ago had disappeared.
"Rei, spoiling someone and comforting them are two different things."
"That's not true... that's not true..."
"Rei, you need to accept reality too. Tipi-chan's parents are no longer in this world."
"No... that's not true..."
"Then why haven't they contacted her even once? Not even a single letter to Tipi-chan, who they doted on and loved so much?"
"That's... surely, they're just too busy to find the time to contact her..."
"If they knew the other person was worried, they wouldn't begrudge the time. Especially if it's their beloved child. The fact that they haven't means—"
"Stop it... please, stop it..."
"—Tipi-chan's mom and dad are already dead."
I froze.
Shiona's tone was as gentle as usual, and her smile was the same as always.
I wish she would have said it in a cold, emotionless voice.
In that abnormal atmosphere, I couldn't say anything more.
Shiona's face is smiling as she turns to face Tipi again.
"Tipi-chan, your only family is your mom and dad. But those two aren't coming back anymore. That's why no matter who you're with, you'll never be truly fulfilled. Even if Rei is with you, you can't become a family. That's an unchangeable fact now. You'll always be alone."
Shiona turns on her heel and heads towards the entrance.
On the way, she turns back towards me just once.
But her gaze remained fixed on the floor.
"Rei... it's all for your sake,"
Shiona said, leaving those words behind as she exited the library.
Silence filled the hall.
Now, even Tipi's sobs had ceased.
I was furious and drained by Shiona's words and actions.
I couldn't even stand up.
But I couldn't leave the girl alone like this.
The girl must be thinking.
That she's all alone in the world.
That she has to live in solitude.
I didn't want her to think that way.
I wanted her to know she wasn't alone.
My feelings for Tipi aren't pity.
It's definitely not pity.
I repeat it over and over again.
As if telling myself, over and over again.
I reach out and place my hand on Tipi's shoulder.
I pull her delicate shoulders close.
Tipi flinched at first, surprised, but then settled against my chest.
She presses her face against me, stifling her sobs.
I gently stroked her trembling shoulders again and again.
If only I could alleviate even a little of the sorrow she holds in that small body...
I don't know how long we stayed like that.
We sat there, nestled close to each other.
After a while, when I'd lost all sense of time.
Tipi got up unsteadily and started walking as if searching for something.
Tipi doesn't respond.
A sketchbook and crayons.
Tipi comes back to me with those two items.
She sits down, leaning her back against my stomach.
Tipi still doesn't respond.
Instead, she flips through the pages of the sketchbook.
Using the fresh page as her canvas, Tipi picks up a crayon.
And without hesitation, she runs the crayon across the paper.
What she draws is a cute, age-appropriate picture.
The first thing she drew was a picture of a blue girl.
There are tear tracks on her cheeks.
Her eyes are tinged with red.
I gently stroked Tipi's head.
Lowering her gaze again, Tipi runs the crayon across the paper.
Next, it seems she's drawing me.
My hand is placed on the girl's head.
It seems to be a scene of me gently stroking her head.
And then--
It was Shiona.
She's watching the girl from a short distance away with a scary look on her face.
That's what Shiona is to Tipi.
Even from my perspective, Shiona in front of Tipi probably looks like that in a picture.
Why did Shiona do such a thing?
Shiona said it.
That it was all for my sake.
I don't understand what that means.
No, I didn't want to understand.
I don't understand what 'for my sake' means when it makes Tipi cry.
Can I be happy by making someone else unhappy?
No, there's no way that could happen.
It's something that shouldn't happen.
As if to erase Shiona's words that are stuck in my ears, I hug Tipi.
Her voice is faint and about to disappear.
But deep down, I felt a little bit of joy.
I think as I look at the picture.
Could this be Tipi's way of avoiding sadness?
It's said that people dream at the end of the day.
That's said to be in order to organize the memories of the day's events.
For Tipi, maybe this picture is that.
The events of the day--
Including the good and the bad, she draws everything in a picture.
By doing so, she organizes her memories and calms her heart, perhaps.
In fact, Tipi's expression has softened somewhat.
As the picture progresses, her sadness eases.
As if she's handing over her sadness to the picture.
Tipi, having stood up, took my hand.
Following her lead, I arrive at a wall covered in pictures.
Pictures she says she draws one a day.
The number of pictures was enormous.
Tipi pasted the picture she drew today at the very edge.
Another picture of Tipi's has been added.
The wall full of pictures felt like a diary showing this girl's loneliness.
Tipi must have spent her time alone on this story.
To think she's been dealing with such a sad story all alone...
Thinking that, something welled up from the depths of my heart.
Looking into those sorrowful eyes, I unintentionally choked up.
Instead of answering, I embraced Tipi.
After a while, I could hear her soft breathing.
I compared Tipi, asleep in my arms, to the picture diary on the wall.
Could this picture book perhaps be Tipi's heart itself?
Thinking such things, I fell asleep.
This is the church where I live.
I stand before the familiar white, large doors.
I pushed open those doors with both hands.
The chapel that continues inside is enveloped in astonishing silence.
--No, it's not complete silence.
Because the sound of quiet sobbing reached my ears.
I push forward into the chapel.
Then, I came face to face with the person who was sobbing.
It was someone who never let their smile fade.
It was Shiona.
Shiona was crying, her delicate shoulders trembling.
I couldn't hide my surprise at that.
--Why are you crying?
I didn't understand the reason.
But, the fact is that Shiona is crying in front of me.
Those tears are not fake.
Even so, there was nothing I could do.
...No, that's not true.
There must be something I can do.
I reach out my hand.
My fingertips were reaching towards Shiona's eyes.
I don't think I can stop those tears.
But, I can wipe away the tears that have already fallen.
That's all I can do, but--.
I reach my fingertip towards a large drop.
Halfway there, my hand stopped.
My fingertips are made of machine.
The extended index finger has a metallic sheen...
That's right.
I had forgotten.
No, I wanted to forget.
I am not human.
I am a manufactured being.
Why is this happening?
Am I not even allowed to wipe away the tears of someone I care about?
Shiona is crying.
She continues to shed tears.
Is this a sadness that Shiona has never shown before?
But, I can't stop or wipe away those endlessly flowing tears.
Then, why am I here?
Being here, what can I do for Shiona?
I couldn't find the answer.
I couldn't move my outstretched mechanical hand any further...
--Immediately after, a dissonant sound of metal scraping against metal echoed around us.
The ear-splitting sound echoed intermittently.
Or so I thought, my outstretched fingertip--.
That part crumbled and fell to the floor.
The collapse, which began at the fingertip, increased its range to the palm--wrist--arm--shoulder.
Parts all over my body are collapsing and falling off.
Before long, it became difficult for me to even stand there, and I fell to the floor.
My legs, my torso, are turning into scrap.
Scrap metal is piling up around me.
I couldn't even make a sound, and had no choice but to accept the collapse.
Shiona is still crying.
Crying silently.
I can no longer even extend my mechanical hand.
Because there's no longer even an arm or fingertip there.
The collapse corrodes my entire body, reaching even my head.
I don't feel any pain.
I shouldn't feel any.
But...
I felt a pain deep within my chest, a chest that should no longer exist.
The last thing I saw as my vision crumbled away was Shiona's sad expression and tears.
Eventually, I became just a pile of metal--.
A mountain of scrap.
--And then, I woke up.
I was shouting something, but I don't remember.
My breathing is ragged.
I hurriedly looked around.
A dimly lit, dusty space.
The lukewarm air clings stickily to me.
And thick books lined up on shelves.
This was the library.
I must have fallen asleep yesterday and woken up here this morning.
I hurriedly took off my gloves and checked my right hand.
The thing that should have crumbled just now was still there, unchanged.
But, just like in the dream, it's made of machine.
On my lap, Tipi was already fast asleep, snoring softly.
His innocent sleeping face doesn't betray any of yesterday's sadness.
It seems I was experiencing what humans call a dream.
During sleep mode, the memory banks are reorganized, so I sometimes catch glimpses of past records.
But what I just saw was probably a prediction based on experience and memory.
Does that mean this kind of possibility is hidden in the future... that's what was calculated?
Even so, how sad.
I still couldn't calm the unrest deep within my chest.
Why do Shiona's tears shake me up this much?
And why am I so powerless?
I am not real.
I knew that.
I thought I knew that.
But even so, I want to make them laugh.
I want to make Shiona, Tipi, and everyone in town laugh.
But, I can't do it.
I have an idea why, but I don't want to admit it.
--It's because I'm artificial.
The one truth I can't resist, no matter what.
But even so, I wished for it.
I want to make everyone around me smile.
And yet, I can't make it happen.
When I try to make Tipi smile, Shiona won't smile.
When I try to make Shiona smile, I can't wipe away Tipi's tears.
How difficult it is.
Isn't there a better way to make everyone smile?
While looking at Tipi's sad sleeping face, I repeated it over and over in my heart.
I stroke Tipi's head with my fingertip.
His smooth hair lets my fingertip pass through to the ends without tangling.
A sweet scent spreads.
"Unn... unnn..."
Is he dreaming? Tipi let out a small voice.
Looking at his innocent sleeping face, my desire to protect him grows stronger.
But, how?
Alternating my gaze between my mechanical right hand and Tipi's face, I was at a loss.
I wished that this gentle time could last forever.
--But, it couldn't be.
A strange sound echoed from afar.
Footsteps echoed, as if many people were walking at the exact same time.
And, faintly, the sound of screams and something being destroyed.
Those two sounds crushed even my small hope.
I hurriedly put on my glove on my right hand.
"W-What... Rei, what is it...?"
Tipi woke up to the abnormality.
An anxious expression that wasn't there until just now spread across Tipi's face.
"I don't know... but it seems like something happened."
"Something? What something?"
"I have no idea. But I'm sure it's not good."
I stood up and pointed my toes towards the library aisle.
"...Rei? Where are you going?"
"I'm just going to check things out."
"No... don't go, Rei."
"It's okay, I'm not going anywhere. I'm just going to check things out on the roof for a little while."
"No... I don't want you to go..."
Tipi hugged me and shed tears.
She must be superimposing my disappeared parents' image onto me.
"It's okay. It's okay, Tipi."
"N-No... no..."
"Have I ever broken a promise with you, Tipi?"
"That's, that's right. Whenever you said you'd go see me, you always did, right?"
"So it's okay. I'll take a look from the roof and come right back."
"...Okay. But, come back quickly, okay?"
"Yeah, of course."
After making that promise with Tipi, I headed to the library roof.
I climbed the long spiral staircase and arrived in front of an old, rusted door.
There was no sign it had been used for a long time.
When I opened it, a grating, unpleasant sound echoed in my ears.
Without minding, I pushed the door open.
...At that very moment.
An anomaly jumped into my eyes.
Black smoke was rising from all over town.
The scream-like sounds weren't my imagination; they were coming from the mouths of townspeople fleeing from something.
And chasing after those townspeople were multiple figures clad in soiled cloaks.
Silently, they simply walked while holding firearms--yet, with efficient coordination, they were surely cornering the fleeing people.
It was as if everything was calculated, that kind of movement.
The townspeople cornered against the wall and the attackers are exchanging words.
The attackers exchange glances and nod to each other, then point the muzzle of their guns at the townspeople's heads.
And without showing a shred of hesitation, they pull the finger they had on the trigger.
With a dry sound, their head shook violently as if exploding, and the townspeople collapsed on the spot......
The sound snapped me back to reality, and I understood the situation.
It's hard to believe... but it seems this town is under attack.
What Shiona was saying was true after all...
I hurried back to the lobby.
Seeing me like that, Tipi asked anxiously.
"Rei... did something happen? You have a really scary look on your face."
"...I don't really know... but... something bad is happening..."
Unable to tell Tipi directly what I saw, I spoke vaguely.
"Something bad? What do you mean?"
"I think... this town is being attacked."
"No... Tipi's scared..."
"It's okay, it's far away in the town. It should still be safe here, so calm down."
"...Okay... but, what are we going to do?"
"I'm going to go and see what's happening."
I was worried about the town, but I was even more worried about Shiona.
Even though what happened yesterday, she's still a person who helped me.
I haven't even asked why Shiona, who is kind to everyone, is so harsh only to Tipi.
I still don't understand the meaning of her words that it was for my sake.
"No, don't go... please... Rei..."
"It's okay, Tipi. I'll definitely come back."
"Really? Really, really?"
"Yeah, of course. So, can you wait for me a little bit?"
"If you come back, Tipi will wait."
Tipi hugged her bear tightly.
Even so, the anxiety couldn't be erased from her expression.
Is there nothing I can do for this girl's sadness and anxiety?
Leaving the library with such a guilty feeling in my heart, I left the library.
I decided to use back streets as much as possible on the way to town.
What's happening in town is clearly not good.
There's a risk that I might suffer some damage if I'm found.
I headed to the plaza, trying to keep my footsteps as quiet as possible.
I wanted to arrive before the squad if possible, but it seemed impossible because I kept taking detours.
The closer I got to the center of town, the more broken buildings I noticed.
But those were all buildings that didn't seem like they would break until yesterday.
Were they destroyed by those strangers who were chasing the townspeople yesterday?
Dusty smoke drifts through the town that was beautiful until yesterday.
Why would they need to destroy the buildings in this peaceful town?
I just can't understand it.
Amidst the screams and the noise of buildings being destroyed, I arrived at the truth.
–The tragedy unfolding in the plaza.
Many men were chasing and capturing the townspeople.
Pointing guns and using unreasonable violence as a shield, they were driving men, women, and even children without discrimination.
The captured townspeople are being made to sit in the center of the plaza.
Children crying out. Inarticulate shouts of anger.
The armed men, not caring about those voices, have cool faces.
No, perhaps the expression 'cool faces' is wrong.
They had faces that showed no interest, like glancing at a stone lying on the roadside.
I can't see Shiona anywhere within my field of vision. I should assume she hasn't been captured yet...?
"--What's the situation?"
"--We've captured the majority of the residents. It's only a matter of time for the rest."
Nearby, I overheard two men talking.
Making sure they don't notice me, I slowly approached the two and eavesdropped.
"How are the water and food supplies?"
"They were sufficiently stocked. We even found an underground water source for the water."
"I see, so it's become a bigger harvest than expected."
"Yes, it's possible to settle here permanently."
I was certain.
These men are the humans who raided the town and stole water and food.
I just couldn't forgive their senselessness.
To hurt innocent people for the sake of mere plunder...
But, I couldn't do anything more than that.
I couldn't even jump out from that spot.
I knew better than anyone that I was powerless.
"Still, how did you find such a small town?"
"--There was that slave who escaped the other day, right?"
"If I remember correctly, he was advocating for coexistence with the Phloids..."
"Yes. A foolish man trapped in old-fashioned ideas. Coexistence and harmony with the Phloids... such useless thinking in this world."
--Coexistence and harmony...
That phrase brings to mind a certain young man.
The one I helped, brought to this town... and whose last words those were before he passed.
Does that mean these humans are the ones who inflicted those injuries on him?
"That's right, we treated him like a Phloid and kept him alive as labor."
"Indeed. Chasing after him to bring him back unexpectedly proved useful."
One of the men continued in a monotonous voice.
"After all, a human appeared to help that man and guided us to the town."
Hearing those words, I felt a chill run down my spine.
Why didn't I consider the cause of that young man's injuries back then?
I should have known from Shiona that there was a group carrying out looting...
Even when returning to town, if I had paid more attention to my surroundings, I might have avoided being followed.
I regret taking such rash actions on a momentary impulse.
I'm the one who created the cause of this raid──……it's me.
"We've finished gathering the town's leaders in one place. Zero resisters."
"I see. Then, select from among them those who are oral intake types and lack production or management abilities. Factors that reduce productivity are──"
As he said that, the man receiving the report pulled a pistol from his pocket.
"Dispose of them."
"--Stop!"
At the same moment I understood the meaning of those words, I shouted.
However, I couldn't help but shout at these humans who so casually said 'dispose' of the townspeople who had taken care of me.
With that, the men who were there turned around.
And, our eyes met.
"Secure him."
With that voice, the men rushed towards me.
In a panic, I started running.
But, my body isn't keeping up with my feelings.
My feet aren't moving properly, and I ended up running away while losing my balance.
The men are quickly closing in behind me.
Their movements are mechanically precise.
Damn, at this rate, I'll be caught.
It's now or never, I dashed into the back alley.
The back alley had several muddy spots due to the rain.
Even as my feet were getting caught, I kept running.
Occasionally, I knocked over lumber leaning against the wall, trying to slow the men down.
But, that wasn't enough to stop them.
I could tell the men were right behind me.
Can I really escape like this...?
The place I was aiming for was the library.
Even if I could make it to the library, Tippy's existence would be revealed to them.
If Tippy were to be attacked--.
I changed the direction of my toes.
I dashed into what seemed to be a back door of the nearest building.
Coincidentally, it was Mad's general store.
I searched for a place to hide--.
!?"
I found a figure sitting in a chair.
Mad didn't answer. Just like that day after he ran the projector, he sat shallowly in the chair with his arms crossed.
"Mad, you can hear me, right!? Stop joking around at a time like this, Mad-- Mad?"
I barely managed to swallow my scream.
The moment I touched Mad's shoulder, Mad--quietly collapsed from the chair. As if he were already dead.
Wh-Why--!
Did those men 'dispose' of him? But, there don't seem to be any external wounds.
Target acquired.
What snapped me out of my near panic was, ironically, the voices of the men who had been chasing me.
However, it was far too late.
We have enough manpower as it is, eliminate.
Unable to do anything, I just frantically jumped back from Mad, the men stepped in, and the lead man aimed his gun at me──
Rei!
Immediately after, several things happened at once.
A dry sound rang out, the sound of a gunshot.
And, a figure slid in front of me as if to protect me--.
Shio--
It took me a moment to grasp the situation.
That person was standing there, as if to shield me.
That person turned only their face to look at me.
With the same unchanging smile, that person looked at me.
And, a few seconds later--.
Shionaaaaaa!
With a completely blank mind, I scream.
Seeing that figure, my body began to move unconsciously.
With the mechanical arm hidden beneath my glove, I punched down one of the shelves. That caused a chain reaction, toppling shelves throughout the store--scattering fine fragments and even finer dust everywhere.
At the same time, I picked up a can that had fallen on the floor and threw it with all my might at the window.
The men reacted to the sound of the window glass shattering.
Did he escape through the window?
Chase him!
The men jumped out through the still-open door.
They're gone--
And as for me, I was crouching motionlessly right next to the fallen shelf, half of my body sunk into the floor that had been knocked out by the impact.
Hugging Shiona close to my chest so that the shelves and fragments wouldn't hit her.
Shiona, Shiona, stay with me!
I desperately shake Shiona, whose eyes are closed.
It seems she's lost consciousness.
I run my eyes over Shiona's body, but I can't find any wounds.
Could it be that the bullet didn't hit her? But, since she's unconscious, I can't say she's unharmed.
In any case, I have to evacuate immediately.
…Near here, a place where I can do that is…
I take a deep breath and remember.
The girl I left waiting at the library.
I took the back streets, careful to avoid being seen by the humans, and headed back to the library.
Carrying Shiona on my back was a considerable handicap, but I weaved through the ruined buildings again and again.
During that time, Shiona didn't move at all. That made it easier to carry her, but at the same time, my anxiety grew.
If something were to happen to Shiona--I was almost crushed by that fear, but I arrived at the library.
The clouds covering the sky had darkened even further.
Having finally reached the library, I began searching for Tippy.
Is Tippy alright?
For now, there were no signs of the library having been ransacked.
No signs of anyone having entered.
After passing through the entrance, the interior of the library was silent.
Feeling relieved, I weaved between the shelves, searching for Tippy.
But no matter how much I searched, I couldn't find Tippy.
Could it be--.
Trying to shake off the unpleasant thought, I desperately searched the area.
Could it be--.
Clinging to hope, I headed to the lobby.
I went around to the back.
There, I found Tippy, covering her ears and eyes, trembling slightly.
I reached out my hand to that small body.
Tippy, I'm back.
Tippy's shoulders twitched slightly.
But when she recognized me, she hugged me with the force of a leap.
"Welcome back. I believed in you, Rei."
She pressed large tears against my chest.
Her body was trembling slightly.
Ah, I had made this child anxious again.
I put my hand on her back and stroked it.
"It's okay... I'll never leave you again."
Perhaps relieved by those words, Tippy's trembling lessened and eventually stopped.
"What happened? What's wrong with Shiona?"
Tippy stared at Shiona, who still had her eyes closed, and asked anxiously.
I told her the truth without hiding anything.
"She was shot. To protect me... She doesn't seem to be injured, but she's unconscious..."
"Show me right away!"
With unprecedented agility, Tippy scooped up Shiona and laid her on the floor.
"Rei, turn around, I'm going to check Shiona's injuries."
"Ah, okay... Wait, is Shiona injured!?"
"I don't know. But I'm going to check."
Seeing Tippy's hand on Shiona's clothes, I hurriedly turned around.
Shortly after--
"...I'm okay, there were no problems...Rei."
Tippy's tone had returned to normal.
I quietly turned around.
Shiona was breathing peacefully on the lobby floor where she was laid down.
I thought she had been shot protecting me, but it seems she just lost consciousness from the close-range gunshot.
"I'm glad..."
I sighed with heartfelt relief.
"Rei, why was Shiona shot?"
"Humans came. And they're starting to loot in this town. Destroying buildings--"
I didn't mention that they were trying to 'dispose' of the townspeople, or that Mad-san might have already been 'taken care of'.
"And when I was found and about to be shot, Shiona protected me--"
I clenched my fist tightly without thinking. Tippy looked at me sadly,
"--I see. But if that's the case... this place might be dangerous too."
She replied with a solemn face.
"Can't we just hide and wait it out... until the humans leave somehow...?"
As if to stop my words, Tippy sadly shook her head.
"The humans have found this town. A town for them to live in. So, they'll come here too."
"No way... are they going to settle down here...?"
"Because this is a 'town'."
A town... That's right.
I walked across barren lands before I reached this place.
With no food or water, I was constantly facing death.
Those humans must have traveled through such a world too.
If that's the case, this "town" is a paradise they couldn't have wished for more.
"But... even so, why do they have to steal? The people of this town would have accepted them."
"It's for them to live."
"Just because it's for that, doesn't mean they can do anything... it's wrong to sacrifice someone else!"
"...Rei, scary..."
"Ah, sorry, I didn't mean to scare you, Tippy..."
I released the fist I had clenched in anger and stroked Tippy's head to reassure her.
Let's think about Tippy and Shiona for now.
If we stay in town like this, these two will be in danger too.
I really want to help everyone in town. But, I can't right now. I don't have the power or wisdom.
I'll freeze the emotions that Shiona and the townspeople taught me for now, and mechanically... make the most efficient choice.
Let's go somewhere we can settle down for a while.
"Tippy, let's leave town for now. And let's think about how to help the townspeople."
As I said that, my chest tightened.
It's because I put a rank on lives.
I chose the lives in front of me, within reach.
That must be a shameful thing. The weight of life is equal, yet... I'm still trying to choose...
"Yeah, I think that's a good idea."
The little girl's nod lightens my sense of guilt.
"Let's hide out in that abandoned factory for now. There shouldn't be anything there that the humans would want."
"Then, I have to prepare food for Rei and Shiona..."
"That's right. I wish we could somehow get to the church."
The library and the church where we are now are on opposite sides of the square, at opposite ends of town.
Even if we leave the town and make a big detour, we won't last long if we're targeted in a place with no cover. On top of that, I'll be carrying Shiona on my back.
So, does that mean we have to go through the rubble again? It'll be even more difficult this time since Tippy's with us...
I explained that to Tippy as clearly as possible.
"Is it hard to go to the church?"
"Yeah... for now, it is."
"Then, you should go under!"
"...Under?"
"Yeah, under. Go under the ground to the church."
"Yeah, underground. If it's underground, no one will find you."
"Underground... underground, huh... but how?"
"Go inside through the manhole, and then just go under the town."
...I see.
Certainly, if we did that, we could get to the church without being seen by anyone.
"That's a great idea, Tippy! You're amazing, Tippy!"
"Ehehe... Rei praised me."
"But, where are the manholes located in town?"
"Hmm... Rei, come here."
Tippy takes my hand and leads me to a bookshelf.
Without the slightest hesitation, she came to a certain bookshelf.
"That book."
I take the book Tippy is pointing at and open it.
Inside was a map of the town's manhole locations and its underground waterways.
"You're amazing, Tippy! With this, we can get to the church without any problems."
"Thank you... Rei."
I pat her head, and Tippy narrows her eyes in delight.
"Alright, Tippy. Let's get going right away."
"Okay... but wait. I'll get ready, so just a little bit--wait?"
"Yeah, sure."
"Thank you, Rei."
She bows quickly and disappears into the back room.
Tippy said she was okay, but I'm still worried that she hasn't regained consciousness.
Maybe the humans didn't shoot her with a gun that fires bullets, but with a weapon that robs you of your freedom.
If I know the cause, I can figure out how to deal with it.
Is this how terrifying an unknown situation can be?
"Rei, sorry to keep you waiting. --What's wrong?"
Tippy came back from the back room.
"No, it's nothing. I was just a little worried about Shiona."
I answered, trying to appear as calm as possible.
"So, what are you taking with you?"
Tippy, who said she was getting ready, was carrying a large bag.
"A stuffed animal and... a picture book and... crayons."
"I see. They're important to you, aren't they?"
"And... pictures of Papa and Mama."
Tippy said sadly.
Pictures of her parents, who will probably never return.
I don't know how Tippy feels as she stares at those photos.
"Um, then what's this?"
Apart from the large bag, Tippy was carrying a thin but sturdy metal bag. It seemed a little too rugged for little Tippy to carry.
"This is... I'll tell you about it later. More importantly, Rei, let's go."
"Ah, okay..."
With Tippy's help, I carry Shiona, who is lying on the floor, on my back. Strangely, I couldn't feel her weight.
"I'm ready, Tippy."
"Okay, then... goodbye."
Tippy said goodbye to the countless bookshelves.
Her voice sounded somewhat sad.
I still haven't been able to heal this girl's sadness at all.
But I haven't given up.
We'll be together from now on.
Even if it's just little by little, as we spend time together...
I want to heal Tippy's sadness.
And someday, I want to see Tippy with a genuine smile on her face.
That was my secret wish right now.
"Alright, let's go."
"--Okay."
Even so, Tippy followed me without uttering a single complaint.
By the time we reached the church, we were quite exhausted.
There were no signs of humans around.
We cautiously looked around and stepped into the church.
The chapel was silent.
It was a silence that made the town's commotion seem like a lie.
I found a music box on the altar at the back of the chapel.
Was this where Shiona listened to its melody?
The sound of my footsteps as I walked towards the music box echoed loudly in the chapel.
I approached the altar and reached for the music box.
As I turned the handle, a melody poured out from inside.
That melody warmed the depths of my heart somehow.
--Suddenly, I heard a singing voice.
It came from behind me.
"Welcome back,"
Shiona said, and got off my back.
"That's not important. Are you hurt anywhere? Tippy said you were okay, but..."
"Yeah, I seem to be fine."
Shiona smiled to reassure me. Then, she looked at Tippy, who was next to her.
"Tippy-chan... you came too, huh?"
"Yeah--"
Tippy nodded, looking as sad as ever--yet with a look of resolve on her face.
"Shiona..."
Tippy held her palm out towards Shiona, stopping her words.
"I understand... I understand, but!"
Shiona looked down, as if enduring something.
"--Shiona."
In response, Tippy was gentle as ever...
Those were such unexpected words. Shiona gasped and stared into Tippy's small eyes.
"While I was with Rei, I realized what Shiona is trying to do."
"But, if that's the case--"
"That's another reason why I came here. The library is impossible now... Probably this town too."
"Tippy-chan, I'm sorry..."
"It's okay. Shiona doesn't need to cry."
Kneeling down, Shiona jumped into Tippy's arms, and Tippy gently embraced her, saying that.
It was as if Tippy was the older sister, giving one that illusion.
"Rei, what are you going to do now?"
Tippy's words snapped me back to reality.
"If Shiona seems okay, I want to help the people of the town. Especially those who were said to be disposed of--"
"Disposed of?"
"Yeah..."
It was a terrible way of putting it... Speaking as if they didn't see other humans as humans.
"Can you do it, Rei?"
"I don't know, but... even so, I can't just stand by and watch someone get killed right in front of me."
"But, Rei, you'll be in danger."
"Yeah, I know that, but..."
They're the kind of guys who would point a gun at you without a second thought. There's nothing I can do by confronting them head-on.
I'm sure even having a discussion would be impossible.
"I promise. If it gets even a little dangerous, I'll definitely turn back."
"Absolutely. If Rei gets hurt--everything will be irreversible."
"Yeah. I can't just leave Shiona behind either."
"Rei..."
"Shiona--"
With that one word, we separated as if magnets repelled each other.
"S-Sorry! It's not like I forgot about Tippy-chan!"
"Only Shiona... that's not fair..."
Tippy pouted slightly, saying that.
"I'm sorry, Tippy. I didn't mean for it to happen..."
I apologized while gently stroking Tippy's head.
"Muu... That's not what I meant..."
Even so, Tippy's expression wasn't entirely displeased.
Shiona was the first to laugh at that, followed by me and then Tippy, all smiling.
And so, we laughed together.
Without a word, the three of us held hands.
As if never to be separated again, we gripped each other's hands tightly.
And before that resolve could waver, I declared.
"From now on, let's always be together, the three of us. Always--"
But, as if to mock me...
In the distance, the sound of footsteps echoed.
Shiona's smile, Tippy's smile, stiffened.
I'm sure I'm stiffening up too.
Everyone in town has been captured.
Then, the one heading towards this church now is--
Without a doubt, it's a human.
I was the first to move. I looked out the window, careful not to make a sound.
There's only one figure. However, I don't know how many more are coming behind.
Shiona, Tippy, head to the back of the chapel. Crouch down as much as possible, so you can't be seen from outside.
That's fine, but shouldn't we lock the door first?
No way. If we do that, they'll definitely call for backup. If that happens, we won't stand a chance.
I want to neutralize the human outside without making any noise if possible.
If it's just one person, I think I can manage. If there are two, we can somehow manage with a surprise attack.
But, if there are three or more... I haven't told Shiona or Tippy, but I was prepared to be captured alone.
I muffled my footsteps and stood in the shadow of the door. In the meantime, the footsteps are getting closer and closer.
The number is one. For now, there's no one following behind.
…Haaah…
I quietly took a deep breath and steeled myself.
I held my breath. The footsteps are--right nearby.
The door slowly opened.
Following that, a man holding a pistol slowly entered.
--Now!
In that instant, I swung my arm down with all my might from his blind spot.
Immediately, I kicked away the pistol that fell to the floor.
At the same time, I tried to sweep his legs, but he dodged it, as expected.
We're still close enough to be almost touching.
It's safe to assume he has weapons other than a gun.
If so, I can catch him off guard by pouncing on him the moment he reaches for one.
But the man quietly tilted his head and looked at me.
What do you think you're doing?
He asked in a monotone voice.
Why are you hostile to us? Are you the owner of this town?
Owner? I just want to do what's best for the people of this town.
That's just like something a Phloid would say.
...So what if it is...? That's my reason for existing.
As I said that, I removed the glove from my right hand, showing off my mechanical hand.
It's not a good idea to fight me head-on with my mechanical body.
If I can make him think that, maybe he'll back off.
Right now, I just need to ensure Shiona and Tippy's safety. Even if my true identity is exposed to them, I'll protect what I want to protect.
That's my role as a Phloid.
The man tilted his head again at my actions.
What are you talking about? Phloids can't take any combat actions. They're made to obey orders, so they can't go against humans.
"Huh?"
"In any case, you're an incompatible element trapped in old-fashioned thinking. I'll eliminate you before you become a source of trouble."
The blade is thrust straight towards my throat.
I grab the knife's blade with my mechanical right hand. Then, I put all my strength into it and twist it sharply.
With just that, the knife blade snapped clean off at the base.
I put my entire body weight into pushing him down. I press my left elbow against his throat and pin his legs with my knees--
"Rei!"
Shiona burst out from the back of the room.
I pressed down on the man's throat with my left hand and said, raising my bare metal right hand.
This is a metal arm that can break knives. If I swing it down on his head with all my might, he won't come out of it unscathed.
"Rei, stop!"
Shiona pleaded in a trembling voice.
--But.
Gritting my teeth, I put all my strength into--swinging my right hand down.
My right hand was half-buried.
Not in the man's head, but in the floor right next to it.
"Why spare me? Considering your own safety, killing me is the correct choice."
The man said, remaining expressionless as ever.
"That's not true. Killing someone is the wrong choice, no matter the reason."
"Incorrigible. Such an inefficient way of thinking."
"I'll take you hostage. And make them release the townspeople."
I grab the man by the collar and pull him up.
"That's pointless. My life has no such value. If my death now opens the way for my comrades' future, there's no reason to regret it."
Without changing his tone in the slightest, the man took something out of his pocket.
It was an old-fashioned bomb. He pulled out the safety pin and grabbed my arm at the same time.
"What!"
I instantly pull my arm back, but it doesn't budge.
I shudder.
Why doesn't this human show any emotion on his face, even at this moment when he's about to throw his life away?
I felt like I was being bound by the color of his eyes, which seemed devoid of any will.
--No good! If I let my thoughts stop, it's over!
I instantly switch gears and start analyzing the situation.
What the man is holding is a really small bomb, about the size of a small fruit.
But, since it's a bomb, it will have lethal force, and more importantly, the blast could alert the humans staying in the town.
When? When will it explode?
The other guy intends to blow himself up. It's certain that there isn't much time.
But, what should I do? If the scale of the explosion is large, Shiona and the others hiding will also be affected.
It's impossible to neutralize this bomb, so what's the best way to minimize its effect?
I reflexively hug the man. In a way that sandwiches the bomb.
This way, I might at least be able to protect Shiona and the others from the blast. It might be imperfect, but it's the best choice I can think of.
If only I can save at least these two──
The next moment, the impact came.
From the side. Like being shoved away... no, I was shoved!
While rolling on the floor, I look at the place I was just in.
There, holding the bomb, was Shiona.
"Shiona!"
"Get down!"
The bomb she was clutching burst with a strong light and sound.
Perhaps the scale of the explosion wasn't that large because it was a type of bomb not intended for killing.
Even so, I, who was at point-blank range, was hit directly by the blast and sound, and felt dizzy.
The human who was also at point-blank range has also lost consciousness.
"Shiona!"
In my swaying vision, I shouted.
Please, please be safe.
"Shiona!?"
"...Rei..."
"Shio...na..."
"Shiona, we need to treat you immediately!"
The distance of a few steps felt incredibly long.
Slapping my faltering legs, I approach Shiona.
There, I saw it.
What... is this...
Seeing Shiona's figure, I was speechless.
Her right arm was thrown onto the floor... from the wrist onward... a metallic... frame?
Not bone. Absolutely not. It's clearly different from a human's.
And... it's gone.
That's strange.
Something that should be there, isn't.
Red.
That is the proof of a human.
Wh-wh-why...
B-but...
I clench my mechanical right hand, covered by a glove.
Yes, if we were the same... if only we were the same...
Shiona, are you... alright?
Yeah, I'm fine with this much.
There's no way that's true.
There's no way that could be true.
She took the explosion at such close range.
There's no way she could be alright.
It must be so painful that she can't help but shed tears from the intense pain.
And yet.
And yet, why?
"Rather than me... Rei, your head."
I followed Shiona's gaze and touched my head.
--Ah, I wonder why.
Why is it that something Shiona needs is with me?
I don't need this.
I don't need this, so I wish Shiona had it.
No, she should have had it.
Shiona touches my head and says.
"You're bleeding, are you okay?"
Blood was flowing from my head.
Red.
Red blood.
Something that doesn't flow in a Philoid...
In contrast, not even a drop of blood flowed from Shiona's arm.
Instead, exposed mechanical parts are visible.
What this means is only one thing.
That is--
"...Rei? There was a loud noise, are you okay--Shiona!? Rei!?"
Tipi, who came out from the back, screamed.
Her expression was anxious, and her eyes were filled with tears.
"You both need to heal your injuries...!".
"It's okay... I'm okay, so...".
I gently embraced Tipi, who was on the verge of panicking, as if to envelop her.
Embraced, Tipi's face showed a slight expression of relief in my chest.
But it was unstable.
It looked like it was about to collapse at any moment, and it made my chest ache.
"Rei... let's move, we can't stay here anymore..."
Tipi said in a trembling voice. Shiona also nodded in agreement.
Certainly, with that explosion just now, other humans will definitely come.
There were many things I wanted to ask.
There were many things I wanted to confirm.
But, I swallow it all for now.
"...Let's go, let's leave town."
We left the church with only the bare minimum of luggage.
Then, following Tipi's instructions, we used the back streets of the town to escape to the outside, and headed for the abandoned factory.
Even there, I was made to realize...
That the fatigue made my steps heavy... was only me.
Led by Tipi and with Shiona pulling my hand, we continued walking.
Reaching the abandoned factory, I finally lowered myself to the ground.
Next to Shiona, who had a cool face, I tried to catch my ragged breath.
"Tipi, going to get water."
The little girl glanced at Shiona and then disappeared into the depths of the abandoned factory.
She probably entrusted all the explanations to Shiona.
"...Shiona."
Shiona returned a slightly troubled smile to my voice.
"I think you've already noticed, but I am... no. Everyone living in this town is a Filoid."
That was... what I was trying to avoid facing.
I had a premonition... I felt something was off... but it was something I didn't want to admit...
"So... I'm a 'human'?"
When my head was damaged, a red liquid leaked from the damaged area.
It closely resembled the 'blood' that flows inside a human body.
Filoids don't have such a liquid, so it shouldn't flow.
"You've been misunderstanding because of the mechanical arm... that's an artificial medical part to replace limbs lost in an accident or something."
"That means... I really am..."
"Yes, you are a human. Our creators and partners, the Filoids. That's who you are. Everyone in town is a Filoid. Only you were human."
"I see..."
I stared at my mechanical right hand covered in a glove and weakly clenched it.
The existence I thought I had was the complete opposite... .
Shiona is a Filoid... and I'm a human... .
In other words, I, myself, am a human, the very existence I should hate.
I felt something deep inside my chest.
That feeling was painful.
Sad.
And infuriating.
I was the same as those cold-blooded, merciless beings I could only see as evil.
My chest ached unbearably.
I felt anger at this unchangeable truth.
What the man I was dealing with earlier said was right.
I wasn't a Filoid, but a human.
And those humans, the rulers, are trying to do terrible things to the townspeople, the Filoids, who are the ruled--no, they probably already are.
How did things end up like this?
I just wanted to live together with Shiona and the townspeople.
I just wanted to make everyone happy.
But, but, but--.
I can't do that.
Because I'm a human.
Because I'm one of those hopeless creatures.
I felt warmth in my fist, which I had unconsciously clenched.
When I lowered my gaze, I saw Shiona's hand placed over mine.
That temperature is artificial.
But, it didn't matter to me.
...It's warm.
Just that alone made the emotions weighing on my heart fade away.
But at the same time, it highlighted my own inadequacy.
Do I even deserve her kindness?
"Do you want to know more? About you guys?"
Shiona said to me with a smile.
"By 'you guys,' do you mean humans?"
"Yes, humans. Do you want to know about our partners?"
If I can learn about it, I want to know.
So I nodded.
"I want to know... I want to know why we ended up like this."
"Ray, do you remember the picture of Tippy-chan in the library?"
"Ah, I remember..."
"That picture, Tippy-chan draws it every day. Every single day, no matter what, one picture a day."
I closed my eyelids and recalled that scene.
There were dozens, hundreds of those pictures drawn with crayons.
"How many do you think there are?"
"I don't know... If Tippy is also a Philoid, she's probably been drawing for years... Maybe there are about a thousand."
"Eighty-six thousand six hundred and seventy-one."
"Eighty-six thou--"
Once again, a strong dizziness attacked me. But it wasn't from the earlier explosion or the subsequent bleeding.
For so long, Tippy had been all alone in that dark library?
Hardly anyone ever came to that library.
It must have been a lonely existence.
Just thinking about the time Tippy spent there, I felt a terror as if I were losing my footing.
And Tippy endured it.
With that small body.
"From there, decades before that, we Philoids were born. Desired by humans--"
Shiona told me the history of the Philoids as if singing a song.
First, Philoids were androids that had reached the practical stage, equipped with human emotions.
Basic emotional information was installed from the beginning, and a system was adopted that allowed them to learn new emotions through self-sufficient thinking circuits.
Including that, it can be said that they are as close to humans as possible.
Therefore, they were able to become as close to humans as possible, not only in work but also in life.
Eventually, companies appeared that installed custom-made emotions and memories, and an unprecedented Philoid boom arrived.
Families who could not have children purchased child Philoids, and those who had lost parents or children ordered Philoids with their memories, ushering in such an era.
In the blink of an eye, the number of Philoids increased, and in just over a decade, the number produced was comparable to the human population.
Among them, the most revolutionary was the Philoid equipped with 'love,' the most complex of human emotions.
It had the ability to serve as a companion for life.
It became possible to obtain a loved one without going through the process of romance, and that love was guaranteed semi-permanently.
In a society where late marriage was progressing and more humans were prioritizing work over romance, the demand was great and it was received with applause.
However, children were not born into families who married Philoids, which accelerated the declining birthrate.
And the declining birthrate created a shortage of marriage partners, creating a loop in which more and more people married Philoids.
And then, before they knew it, humans forgot how to nurture love.
Shiona smiled sadly.
Human children began to be created artificially using science. But humans who had lost love could not teach love to the children who were born.
Love was the origin of all emotions.
Because there is love, you feel the joy of connecting with someone.
Because there is love, you know what you want to protect and feel anger when it is hurt.
Because there is love, you feel sadness when you lose something important.
Because there is love... you share, divide, and know the joy of sharing the same emotions.
But... they forgot it.
The humans who came to town are probably those kinds of "humans."
Humans who have forgotten "emotion" along with love have even lost the ability to care for others.
Humans no longer needed love, and the existence of Philoids with emotions became unpleasant to them.
When they thought about streamlining their actions, they felt it was too wasteful...
Humans eventually came to believe that Philoids should be machines.
To deliberately place them in harsh environments... to have them perform dangerous tasks... to abuse them beyond their specifications...
But there were humans who wouldn't allow it.
Humans who retained the emotion of love appealed, saying that Philoids were partners.
The world was divided in two.
Humans with love, and humans without.
And the humans without love concluded:
That the ideas of the old generation were foolish, that they should be annihilated...
They didn't even hesitate to press the button for a weapon that would scorch the earth.
After that, everything happened quickly.
It didn't even take five days for retaliation to call for retaliation, and for the world to be enveloped in flames and ash.
A polluted, toxic earth, black clouds blocking the sunlight, a sea that could not sustain life.
Human history would come to an end by its own hand...
It was such a foolish choice.
"We, who were born for the sake of humans, ended up stealing the most important thing from them."
"That's not true... we humans are to blame for everything..."
"But you know, there were many humans who survived. No matter how tattered the world becomes, life never stops moving forward."
I can't find the words to respond to Shiona, who speaks to me so gently.
"...Ahem, ah, aah, aah."
Suddenly, Shiona started vocalizing.
And then, she turned to face my puzzled self head-on──
"Nice to meet you. I am Alice mk-17, MODA-117 manufactured by Asou International. Have you completed your user registration? If you have, please decide on my individual name. It's the first name I'll be given. Please choose carefully!"
I was caught off guard.
It's easy enough to say I'd never seen this before... but it was the first time I'd seen Shiona so utterly cheerful and innocent.
"Surprised?"
Shiona asked, back to her usual self.
"Y-yeah..."
"That was the oldest memory I have."
I wonder when that was. I can't even imagine.
"Back then, every day was like a festival... it was so lively."
So saying, Shiona showed me a piece of paper that looked like a newspaper clipping.
"World-renowned Musician Passes Away"
The photo in it was the same one that was in the photo frame in Shiona's room.
He had a face similar to mine.
"Is this... your older brother?"
"Yes, this story is also from a long time ago... You know, I'm the latest model of Philoid that was manufactured. Fifth generation, I think."
I wonder how Shiona feels about describing herself as 'manufactured'.
Philoids have emotions just like humans.
In other words, they're the same as humans.
Can she really be so detached about it?
"My generation was the first model to be equipped with the concept of human 'death'. It was to get as close to humans as possible. But the models before me aren't equipped with it... That's Mad-san and Tippy-chan. Neither of them can understand 'death'. It's useless to explain it. The day they understand it will never come."
To continue waiting, without knowing death.
It's a hope that exists, but a hope that will never be rewarded.
Despair in the guise of hope.
To be confronted with that unconditionally.
If I'm going to be confronted with something like that, wouldn't it be better to just teach me despair from the start?
I thought it would be better that way.
"Tippy-chan is an even earlier model... I think she was a second-generation Philoid. Up to the second generation, they couldn't extract energy from food. That's why she runs on electricity. But there's a limit to how long the battery lasts. She carries that bear plushie as an auxiliary battery for that."
Come to think of it, Tippy always had that plushie in her hands whenever she moved somewhere.
I had no idea it was a battery.
But that explains some things.
Like why Tippy was always in that library.
That library has the only power generation system in town.
Tippy was staying in that place to continue functioning.
"Tippy-chan's parents also died a long time ago. Probably more than 200 years ago. But Tippy-chan, who has no concept of death, is waiting. Always, always, all alone."
What a cruel story.
I don't know the lifespan of a Philoid, but Tippy has spent hundreds of years like that.
Every day, shedding tears.
Trapped by a future that will never come—...held captive by an impossible hope.
All alone in that library.
It feels like there's a lead ball in the depths of my chest.
It's painful and agonizing.
But the more I think about it, the deeper it sinks into my core.
"But, even knowing that, it's still painful."
And Shiona is aware of death. In other words, she can't even hold onto the hope that we might meet again.
"Rei, you saw Mad collapse at the general store, right?"
"Yeah... it was strange. It was like only his soul had been extracted, even though he had no external injuries—"
I understand now. Mad was already broken at that time.
"But, we have to keep living like this. Until the day we die—the day we break. For us who don't get sick, that's a time equal to eternity. That's why we try to be human. Wouldn't it be too sad otherwise? We take over the work that our partners were doing, or we take over the work of positions that have disappeared... We keep the world turning, just like humans used to. So that this world that humans used to run never stops."
Mad ran the general store.
There were various shops in town, like a photo shop and a bar.
All of that was the work of the Philoids.
It was the effort of the Philoids to protect the human world.
It was the last hope of the Philoids who had been left behind.
"So that when humans return someday, we can tell them about the world from those fun times, so that we can give it back to them, we spend every day like this."
Shiona showed a smile.
An emotion that definitely doesn't fit the current situation.
With that smile, Shiona was protecting herself.
That smile looked sad to me.
"...But, we Philoids also have flaws. That is, if something unbearably painful happens, only some kind of emotion comes to the forefront. I'm like this, Mad is always angry, and Tippy-chan is always sad."
But, Shiona continued.
"It's our last fortress. If even that emotion disappears, we'll break... we'll die."
"Then, when Shiona was shot, Mad was—"
"That's right. He didn't just go on a trip. After Rei finished showing him that movie, Mad stopped mov—no, he stopped moving."
"Then, closing the store was—Shiona?"
"Yeah. I thought that if I didn't, Rei would start to wonder, even if the townspeople didn't. And I was right, wasn't I?"
"Well, yeah, but..."
If the store had stayed open there, I definitely would have gone inside and found Mad, unmoving.
If the humans hadn't come, I probably never would have noticed.
In the end, it was confirmed that I wasn't just seeing things.
I didn't want to believe it, but it was the truth.
"My brother used to say, 'Emotions are pieces of the puzzle of life.' The pieces called emotions are what connect life. If emotions are missing, all the pieces will crumble. That's the same for both humans and Philoids. Mad broke because the emotion of anger towards his son dissipated."
If that's the case, then I'm the one who killed Mad.
I went and found the playback device on my own, and I showed Mad his son's movie on my own.
If I hadn't done that, Mad wouldn't have broken and would still be moving now.
As if sensing my feelings, Shiona moved to my left side and placed her hand on mine.
"It's okay, it's not Rei's fault. Sooner or later, we're all destined to end up like that. It's the same as humans not being able to escape death. Mad was surely happy. He was able to know his son's true feelings in the end."
"Maybe so. But—"
An unbearable feeling swells up.
If I had known that back then—I would have stopped him, even by force.
"You're so kind, Rei—"
"That's not true..."
Shiona stood next to me.
I couldn't see Shiona's expression.
Anxiety pounded against my chest from the inside.
"Because even knowing, I still wish for it. I wonder if I'll ever see that smile again."
Shiona smiled sadly as she looked down at her brother's photo.
"That's why, when I first met Rei, I was so happy. Ah, so it was a dream after all, I thought. My brother was alive."
The matter of dying.
Whether you know it or not, it was painful either way.
Created to be convenient for humans, forced to have a family, and then left with only the pain of death.
Selfish and awful.
That's what we, humans, were.
"Tipi is feeling the loneliness of losing her family. That's why, if we act like family, she'll 'die.' But that doesn't mean I don't want you to say those things to Rei. We Philoids have a rule that we can't do or say anything that 'makes us realize we're Philoids.' Because it would shatter the humans' dreams. But, I went too far... I'm sorry."
As Shiona lowered her head, a sweet scent wafted around.
Certainly, what Shiona did wasn't something that could be forgiven.
But, considering Shiona's feelings, it was clear that that method was the most reasonable.
"It can't be helped. Shiona was just following the rules, it's not your fault."
Forgiving someone like this, and someone being forgiven.
Apologizing, and being apologized to.
Crying, getting angry, and laughing.
That's what humans are.
They, the Philoids, knew that better than anyone.
"Thank you for telling me, Shiona. For being so kind to me, a human..."
I felt ashamed as a human.
To think that I was repaying the kindness of these Philoids who were doing so much for me with evil.
Even as we speak, humans in the town might be 'disposing' of Philoids.
And the Philoids probably can't offer much resistance to it.
Thinking that, I couldn't hide the pain deep in my chest.
Shiona gently reached out and embraced me.
A warm warmth enveloped me.
"Of course. Humans and Philoids are partners, both in the past and now. It's decided that it will be that way far into the future, too."
I felt like the emotion I couldn't understand until the very end was there.
It was warm, vast, deep, strong, gentle, soft, large, and precious.
Humans had lost something significant.
But, they remembered what the humans had forgotten.
For many years, many decades, many centuries.
Even while enduring loneliness, they continued to protect it.
I felt like I had to inherit that and protect it in the same way.
It wasn't a duty or an order.
It was something I myself desired.
"I'm back, I found some pretty water," she said.
As I was sharing body heat with Shiona, Tippy called out to us from behind.
For some reason, I felt embarrassed and instinctively distanced myself from Shiona.
The warmth that had been touching my skin was snatched away by the air.
But, that gap was immediately filled with a new warmth.
I looked and saw Tippy had slipped in between Shiona and me.
"Tippy too... hug," she said.
Shiona and I exchanged glances.
Shiona seemed to be entrusting the decision to me.
Tippy has lived in solitude for two hundred years.
If things continue as they are, Tippy will be able to live semi-permanently without breaking.
But, is that happiness?
Does an empty life have any value?
I embraced Shiona.
Including Tippy, who was standing between us.
Shiona, in turn, embraced me as well.
Tippy hugged both of us close, and muttered softly.
"Warm..."
It was warmth after two hundred years.
Tippy had been waiting for something so trivial for two whole centuries.
That was a very sad time...
If I could give her two hundred years' worth of warmth, I would definitely give it to Tippy.
Because if I did, I feel like I could say that the time Tippy waited wasn't wasted.
"What are we going to do now, Rei?"
Shiona asked me, still holding Tippy from behind.
"If I could... I still want to help everyone in town... but I don't think I can right now."
I feel bad for the people in town, but I don't have the power to do so.
First, I want to ensure the safety of Shiona and Tippy.
"It's a little far, but let's go to the factory where I woke up."
No, that place probably wasn't a factory.
A facility where people who could no longer live in the world due to war continued to sleep until the polluted land was somewhat better.
My... awakening was a little late.
"There was still electricity there. Shiona and I can ingest food, so we'll be fine if we have the food we brought from town. But in Tippy's case, she needs to be charged."
"Shiona..."
She must have realized it just from those words. Tippy spoke up.
"Yeah, that's right... I'm sorry."
"No. I thought I had to say it soon."
Somewhat sadly, yet with a slightly stiff expression, Tippy continued.
"Tippy too, has to do what Tippy can do... while I still can."
"...Tippy-chan?"
Something must have caught her, Shiona questioned Tippy.
"The three of us, we'll survive."
It was a baseless statement.
There was no guarantee, nothing.
Even so, I could only continue those words.
"We will, always, always survive together, the three of us."
It was just an ideal.
I know the world isn't sweet enough to live on ideals alone.
Of course, Shiona probably does too.
Even so, Shiona doesn't express any doubts to me.
Anxiety or dissatisfaction.
She sealed all those words away.
Surely her heart must be filled with them.
In fact, my heart was being trampled by those feelings.
Even so, it's necessary.
Words of hope.
"...Yeah."
Shiona nodded and hugged me and Tippy even tighter.
And so, we began our journey towards the facility.
"This is... outside the town..."
Facing the wilderness, Tippy clutches her bear plush to her chest.
"Is this different from the scenery Tippy knows?"
"Yeah. When I saw it before, there was a road, and a forest, and then—and then—"
The scenery Tippy described was like a larger-scale version of the festival-like days Shiona had told me about.
It seems that in those days, humans freely controlled not only towns, but also nature, the Phylloids, and even the weather.
"So... by the time I started operating, humans were already beginning to decline..."
Shiona seems a little lonely. The hem of her clothes is blown wildly by the dust-filled wind.
"Alright, let's go!"
With a little food and a spare battery for Tippy, we started walking through the wilderness to survive.
And more than anything, to survive.
Struggling, struggling, to survive.
Floundering, floundering, to stay alive.
Just being alive is enough.
Just being alive had value.
I truly thought so from the bottom of my heart.
Using the position of the sun, faintly discernible through the dim clouds, as a guide, I walk while searching my memory.
As the sun sets and the temperature drops, the three of us huddle together and fall asleep.
Sometimes singing songs, sometimes encouraging each other, sometimes joking around...
We continue on a journey that is not always just painful.
We crossed the reddish-brown earth and reached our destination three full days later, just as the sun was beginning to set.
"The building is half-buried in sand... No wonder we couldn't find it. I can't believe this kind of facility was still around..."
As we entered, faint lights flickered on, and the air conditioning hummed to life somewhere.
The room was exactly as it had been when I woke up. For now, I gathered up all the Phylloid parts that would be unpleasant for Shiona and Tippy.
I'm sure these Phylloids were protecting us humans while we were in cold sleep.
"Yay, I can sit down!"
Tippy ran ahead and was the first to sit on the sofa that was there.
As soon as she sat down, the strength seemed to drain from her body.
It seems I was pushing her pretty hard.
"...It's kind of cold here."
"It was originally a facility for cold sleep, after all."
Even though we're indoors, it's a little colder than outside.
Now that the air conditioning is working, I'd like to think there's still a function to raise the temperature inside the facility.
But I don't know where it is.
"I wish we had some kind of heater..."
"I know what to do. Rei, sit next to Tippy."
"Like this?"
"Closer!"
"L-Like this?"
When I asked, almost pressed against Tippy, Shiona looked satisfied and said,
"Yeah, that should do it!"
And then she sat on the opposite side of me and Tippy, where we were pressed together.
--Pressed together tightly, just like me and Tippy.
"See? Isn't that warmer?"
"Y-Yeah... I guess so."
It's certainly warm. Warm, but...
"How is it, Tippy? Still cold?"
"Mmm... warm."
Tippy narrowed her eyes and snuggled against my arm.
"Warm? Good, I'm glad."
"Yeah, warm... so, so warm, Rei. It's like..."
"Like what?"
"When we're like this, it's like we're a family."
"............"
"Tippy's Papa and Mama used to hug Tippy like this a lot."
"Yeah. It's like that time, it's warm."
"...Yeah, it's warm, isn't it."
"...Hey, can you hug me again? Can you squeeze Tippy tight?"
I almost hugged her without thinking, but I stopped when I felt Shiona's sad gaze.
"Tippy, I can't do that."
"Why? Won't you squeeze me tight?"
"Yes, that's right. Because Tippy, we're not family or anything."
"Not family... is Tippy all alone?"
"Yes. No matter how long we're together, you're alone. That's something that can't be changed."
If you only picked up the words, they were cold, as if she hated Tippy.
But now I understand.
That those words are filled with kindness.
The only emotion remaining within Tippy.
--Sadness.
To fill Tippy's heart would mean to release her from sadness...
In other words, it's the same as dying.
Until now, I had been hugging Tippy without thinking.
But perhaps that was a kindness that was far too cruel.
No, perhaps it wasn't even kindness at all.
It was nothing more than a self-satisfying act that only shortened Tippy's lifespan.
Shiona had been enduring it all this time.
To protect Tippy's feeling of sadness... more than anything, to protect Tippy.
She must have really wanted to hug her.
She must have wanted to pat her head and say kind words to her.
She must have wanted to give her a smile that turned her heart orange.
Without reaching out to this blue girl, she had been enduring it all this time.
That's why I thought I had to endure it, too.
I thought so, but… I couldn't stop myself.
I just couldn't bring myself to leave this girl with such a sad expression in front of me.
I embraced Tipi, and Shiona beyond her, in my arms.
The back of my eyes grew hot.
I knew this was shortening Tipi's lifespan, but I questioned myself why I couldn't stop.
Wasn't I just temporarily satisfying my own desires...?
I really am human after all...
Selfish, full of self-interest, a human who hurts others.
I hugged them both tightly, painfully so.
I drew in the warmth of two people.
As if to fill the void of two hundred years, we brought our warmth closer.
The warmth of three people didn't allow us to feel the cold, even within the freezing facility.
It was that warm.
From Shiona's mouth, a melody naturally spilled out.
That song that Onii-san made.
That melody lights a warmth deep within my heart.
Her gentle singing voice echoed throughout the factory.
"Tipi loves Shiona's singing of this song,"
Tipi said, burying her face in my chest.
"It reminds me of when Papa and Mama were here... and somehow, I can't stop crying."
The girl repeats her sadness.
Tipi has been repeating that sadness for two hundred years.
I may not be able to wipe away those two hundred years of sadness.
But I can give her this moment of warmth.
I decided to put those two hundred years' worth into this fleeting warmth and embrace them both.
But that small moment didn't last long.
"Huh... Tipi?"
I turn my gaze to Tipi, who is sitting on the sofa.
There, Tipi was blankly staring ahead.
"What's wrong? Are you feeling sick or something?"
"Hmm? ...Hmm..."
She doesn't seem very energetic.
Is it because she's been released from the tension, or because she walked for so long?
Either way, it seems like she needs to rest.
"Tipi seems tired too, so should we rest for tonight?"
"...Y-yeah."
She replies a beat late. It seems she was thinking about something.
"Rei, Tipi-chan might be lacking energy. That might be why her attention is scattered."
"I see... then we need to replenish her electricity. --Huh, how do we do that?"
"It's non-contact charging. The charging equipment should be universal, so first we need to find a connector and charge the bear plushie."
"Understood. I'll ask you to confirm if I find something that looks like it."
"Leave it to me!"
Leaving Tipi on the sofa, I begin to check what's inside the facility.
Many cold sleep devices are lined up. I look for one that's still leaking cold air.
Then, I opened the maintenance cover at its base and examined several cables connected to the distribution panel.
Before long, I discovered something that looked like a power connector connected to a thick cable.
"Yeah, this type should be fine. Tipi-chan, lend me your plushie."
Shiona borrows the bear plushie from Tipi, opens the zipper on its back, and exposes the connection terminal.
She inserts the charging connector there, and the bear's eyes blink twice.
That must be the signal that charging has started; Shiona breathes a sigh of relief.
Tipi also grips the bear's hand tightly. Just that seems to transmit electricity; I feel like the light in her eyes has intensified.
"Shiona, let's have a meal too."
I show her the oral blocks I found when I was looking for the charging cable.
It's the same thing we found when we left this facility.
"The taste is nothing compared to Shiona's soup, but I think it's nutritious."
"No, I'm happy because I was hungry. Just being able to eat makes my heart feel warm."
I line up the portable plates and arrange the oral blocks on top.
I thought this would make it look a little more like a meal.
Because it's a time like this, I want to cherish the everyday things, even the small ones.
I wanted to emulate, even just a little, what we used to do in that town... at Shiona's house.
"It looks delicious."
Shiona smiled, as if understanding my wish.
The two of us put our hands together before the meal.
Tipi, who was watching us, comes to our side.
Then, she places the bear plushie in front of us and puts her hands together just like we did.
"Together with everyone."
"Tipi-chan...?"
"Haha, Tipi is a very lavish feast. Very luxurious."
Tipi shyly gave a bashful smile.
In these past few days filled with nothing but hardship, it was a moment of peace.
Surely, in the distant past, we humans lived such a life with our partners called Phylloids.
No, it should be a life we can still reclaim now.
Just like I, who had lost my emotions, was taught by them... we should be able to reclaim the time we had forgotten...
I thought about such things as I brought the oral block remaining on the plate to my mouth.
──It was then.
『Warning. The wear rate of the main battery exceeds 90%. Please replace and maintain the battery immediately.』
Suddenly, Tipi started saying such things in a businesslike tone.
『Online replacement request will be made to the service center――The service center is offline. Retrying.――The service center is offline. Retrying.――The service center is offline. Retrying...』
"Shiona, what is this――!"
"I don't know the details, but it seems Tipi-chan's battery can't be charged anymore."
"Can't be charged..."
Was the voltage different? No, that shouldn't be a problem since it's going through the bear plushie.
In that case, is there a problem with the battery itself?
If there's a possibility... could it be deterioration over time? Come to think of it, it's a battery that's been running for over 200 years.
It wouldn't be strange if it was completely worn out.
"Maybe we need a new battery..."
"A brand new battery... Besides, Tipi-chan's generation couldn't be replaced without a specialized technician disassembling it first... !"
"No way..."
A cold sweat ran down my back.
In other words, Tipi will stop functioning as is... no, will she die?
"No, after coming all this way... !"
"It's okay... because I knew this would happen."
Tipi's voice, back to her usual tone, left us staring as if struck by lightning.
"Tipi-chan, you knew this was going to happen, didn't you--"
"Yes... I thought this would happen since we left the library. I also noticed the battery charging rate dropping 6427 days ago."
Tipi answered with a weak smile.
"More importantly, Tipi has to do what Tipi can do... Rei, could you bring me the metal briefcase Tipi had?"
"O-Okay!"
The slim, yet somewhat rugged metal briefcase that Tipi had been carrying ever since she left the library. Carrying the unexpectedly heavy case, I brought it in front of Tipi.
Tipi casually places one hand in the middle of the briefcase. With just that, the two locks on the handle side automatically unlocked.
Inside was a single black board. Its size was about that of a slightly larger book. However, it was much thinner, only about half the size of a short picture book.
Tipi carefully took it out with both hands, then slowly turned to face me.
"Rei. Place your palm here. The one that's not mechanical."
"Like this?"
As Tipi instructed, I placed my non-prosthetic hand on the jet-black board. Then...
A fluent male voice echoed from the black board.
"Current administrator, Vortex Company MSK-3737 model name 'Dorothy,' individual name 'Tipi,' has approved the continuation of work. Continuing registration process."
"Confirmed. Registration applicant, please state the name to identify the individual."
"Um... Rei."
"Understood. 《Rei》 has been registered as the new administrator. Please receive a verbal explanation of usage from the current administrator. That is all."
Having said that much, the black board fell silent.
"Tipi, what was that just now..."
"All the books that were in the library, digitized. It's a backup of Tipi's memory storage."
Tipi answered in a slightly tired—yet somehow accomplished—tone.
I recall the many handwritten books lined up in the library.
Tipi, who memorized the words written there without missing a single one.
So, Tipi was the one who wrote those books after all.
Even if she were to stop functioning someday... no, predicting that she would stop functioning, she made it so the records of the prehistoric civilization could be left as books.
That place wasn't just a library. Tipi herself was the library.
"When you use it, place your hand in the middle of the board just like before. That will make the tablet—the board—light up. After that, you'll be able to call up all the data with the administrator's voice recognition function..."
"Then—"
As Tipi instructed, I activated the board called a tablet. Just as I was told, I placed my palm on it.
『Biometrics confirmed, administrator Rei authenticated. Which data would you like to load?』
"The manual! How to repair a Philoid... uh, how to replace the battery!"
『Initiating search... There are 3,195 items and 124,751 types of information regarding Philoid repair methods. Narrowing down the search is recommended.』
"From those, Vortex Company MSK-3737 model 'Dorothy.'"
『Initiating search... Conditions matched.』
The surface of the tablet shone brightly. And letters floated to the surface.
『Repair by the user is almost impossible. Please allow it to rest until personnel from the service center arrive.』
My vision went dark.
"How is it? Is it working well?"
"Yeah, it's working... but..."
"That tablet... only has about... fifty years left... of use..."
That's more than enough time for me, but it probably isn't very long for a Philoid or the library's management system.
"Is it really okay for me to use it?"
"Rather, please use it. From now on... Tipi won't be useful anymore..."
"That's not true! Tipi has always been helping me!"
When I fixed Siona's music box, when I fixed Mad's projector. All of that was possible because Tipi firmly remembered the library's collection and taught me.
"It makes me happy to hear you say that, Rei—please use this from now on..."
Tipi, who had been sitting on the sofa, slowly lay down.
"Tipi!"
"Tipi-chan!"
We waited two hundred years.
We can't let it end here.
Tipi's small mouth moved up and down, opening and closing.
It looks like she's saying something, but her voice is so small I can't hear it.
I brought my ear close to her mouth.
"Hey, Rei... Tipi had fun."
Tipi's hand was placed on top of mine.
It's a small, soft hand.
"Rei as my father, Siona as my mother... Both of you are kind, and a family I love very much."
No matter how coldly I treated her, how much I pushed her away, I couldn't hide my true feelings.
Tipi had noticed.
How much we treasured Tipi.
From the moment we got involved, it was decided that Tipi would end up like this.
That there was nothing we could do about it.
That being alone forever was the only way for Tipi to survive.
But that's impossible, isn't it?
Tipi has emotions.
We're not perfect enough to overlook sadness.
No, that's not what you'd call perfect.
Because we can feel sadness, we're allowed to have emotions.
Slowly.
Like a handkerchief sinking into the water's surface, Tipi's eyes are closing.
Even though she's a Philoid we created, we can't even save her.
We just create them and then can't do anything else.
Humans are truly selfish creatures.
"Hey, Siona..."
Tipi's eyelids slowly opened again. But the light has already gone out of her eyes. She probably can't see anymore.
"I'm here... I'm here, Tipi-chan..."
Siona's voice was trembling slightly.
"I'm glad... Hey, Siona."
"Yes...?"
"Thank you for everything. You worked hard to keep Tipi from breaking, didn't you?"
"I think you realize, Tipi has been running for over two hundred years since she started operating... but her lifespan was originally one hundred and fifty years. So, this isn't Siona's or Rei's fault. It was meant to be..."
When Tipi left the library and came to the church, Siona apologized to Tipi, and Tipi forgave her.
That's what that meant...
"So, please. Siona, don't cry... Sing... Sing a song..."
"Yes... Yes--!"
"Tipi... I love Siona's songs..."
Siona began to sing. She hiccuped every now and then, throwing off the tune. Even so, Siona continued to sing. To that melody--
"Tha...nk... yooou..."
Tipi smiled--and then stopped moving.
My hand trembled.
It wasn't just my hand.
My whole body was trembling.
Just now, on my lap, another small life came to an end.
If you were to ask others, they might say it wasn't a life at all.
But to me, it was an irreplaceable life.
Siona quietly continued to sing.
Her tune wasn't off anymore. It was the same as always--or at least, it should have been, but the song had a resonance that was clear as crystal.
It was a melody dedicated to Tipi.
Something hot streamed down my cheek.
It ran down my chin and fell onto Tipi's cheek.
Tipi wasn't crying, but she looked as if she were.
I held Tipi close.
That small body would never move again.
That mouth would never speak again.
Those hands would never draw again.
That was "death."
Warmth spread through my head.
Siona was hugging me.
Suddenly, my eyes grew hot.
These were overflowing emotions. An unbearable pain, an uncontrollable sadness... and an immense grief.
For the first time in my life, I shed "tears."
Tears for Tipi--
After that, our lives changed drastically.
The e-reader containing all the library's books that Tipi entrusted to me.
Thanks to what was once called a tablet, my knowledge increased rapidly.
How to grow crops, houses that can be made with just stone and mud, how to predict the weather, and the many animals and plants that can no longer be seen.
Furthermore, a database of newspapers spanning the past 350 years, up until the library ceased functioning.
I'm sure if I searched, I could even find information about myself.
"Ray, are you studying again today?"
"Yeah. There are countless things I need to remember."
"What kind of book are you reading today?"
"Survival--how to survive in any environment."
The power supply to the cold sleep facility wasn't that great. If that's the case, then I need to learn how to get by with only a small amount of power.
I've already started securing drinking water using morning and evening dew, and the problem of securing drinking water, which was the weakest point of this facility, is improving considerably.
That's right, from here on out, we can no longer simply rely on physical strength to get ahead.
From now on, what we need is knowledge. With knowledge, you can face many people alone, or avoid confrontation altogether--or even win.
It might even become possible to help the people of the town.
I greedily absorbed the "power" that Tipi left behind.
While I was reading, Siona was singing beside Tipi, who had stopped moving.
Among the luggage we brought from town was Siona's older brother's music box.
Occasionally, instead of singing, she would turn the handle and play the music box's gentle melody.
It was a very peaceful and comforting time.
With my current "knowledge," it would be possible to live here with Siona forever.
That's why... I didn't notice.
That there was something wrong with Siona's body...
"Ray, dinner's ready."
Siona, as always, prepared the meal with a smile.
She dissolved the oral block in water, making it into a soup.
It was very similar to the fluffy orange soup that Siona always made for me in town.
"Thank you, this soup makes me feel better."
"I'm happy to hear you say that. It makes my heart orange."
"But, Siona, your soup, is it a little small?"
The amount of soup in the bowl is less than half of mine.
"I'm a Philoid, so if I go into save mode, this amount is enough for me."
"Is that so?"
"Yeah. So Ray, you need to eat properly. If you get hungry, you won't have any energy, right?"
Ah... why couldn't I have noticed?
At this time... her functions as a Philoid were already declining...
She was only operating at a level sufficient for half the amount of energy I was consuming.
As always, I read my books, and Siona sang for me.
While tracing the surface of the tablet with my fingertip, I pondered if there was a way to free the people of the town.
Suddenly, the rhythm of the pleasantly flowing song stopped.
Wondering if something was wrong, I looked up to see Siona frozen, holding her hand over her mouth.
The music box she was holding had also stopped.
"Siona...? What's wrong?"
"Um... no, it's nothing. The song just..."
She said that, and then took a deep breath... *inhale*
And then she started singing again—
"...Ah? What was the pitch again...?"
"Sio...na...?"
"Ahaha... that's strange, even though it's a song I loved so much, just wait a moment, I'll remember it soon..."
Siona closed her eyes and tried to start singing again from the places where she had stopped, over and over.
But the melody that flowed from her mouth was completely different from what I knew.
"What's wrong... I can't remember my brother's song..."
"Siona!? Is there something wrong with your body!?"
I was an idiot. In the end, I was only thinking about myself.
Siona was kind to me, cherished me, and I was satisfied with that, spoiled myself... I wasn't thinking about her.
Even though when we left the town, she was caught in an explosion that lost the artificial skin on her arm.
"Siona! At the time of that explosion, you were actually seriously injured, weren't you!"
Siona thought for a moment, then shook her head.
"That was okay, yeah."
Siona—Philoids don't lie.
But, she will hide words while thinking about humans.
Since she said it was okay, there probably wasn't any damage from being caught in the explosion.
Just as she said—"that."
"...Siona. Can you show me what's wrong with you?"
"...Yeah."
Urged by me, Siona hesitated only once before nodding.
I almost averted my eyes in embarrassment at the suddenness of it, but what was there wouldn't let my gaze go.
Siona's white and firm chest.
There, a small hole was open.
"That is..."
Forgetting that it was a woman's body, I approached the wound.
This is a gunshot wound.
I immediately remember the time at Mad's shop when she protected me from the humans.
"It hit... after all..."
"I was wondering if I was okay, but it seems that wasn't the case," Siona said.
Siona stuck out her tongue slightly and smiled, like a child caught doing something mischievous, but without showing any remorse.
I know that's a smile to keep me from feeling guilty.
Even at a time like this, she's thinking of me.
"...Ghk, Search! MODA-117 Alice mk-17 Maintenance Manual!"
Reacting to my voice, the tablet glows faintly.
But Siona covered the screen with her hand. And slowly shook her head.
Without letting her smile fade.
"It's my body. I know it best."
"But... there might be something we can do! If you had told me sooner..."
No, there's a reason she didn't say anything.
Siona knew it, that she had a fatal injury that couldn't be healed.
That no matter how much I struggle, it's a reality that won't change.
It's something too horrible to even put into words.
The word 'death' floated in my head.
No matter how much I don't want to think about it, it just pops into my head.
"I know. I'm going to die soon. Since I'm a Philoid, should I say 'break down'?"
No, Siona.
You're not breaking down.
I'm going to die.
"Ahaha, I guess I lost a little focus, I can't put any strength in my body..."
Just as I thought her shoulders slumped, Siona fell straight toward the floor.
"Siona!"
I hurriedly caught her, holding her in a position that would be as comfortable as possible.
How long has she been like this?
Why couldn't I have noticed...?
"Breaking down... does that mean I'll stop being me...? But, maybe it can be fixed...?"
"It's okay... Siona is Siona..."
"Ahaha... you know, right now... I'm a little scared..."
"Siona... Siona... ..."
"Don't cry, Rei. Tippy-chan will laugh at you if you do."
Siona's hand reaches for my cheek.
It was my second tear that she brushed away with her fingertip.
"I don't want Rei to turn blue.... I always want you to be orange and fluffy..."
I'm sad.
An immense sadness wells up inside me.
It multiplies infinitely in my heart, never ceasing.
As time passes, that sadness becomes more intense.
Why am I so sad?
The answer comes immediately.
Because you're precious to me.
You were a precious person to me.
Even if a Philoid that looked exactly the same appeared before me, it wouldn't mean anything.
It's okay if you look different.
As long as your heart is still you.
"Rei... you know, I thought of you as family. It's partly because you reminded me of my older brother, but it's not just that. I thought you were important,"
Family.
It's a bond where you believe in and help each other unconditionally, without any personal gain.
That is 'love'.
The emotion I had been craving without realizing it.
I had unknowingly become aware of that feeling.
I had been given it all along... all along.
It's such a natural emotion to have while living and walking alongside someone.
"What's wrong, Rei... don't make such a sad face... That's right, let's sing a song, let's go to the plaza again... everyone will be happy."
"...Siona...?"
"It's something I promised everyone. Rei gave everyone a smile, made everyone feel happy."
Those are memories of happier times. Memories of the fun days we spent in town.
It's probably a corruption of the memory area.
But...
"...Yes, let's sing. Everyone's looking forward to it."
I turned the handle of the music box that was placed on the floor.
A melody begins to flow quietly.
Siona's cheeks softened, and she closed her eyes and began to sing.
I closed my eyes as well, listening to the melody and reminiscing.
It wasn't a long time, but I recalled the scenery of that town I spent time in.
People walking down the street stopped and turned to look at us.
One by one, people gathered in the plaza.
Children, the elderly, someone's mother, her husband, the townspeople all began to smile.
As if intoxicated by Siona's singing melody.
Surely that scene was something that was taken for granted a long time ago.
Humans and Philoids alike, smiling, spending their days close to each other.
It's something we've forgotten... something we've lost that we took for granted...
"Hey, Rei... always, always keep smiling, okay?"
"...Yeah."
"It's okay to be sad, it's okay to be angry... But... after that, smile."
"Hey... if love has a shape, it's surely a round one. Because love never hurts anyone."
Holding back my tears, I smile.
"Hey... if love has a temperature, it's surely warm. Because love warms you as if enveloping you."
"Yeah... I'm sure it is."
"Because there's love, Rei won't be sad. Because love is something that protects, and it won't hurt Rei. I promise. No matter what happens from now on, our love will protect Rei."
I had cried so much that my eyes were starting to hurt.
My vision blurred.
But even through that, I could see Siona's smile clearly.
"So don't cry. Love is always by your side. Because love is eternal. You don't have to cry. Because it's eternal."
I placed my hand over Siona's hand, which was on my cheek.
It was warm, but she had almost no strength left.
It was as if something was spilling out from between her fingers.
I knew what was spilling out.
But I didn't want to admit it.
I gripped her hand tightly, wishing that it wouldn't spill out.
I could hear a song.
A warm melody that Siona always hummed.
It seeped into the cracks of my darkening heart, filling it with warmth.
"I'm sorry, for leaving you all alone again."
"--! That's not true. That's not true!"
I wanted to tear at my own hair.
Only now, I finally realized.
Siona wasn't afraid of breaking. She was afraid of me being alone again.
"I... I received so much, so much from Siona...!"
"Rei?"
I take Siona's mechanical hand with my human hand.
That's right, until I met Siona, I was neither human nor Philoid, an in-between existence.
Siona always stayed by my side...and I was able to become human.
"Siona will always be inside me, I'm not alone anymore. Joy, sadness, anger... I received them all from you. I'll never forget."
Ah... Damn it, I have to smile here.
I have to reassure Siona, but my emotions won't allow it...
No matter how hard I try, the welling sadness makes tears spill out.
"So Siona, don't make such a sad face. I'll be okay. I'll definitely be okay."
"I see... then, I'm glad."
Siona nodded, looking satisfied.
"Huh..."
Siona narrowed her eyes as if confused. Then, as if pushed out by her eyelids, transparent droplets began to cover her eyes.
"I'm sure... that's different..."
I said in a trembling voice, smiling to reassure Siona.
Now that I've become human, I understand the meaning of those tears.
Siona seemed to realize it too, and smiled back at me.
"Tears... they also flow when you're happy, right?"
The strength slowly drained from Siona's body.
Am I smiling? Am I?
Am I able to keep smiling, so Siona doesn't get worried?
"...See you later."
"...Yeah, see you later."
Softly.
Siona closed her eyes.
In that instant, Siona had the most beautiful face I had probably ever seen.
And then, Siona never opened her eyes again.
That peaceful face looks like it's smiling.
As if she's praying for my happiness.
But there's no happiness in a world without Siona.
The life that continues for me now is nothing but a living hell.
Can I endure it?
...No, I have to endure it.
My chest tightens so much it hurts.
All my emotions creak and groan as they circulate throughout my body.
Is my heart this fragile and weak?
Is losing someone important this painful and agonizing?
"Ugh... Aah...!!"
My vision is dyed pure white, and as if to destroy that world, I cried out in lamentation.
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah...!"
Siona said.
Certainly, Siona's love might be eternal.
But, I couldn't endure it.
I understand, this is emotion.
What Siona gave me.
This suffering, this sorrow too.
But, it's not just that.
The warmth that barely remains in my chest, and the memories with everyone that I can proudly say were fun.
All of that too, Siona gave me.
Both of them are mine now.
I won't let go of either, ever.
How much time has passed?
How much time does a human need to sort out their feelings?
I... I kept remembering the time I met Siona, over and over again.
The meals we ate together.
The times we woke up in the morning and exchanged greetings.
We went shopping together.
I went to the abandoned factory and made her worry.
She was so happy when the music box was fixed.
We sang in the town square, surrounded by smiles.
I made a promise... .
I learned warmth.
I learned joy.
There were times I felt anger.
There were times I shed tears of sadness.
And... I received love.
──No... everything was love.
This tragedy was brought about by the foolishness of us humans, who lost that love.
Humans are hopelessly selfish.
We repeat the same mistakes... .
Even so, we will need someone.
It's instinct. Even when I woke up here, I wanted to see a human.
It's the instinct to seek love, to want to walk alongside someone.
I can't even realize such a simple thing... .
I look at the cold sleep devices in front of me.
I had Siona and Tipi sleeping in the few that were left, the ones that were still functioning properly.
They were originally for humans, but this should at least slow down the deterioration.
I wanted to preserve their appearance, even just a little.
Standing before the two who looked as if they were merely sleeping, I mutter.
"Siona, Tipi... I'm going now."
There's no response.
There couldn't be.
But, I continued.
"I'm going on a journey now. Don't worry, it's not aimless. I'm going to find a world where humans and Philoids can coexist."
That was also the wish of that human youth who was eliminated.
If there was a world where humans and Philoids could coexist, this kind of sadness wouldn't happen.
If there was a world where humans and Philoids could coexist, there would be no greater joy.
That's why I'm going to find it now.
"And, if that world doesn't exist──"
I clench my iron fist as if covering it with my bare palm.
"──No, it definitely exists. The world you tried to leave for us humans definitely exists."
Finding it will be extremely difficult.
But, I have the knowledge that Tipi gave me.
And, I have the emotions that Siona gave me.
I have a partner in this world who continues to convey "love."
So, this journey from now on isn't a journey of despair.
"I'll borrow this, okay? I'll come back to return it someday."
In my hand is Siona's older brother's music box.
I turn the handle in front of the sleeping Siona, letting the melody of peace contained within resonate.
In time with that melody, I felt like I could hear her song.
"Well then, I'm off."
A world where humans and Philoids can hold hands--.
I took that first step.
"Even so, I remained hopeful and continued to reach both arms toward the light."
"Are you awake?"
"...Where... is this...?"
"You've awakened from a long sleep. Do you know your name?"
My name is...
"Manufactured by Asou International, MODA-117 Alice mk-17. An individual name has not been set."
"It seems the settings have been initialized. For now, Alice will do."
The man in front of me held out an old-fashioned wooden box.
"What's this...?"
"It was placed inside the device you were sleeping in."
I take the box. It felt very nostalgic.
When I opened the lid, there was a dull golden disc. When I turned the handle coming out of the side of the box, a clear tone began to play.
A very beautiful melody flowing as the metal comb is gently plucked.
"It's a song that's been played since long ago."
A melody that isn't in my records.
Even so, it's very nostalgic, warm, and my chest feels all warm and fuzzy.
And at the same time...
Tears streamed hotly from my eyes.
"Emotional function runaway confirmed. Maintenance may be required."
"No, that won't be necessary. It would be good to cherish that emotion... Only the knowledge was left behind, but it took a great deal of time to recover the technology to utilize it. I'm sorry."
The man spoke to me gently.
I felt a nostalgic shadow in his expression.
It's not in the records... my memories...
"Anyway, shall we go home after finishing all the maintenance?"
"Where to?"
"To town."
Outside the facility was dazzling.
The sky was blue and endlessly high. White clouds flowed slowly, drawing various shapes.
Warm air filled my artificial lungs. A gentle breeze softly stroked my hair.
It was a natural sight.
For some reason, I felt nostalgic for this ordinary world.
And... for some reason, I felt very sad.
We drove along the paved road.
Every scene visible from the window was beautiful.
Lush greenery thrived.
Small fish leaped on the surface of a clear stream.
In the sky, small birds chirped and flew together in harmony.
"Alright, we're here."
Passing through the gate, we arrived at a town surrounded by white walls.
It was overflowing with many people.
Humans and Phylloids alike, holding hands and living ordinary lives.
That sight made my eyes grow hot again.
"Excuse me, there is still a risk of emotional function runaway. The rhythm pattern in my chest is also not at a normal value."
"It's alright. I'm sure it's the right thing."
"Is that so? In that case, am I a defective product?"
"No, you're perfectly normal. You're closer to a human than any other Phylloid."
Those words were very pleasing to me as a Phylloid.
But I don't understand why I'm told that.
I gazed intently at the town that I felt nostalgic for.
In a corner of the plaza, a human child and a child-type Phylloid were playing happily.
That's a photo studio. The Phylloid owner was smiling as he took pictures of a human family.
At a general store some distance away, a human was shopping, and the Phylloid owner was dealing with them curtly.
"Sensei, welcome back!"
A very cute Phylloid girl came running towards me.
"Hello, I'm back. Have you been a good girl, Dorothy?"
"Yes! I drew lots of pictures while Sensei was gone. Look!"
The little girl showed me the picture she had probably drawn, with a beaming smile.
The townspeople are in a circle, laughing.
The picture drawn with crayons is very warm, and just looking at it makes my heart feel warm.
It was a picture that made everyone who saw it feel happy.
"Huh? You are..."
The girl looks up at me.
"Nice to meet you. I'm Alice, nice to meet you."
"Ali...ce? Hello, Alice. Dorothy isn't registered, so she's Dorothy."
"Yeah, me too."
An unregistered Phylloid. If I don't have a primary partner, what should I do?
Perhaps sensing my anxiety, the man next to me patted me on the shoulder.
"What do you want to do?"
"...What am I capable of...?"
"Alice, can you sing a song?"
"Yes, a song. Like this."
Dorothy closes her eyes and begins to sing.
It was a little clumsy, but it was a song I recognized.
"It's a song that's been sung since long, long ago. There's no one in the world who doesn't know it."
The man said, taking a music box out of the car.
He opened the lid and turned the handle protruding from the side of the box.
A clear sound was emitted, and a gentle melody began to flow.
Drawn in by the melody, the townspeople begin to gather.
Everyone listens to the sound, their expressions softening.
I know this scene.
In the deepest part of my memory, which should be completely blank, a small, breathing memory gently taps at my heart.
My mouth moved naturally.
The song, which should be the first time I've sung it, was familiar to my throat, my lips... my heart.
The music box melody that fills the square is very nostalgic.
Wow, that's so beautiful! You're so good!
Yes, this song... it's a very important song.
