──The air shifted.
The pale blue light that had been enveloping me until then receded.
What I saw next was a grimy ceiling.
My right arm, which I extended towards that place, was slightly different from my left arm, which I also extended.
My right arm is made of exposed mechanical parts from the wrist down.
My fingers move smoothly, but each time, a faint metallic scraping sound echoes.
Next, I slowly raised my upper body.
From that, I understood that the source of the pale blue light that had been in my vision until just now was an oval-shaped lid with a gentle curve.
It seems I had been asleep inside this capsule-like thing.
Where is this place?
Who am I?
Why am I here?
Even if I ask myself, I can't find the answer.
Even when I try to trace back my memories, all I have is the memory of the pale blue light.
In order to find a clue to my memories, I decided to get out of the capsule and wander around the room.
Even though I know the act of walking, perhaps it has been a long time since I've done it, as my footing is unsteady.
I paid attention so as not to fall, and slowly moved forward.
The drifting air was lukewarm, and each time I took air into my lungs, dust clung to my throat.
Light from outside streamed in through a hole in the ceiling, revealing dust particles in the air along its path.
Perhaps no one has entered this building for quite some time.
A thin layer of dust spreads across the floor.
What is this place used for, I wonder?
Countless oval capsules were scattered throughout the large room.
Most of them are open.
The insides are empty.
Even if there are some that are closed, there's nothing inside.
It seems I'm the only one in this room.
…No, that's not quite accurate.
There are people who exist, leaning against the oval objects or lying on the floor.
But, that's wrong.
Those aren't exactly people, if I'm being precise.
It would be more accurate to call them humanoid objects.
Those humanoid objects had mechanical parts peeking out from under their skin.
Some had mechanical parts from the neck up.
Some had exposed mechanical arms.
Some had their lower bodies torn off, revealing mechanical parts.
And then, I remembered what those humanoid objects were.
Partners for Ningen, created for Ningen.
The closest existence to Ningen, equipped with not only the five senses but also emotions.
I reach out my hand to a Philoid that has ceased functioning.
The hand with exposed parts not covered by skin looked very similar to my right hand.
This is a factory.
I was made here.
...It seems the facility was abandoned for some reason just before completion.
While looking at my mechanical right hand before it was covered with artificial skin, I concluded the most likely possibility.
Having understood my own existence, I started walking towards the wall.
There was an old automatic door there, and right next to it, an LCD panel displaying 《CLOSE》 was covered in dust.
I touched it with my mechanical hand.
The moment I felt something cold like electricity at my bloodless fingertips, it displayed 《OPEN》 and the door opened.
Can I get outside from here, I wonder?
Is there anyone left in this facility?
I wanted to meet someone.
I wanted to meet a human.
Let's go find them, my partner.
I pushed open the door leading outside.
In order to prove my own existence.
When I returned home, I headed straight for the living room.
There was a broken music box there.
I opened a book I had borrowed from the library and began to study its structure.
As I thought, the gears inside were chipped.
That's why no matter how much I turn the handle, the disc won't spin and no sound will come out.
...But what should I do about this gear?
Would it be possible to make one according to the size written in the book? No, it's impossible.
With no answer in sight, I continued turning the pages of the book.
At the end of the book, there was a list of products for each manufacturer, and a list of parts used.
As I skimmed through it, my gaze caught on something.
What I learned there was that the manufacturer making this music box also made clocks.
If that's the case, then the precise parts might be the same as those used in clocks.
Suddenly, I remembered what I broke at Mad's shop.
That clock... if they're going to throw it away because it's unusable...
If I use the gears and other parts from the clock, I might be able to fix the music box.
"Rei, what are you doing?"
As the possibility of repair came to light, Shiona came into the living room.
"Shiona, listen. I might be able to fix the music box with the parts from the clock that was at Mad's shop."
"Really? Is that true?"
Shiona had an even more joyful smile than usual.
From that expression, I could tell how happy Shiona was.
"But don't push yourself too hard. We can still sing, even without the music box."
Shiona picked up the music box and began to sing.
That song she sang in the chapel.
That song, somehow nostalgic.
That song, the kind that warms the depths of my heart.
Looking at Shiona, who gazes at the music box with affection, my resolve grows stronger.
I want to fix this music box for her.
And I want Shiona to be happy.
That feeling swells up inside me.
"Tomorrow, I'm going to Mad's shop again."
I'll try to ask him to let me have the clock somehow.
But there was one thing that worried me.
That is, I was the one who broke that clock.
I apologized, but still, it's hard to go there.
I'm terrified of Mad yelling at me again.
"You know, I want to make a lot of people smile with this song of Onii-chan's."
Shiona's words reached me as I hesitated.
"This song is orange... I'm sure it can turn many people's hearts orange. Because it's a song created with the wish that it would. Because that's Onii-chan's wish. So, I want many people to hear this song. And I want to make many people smile. That's my wish."
Shiona said as if talking to herself.
Those words give me a push.
I'll go to Mad's shop again tomorrow.
And I'll apologize again for breaking the clock.
With Shiona's singing and the music box, I strengthened my resolve.
The next day, I visited Mad's shop alone.
I can't count how many times I thought about turning back on the way.
Every time I thought that, Shiona's smile flashed through my mind.
I want to keep seeing that smile.
To do that, I want to fix the music box for her.
I recalled yesterday's resolution many times.
What I can do for Shiona.
I steeled myself and stepped into Mad's shop.
"You, what face do you have to show here?"
Immediately after, Mad's voice, as low as distant thunder, rained down.
I immediately wanted to run away, but I didn't.
"I wanted to apologize more properly for yesterday."
"About the clock? You already apologized for that."
"Shiona was there at the time... I thought I should apologize properly, by myself."
"I don't need that. Get out of here."
"I can't do that. I'm truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday."
"No matter how much you apologize, the clock is still broken, leave."
"I'm sorry. I'm really sorry."
With my head bowed, I continued to apologize.
I wonder how much time had passed.
Eventually, Mad's voice, a little softer, reached me.
"...Raise your head."
Doing as I was told, Mad's face, looking somewhat exasperated, was there.
"Geez... what a guy. You're persistent beyond belief."
"I'm sorry..."
"Don't apologize anymore, or I'll punch you!"
He says that, but there doesn't seem to be as much anger as yesterday.
I thought I heard a small sigh.
"You're done here, right? Get out of here."
"Um... I have one request."
"A request? You've got some nerve asking me for a favor."
My legs shrink back from the pressure, but Shiona's words push me forward.
"That clock... could you let me have it?"
"...Say that again."
"Um... that clock from yesterday, could you let me have it--"
"Don't screw with meeeeeeeeeee!!"
The impact was like being struck by lightning, and I froze, standing perfectly still.
"You broke it yourself and now you want me to give it to you? Don't get carried away!"
It's no use... .
I can't take any more than this... .
As I tried to run away, a voice called out from behind.
"Please wait, Mad. Rei just wants to fix my brother's music box."
Shiona, who was supposed to be waiting at home, was there.
Shiona, without being intimidated by Mad, stepped between him and me.
"My brother's music box is broken, and Rei said he would fix it for me. He just needs the parts for that. He's truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday. So, won't you forgive him?"
Shiona conveyed this to Mad with an unwavering smile.
"Hmm... hmmm..."
Mad's face, which had been bright red, gradually softened.
"But, that clock is gone now. I threw that kind of thing away. However..."
Mad turned his back to us, but continued to move his mouth.
"The abandoned factory on the outskirts of town, I threw it away there. I don't know what happened after that."
After saying only that, Mad sat down facing the wall.
"Thank you, Mad."
Shiona bowed without losing her smile and left the store.
"Ah, thank you very much..."
I bowed in the same way and left the store.
"The abandoned factory is very close to where Rei collapsed."
As soon as we left the store, Shiona told me.
"So, Shiona goes to throw away trash there?"
"That's right. Trash from various places gathers there."
"Could it be that you fix things you pick up there and sell them here?"
"That's right. Mad often goes to that place."
I see, that's why there were so many old things in the store.
He probably brings usable things from that place and reuses them.
Anyway, I decided to head to that abandoned factory.
"Shiona, if you don't mind, I'd like you to guide me to that place."
"I'm sorry, the Red Children are coming to my house today."
She must be talking about those kids who were talking to Shiona yesterday.
Come to think of it, she promised to treat them to soup.
"But Rei, you can't go alone, right? I'll go and cancel my promise with the children."
"No, it's okay, Shiona. You should keep your promise."
"But, how are you going to get there?"
"I'll try going to the library. I want to know more about this area, and I want to look at a map."
"The library..."
Shiona's expression seemed to cloud over a little.
"Eh... no, it's nothing. ...Hey, Rei. Is Tippy attached to you?"
"I wonder. I don't think she hates me, but why do you ask?"
"Oh, it's nothing. If it's the library, I'm sure there's a map. Goodbye."
"Yeah, I will. Well then, see you later."
I turned on my heel and tried to head to the library.
The smile Shiona showed at that moment seemed to contain some sadness, or so I thought.
But I don't know the reason why.
"Rei, you came."
Tippy was in the same place as yesterday, shedding tears in the same way.
"Yeah, I came. Hey Tippy, can I ask you something?"
"Does this library have a map of the town?"
"Yeah, it does. It has a lot of them."
"That's good. Will you guide me to where the maps are?"
"I will, but... but..."
Tippy was somehow hesitant.
"No, that's not it... that's not it, but..."
"Will you hold me?"
Tippy's face turned a little red.
Her sad expression hasn't changed, but her cheeks seem a little softer.
"...Hold you? You mean like I held you yesterday?"
"Yeah... is it no good?"
"It's not no good. Here, come here."
"Yeah... yeah..."
When I opened my arms, Tippy stood up and jumped into my chest, somewhat hesitantly.
Unlike yesterday, I ended up holding her.
But my thoughts are the same.
The Tippy I held was still small, soft, and seemed like she might break.
"Tippy, is this okay?"
"Yeah, it's okay. Rei... you're warm."
Tippy nuzzled against my chest.
That gesture warmed the depths of my heart.
Could this be the emotion called love?
I want to protect this girl.
I want to stop these tears.
For a while, I held Tippy close.
"Um, can you walk over there like this?"
Tippy pointed her finger towards the aisle from within my arms.
Still holding her, I headed in the direction she indicated.
"Why do you need a map?"
"There seems to be an abandoned factory near the town. I want to go there."
"Why, to the abandoned factory?"
"Because the parts I'm looking for might be there."
"The music box you were looking at yesterday?"
"Yeah, that's right. I really want to fix Shiona's brother's music box."
"Shiona's... I see. I hope you find them."
Still held in my arms, Tippy led me without hesitation to the bookshelf containing the map books.
"Do you perhaps remember where each book is?"
"Yeah, mostly."
"That's amazing... Did someone teach you?"
"Nope. I learned by myself while waiting for my mom and dad."
Upon mentioning her mom and dad, Tippy's eyes became a little teary.
"Um... is this one, maybe?"
To change the subject, I took out a map book.
I sat down on the spot and opened the book.
Like the music box book, this map was also handwritten.
Could it be that all the books in this library are handwritten?
If that's the case, that's a considerable amount.
Just who could have handwritten this many books?
The task would require an endless amount of time, and it makes me feel faint.
"It's pretty beat up... About how old is this book?"
"Um... I don't know. It's a really, really, reeeeally old book."
It seemed like a map from decades ago.
The buildings themselves seem the same as the current townscape, though...
The pages are severely faded, as if tea had been spilled on them.
Some were stuck together and looked like they would tear if I turned them.
I carefully turned the page.
"Ah, could this be it?"
I found a factory map symbol to the north of the town.
Considering the direction of Shiona's house, this place is likely the one.
"Ray... are you going? Don't go..."
Tippy clung to my neck.
I stroked her small back with my hand, over and over.
"It's okay, I'll come back."
"Really? Will you really come back?"
"Yeah, of course. I promise."
"You promise? You absolutely, absolutely have to come back!"
"Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely."
Again and again, I made promises to Tippy.
I wonder why.
Even so, I hesitated to leave that place.
The feeling that I wanted to stay by Tippy's side forever welled up inside me.
Hiding that feeling, I left the library.
Entering the abandoned factory, which I reached with the map, the smell of oxidized oil stung my nose.
This factory, too, probably used to make Philoid arms and legs.
All around, unfinished Philoid arm and leg parts were scattered everywhere.
All of them are before being covered with artificial skin, with the machine parts exposed.
Looking closely, I can see that they are made in the same way as my right hand.
Even knowing they are artificial, this sight was bizarre.
To move a rolling arm out of the way, I pushed it aside with my right hand.
The lonely sound of metal colliding echoed through the factory.
If, by some chance, any part of my body breaks down, I'll come here.
Here, there are mountains of replacement parts.
In the back, there were many drums filled with oxidized oil rolling around.
Most of it has oxidized, but there was also some unopened oil inside.
Even if I run out of oil, I can perform maintenance here without being seen.
The further I went into the factory, the more the worries I had in the back of my mind were resolved.
This abandoned factory should become an important place for me.
But, I can't find the most important thing.
That is, of course, the watch that Mad-san threw away in this place.
But, inside this factory, there isn't even anything that looks like trash, let alone a watch.
Could it be that the trash was thrown outside, not inside the factory?
I decided to leave the factory for now and go around its perimeter.
Then, on the back side of the factory, I was able to find an area where machine parts were piled high.
There are machine parts, of course, but also a lot of trash is thrown away.
Surely this town's garbage dump is here.
Besides Mad, there must be others who have taken things that looked useful from here.
Looking up at the mountain that was many times my height, I thought that.
"...Now, where could it be?"
There's a considerable amount of trash.
It would be a lot of work to search diligently and find it.
But, there's no other way.
I decided to start searching from my feet right away.
I don't know how much time has passed.
I had long since lost my sense of time.
Because I was moving muddy metal plates and containers covered in waste oil, my hands were covered in sludge.
My clothes were covered in oil, and before I knew it, there were a lot of stains.
After that, I crossed carpets of trash, swam in rivers of filth, and was hit by waterfalls of scrap.
And then, I finally found it.
It was in Mad's shop.
The one I broke yesterday.
That watch.
I picked it up and stared intently at the hands on the face.
Of course, it's not moving.
I put the watch to my ear, but it didn't make any sound.
It's only natural since I broke it.
This watch will probably never tick again.
That fact pricked the depths of my heart slightly.
Gently, I hugged the watch and decided to start heading home.
Siona will greet me kindly.
"I'm home. I found it."
When I held out the oil-stained trophy, Siona smiled gently.
"Really, thank you. Here, change your clothes, change your clothes."
Siona had prepared a towel and a change of clothes for me.
After wiping off the dirt and changing, I headed to the living room.
Siona greeted me there as well.
"Ray, you must be tired? Eat and rest."
"No, I'm okay. I want to start working right away."
"Are you okay? I'm worried about your body, Ray."
"I'm fine. Strangely, I'm not feeling tired right now."
"But, you have to eat..."
"Yeah, I know. I'll eat later, so you go ahead and eat."
"...Okay, I understand. Good luck."
Siona leaves the living room.
I watched her go, and then I started working.
I opened the book I borrowed from the library beside me.
This music box has a mechanism where, by turning the handle, gears of various sizes inside intricately mesh together, keeping the disc rotating at a constant speed.
Apparently, turning the handle faster doesn't necessarily make the song faster.
I thought that was a very impressive technology.
Following the assembly instructions written in the book in reverse order, I disassembled the music box.
Then, as I compared the parts one by one to check for missing pieces, I found that a gear in the power transmission section was cracked.
So, even with something that moves with such precision, it only takes one small part failing to make it stop working.
I couldn't help but look at my own right hand.
For now, I'll try to find a gear from the watch that's the same size as this cracked one.
I then started disassembling the watch.
I removed the lid and used a screwdriver to remove the screws.
When I removed the cover, the internal structure was revealed.
Gears much more precise than those in the music box mesh together in multiple layers.
One of them, a slightly larger gear, had a broken axle. That's why the parts aren't turning.
This must be the place I broke yesterday.
The fact that Mad discarded this watch probably means he didn't have a gear of the same size.
Fortunately, the broken gear wasn't the size needed for the music box.
Disassembling things makes me feel somewhat reluctant.
Because I'm breaking this watch in order to fix the music box.
Perhaps it's because I understand for myself what kind of existence I am.
Hesitantly, but as a small offering, I disassembled the watch as carefully as possible.
I lined up the watch gears on the table from smallest to largest, comparing them to the ones from the music box.
"...Found it."
I was able to find a gear that seemed to be almost the same size.
Now, all that's left is to transplant this into the music box according to the book.
"I think this should work..."
With this, the disc should move without any problems.
I put the lid back on and turned the handle, and I felt some resistance.
But the handle won't turn any further.
I wonder why.
I reread the book.
The parts and the positions where they're assembled are all correct.
Tilting my head in confusion, I removed the lid again.
Then, I tried turning the handle as it was.
The gears were indeed meshing together perfectly.
But it seems the oil has completely dried up because it hasn't been used for a while.
That must be the reason why the handle won't turn.
What should I do?
Should I go to Shiona and borrow some cooking oil?
...No, that's also a problem.
Cooking oil and gear lubricant are probably different types.
It might work at first, but it could cause a breakdown.
Then, what should I do...?
Suddenly, I looked at my right hand.
Although it's covered by a glove, there are exposed mechanical parts underneath.
What about using the oil used in my hand?
I took off the glove and looked closely at my right hand.
Exposed mechanical parts.
Oil is built inside to smoothly move those parts.
I inserted a screwdriver into the palm near the base of my thumb.
When I removed the exterior, it was packed with mechanisms such as wiring, cylinders, and shafts to move the mechanical hand.
One of the cylinders inside contained oil.
And it was detachable so that the old oil could be easily replaced.
I removed the cylinder with my left hand and dripped the oil that filled it onto the gears of the music box.
I spread the oil with my fingertip so that it would blend into all the gears as much as possible.
Will it work?
I returned the cylinder to my right hand and reattached the exterior.
I hid the mechanical arm with the glove, and then cautiously turned the handle.
Stiffly at first, but as I turned the handle, the gears ran more smoothly.
The oil must have circulated through all the gaps in the gears; the handle continued to turn without any snag.
And that melody begins to play.
"Ray, that song...!"
Shiona suddenly came into the room.
"Yeah. It's fixed, Shiona."
"Thank you... thank you, Ray. Thank you... I'm so, so happy."
Shiona showed me a smile I had never seen before.
Just looking at that smile, the depths of my heart warmed up gently.
And then, I realized.
Ah, so this is it.
This is the emotion called happiness.
I am happy now.
I am happy to see Shiona's smile.
And, for the first time, I was able to gain a sense of being useful.
"Thank you, Ray, thank you."
Shiona took my hand and thanked me many times.
As her face drew closer, I felt my face getting hot.
"Thanks to Ray's hard work, the music box is fixed. I can listen to that song again, which I had given up on. This orange-colored song that my brother made. This song that I love so much..."
"Hey, Shiona, sing it. Let me hear your brother's song."
"Yes... of course!"
I turn the handle of the music box.
Shiona put her hands together in front of her chest and began to sing along with the melody.
The song she was singing when we first met.
The song Shiona's brother made.
An orange-colored song.
I feel like I understand its meaning now.
The emotion dwelling in my heart is joy.
Shiona's song.
And Shiona, singing so happily.
Just watching her like that, I was overflowing with joy.
More than usual, Shiona seemed so happy as she sang that song.
That day, Shiona kept singing until she fell asleep.
I was also absorbed in her singing voice and the tone.
Many, many times, Shiona asked me to play the song for her.
Until my arm could no longer move, Shiona kept singing.
Looking at her expression, I think.
I want to be with Shiona like this forever.
If Shiona wishes for it, I can be with her forever.
But for that to happen, my true identity must never be revealed.
Never, absolutely never...
That day, I solidified my resolve to stay with Shiona forever.
Night, the room darkened.
On the two beds placed side by side, Shiona speaks to me.
"Will you listen to my request?"
"You see, I want many people to listen to this song. And I want to make them smile. I want to make many people happy with this song that my brother made."
I only know the words.
But I didn't understand what it was.
Is it a state?
Or is it an emotion?
I repeat the word 'happiness' over and over in my head.
"So, I want you to help me."
"Help? How should I do it?"
"Tomorrow, I want you to go to the plaza with me. And I want you to play the music box."
"And then, Shiona will sing, right?"
"Yes, that's right. And I want as many people as possible to listen. To that orange-colored song that my brother made..."
"Yes, I want to do that too. Of course, I'll help."
I heard the sound of the sheets rubbing together.
"What's wrong, Shiona?"
"Hey, Rei... can I hold your hand?"
I can't see Shiona's expression in the darkness.
But I felt like Shiona's face was turning red.
"Hand? With me?"
"Yes, I want to hold hands with Rei... is that... not okay...?"
I search through my knowledge.
I know the act of holding hands.
But what does it mean for a boy and girl of our age...
"No, it's okay..."
If I'm being asked by a human... by Shiona, then I want to respond.
Fortunately, she is on my left side.
If it's the hand covered in artificial skin, I don't think there'll be a problem.
I reach my hand out to the bed next to me.
In the cold room, my outstretched hand felt a little chilly.
I search for Shiona's hand in the air.
Touching, warmth.
Shiona's hand overlapped mine.
"You're warm, Rei."
"Yeah... you're warm, Shiona."
We held hands.
Without either of us saying anything, we intertwined our fingers.
A warmth spread, not just from the warmth emitted from our hands.
Is this the warmth of a human, different from my artificial warmth...?
"Rei... tighter, please."
“…Like this…?”
“Sorry, did that hurt?”
“No… it was just stronger than I expected.”
“Is this strength okay?”
“Yeah… thank you, Rei.”
We held hands all night long.
Until morning woke us up, our hands remained connected.
The next day, the plaza was overflowing with sound.
The melody that Shiona and I began to play.
Shiona sings.
I'm winding up Shiona's older brother's music box.
At first, there was no one passing by.
But as if drawn in by Shiona's singing voice, the number increased.
One person, then two, stopped, and soon a small circle formed.
That circle quickly grew larger, and the deserted plaza was soon bustling with activity.
Everyone there was listening intently to Shiona's singing voice.
A young couple was close together, holding each other's hands.
An old man closed his eyes, deeply moved.
A young man gazed at a woman a little distance away.
A young parent and child laughed happily together.
The children were moving their bodies to the rhythm of the song.
Each person was listening to Shiona's song with their own thoughts and feelings.
But there was one thing they all had in common.
That was that everyone was 'smiling'.
Everyone was smiling as they listened to Shiona's song.
I felt a warmth deep in my chest, feeling that I was helping to bring smiles to the faces of the people in this place.
This is the emotion of happiness.
The emotion I felt yesterday when I saw Shiona's smile.
This is what that was.
I am happy.
I felt my cheeks lift slightly.
I'm sure I'm smiling, too.
It might be a slightly awkward-looking smile.
But that's okay.
If I can get even a little closer to Shiona, I'll be satisfied with just that.
The music box, which I had just repaired, continued to play the melody flawlessly.
The handle I turn is also in good condition.
The sound flowing from the disc reverberates and amplifies within the wooden box, emerging as a clear tone.
According to Shiona, it's an orange-colored melody.
Shiona sings along to that melody.
I wished this time could last forever and ever.
This time that makes people smile.
And I wanted to keep watching Shiona's happy profile as she sang, forever and ever.
Suddenly, my gaze drifted towards the library on the edge of town.
I thought I saw the closed curtains sway slightly.
For a moment, I even saw a small figure.
I know who that is.
That blue girl who is always crying.
It's Tipi.
She must still be crying now.
In that lonely library--.
Just thinking about it made a small pain in the depths of my chest.
It felt like a thorn had pricked me.
What kind of feelings was Tipi watching this circle with?
A circle of smiles that continues to expand.
Everyone there was smiling and sharing the same feeling.
I noticed that there was one person with a scowl on their face.
That person with hunched shoulders and crossed arms is Mad-san.
He, out of place as he is, is the only one with the emotion of 'anger' on his face.
I unexpectedly met eyes with Mad-san, who harbored that emotion I didn't yet know.
It was a time shorter than a second.
Mad harrumphed, turned on his heel, and disappeared into the crowd.
Watching him go, I thought.
I want to make everyone smile.
Those two expressing sadness and anger.
I want to make Tipi and Mad smile.
But, what should I do?
While turning the handle of the music box, I kept thinking about such things.
After the song ended, I headed to Mad's shop alone.
I couldn't shake off the scowl he had at that time.
I cautiously stepped into the shop, which was as dim and eerie as ever.
There weren't any customers.
Only Mad was sitting in the chair at the register.
However, something was wrong.
Unlike before, he wasn't leaning back in his chair.
He was just staring intently at what seemed to be a small, rectangular chip in his hand.
His expression was still stern, but there was also a hint of loneliness about it.
"Um... Mad?"
When I spoke to him, Mad looked flustered and hid the chip in his palm.
"O-oh, what do you want? Why did you come in here without permission?"
"Without permission, or rather, it's a shop, so isn't entering free...?"
"Don't be ridiculous! To enter my shop without my permission, you're an outrageous brat!!"
I'm being told something very unreasonable.
"But, for Mad-san to not notice me coming in, you must have been really focused on that chip."
"I'm talking about the chip you're hiding in your palm."
"I'm not hiding anything like that!!"
"But I saw it. If you say you're not hiding it, then open your palm and show me what's inside--"
"Shut up, get out! And don't ever come back againnnnn!!"
As if pushed out by his words, I was kicked out of Mad-san's shop.
I came to make Mad-san smile, but I'm doing the complete opposite.
Shiona was waiting for me in front of the shop.
Her smile warmed the depths of my heart a little.
"Huh? Why is Shiona here?"
"I was worried about where Rei was going, so I followed you."
"I came here thinking I'd make Mad-san smile. But I just made him angry again..."
"Make Mad-san smile...? That's a very difficult thing to do. So don't worry about it. Mad-san getting angry is just a normal thing."
"But, today he felt angrier than usual."
"More than usual? Did something happen?"
"I don't really know, but I asked him about the chip."
"...Chip?"
Yeah, a rectangular chip about the size of your palm. Mad-san was staring intently at it...
I used my fingers to show Shiona the size of the chip Mad-san was holding.
Shiona's eyes widened slightly, as if she recognized the chip.
Could it be, you asked him about that chip?
That's right. Then, he suddenly got angry--
Yeah, yeah, I see. Rei, it can't be helped.
Can't be helped? What do you mean?
That chip is Mad-san's treasure.
Mad-san's treasure? What's inside?
It should contain a movie that Mad-san's son made.
His son's movie? Is Mad-san's son a film director?
Yes, that's right. Although, he left this town a long time ago and hasn't returned since.
Shiona said, while looking towards the shop.
A troubled, yet still smiling... a strange expression mixed with those two emotions.
But, why is he just staring at the chip? He should just watch the movie.
That's impossible. There's no equipment in this town that can play that chip.
So, Mad-san wants to see it but can't, so he's just staring at it like that?
I'm sure that's it. He's shy, so he won't say it out loud, though.
At that moment, I had an idea.
A way to make Mad-san, who always has a scowl and is always angry, smile.
"No, it's nothing. Shiona, I have somewhere I want to stop by, so go back ahead."
"Somewhere you want to stop by...?"
"Yeah, there's something I want to look into."
"...The library?"
I thought Shiona looked a little surprised.
She's probably worried about me since I'm not used to the town yet.
"I promise I won't be late."
I said clearly, trying to ease Shiona's burden.
Shiona opened her mouth as if to say something, but then closed it.
And once. She made a gesture of lightly biting her lip for just a moment, and then smiled.
"...Okay. Be careful, Rei."
I parted ways with Shiona in front of Mad-san's shop and started walking through the town alone.
The inside of the library was as dim and stagnant as ever.
I headed straight through the maze-like interior without hesitation.
Towards the blue girl who is always crying--.
"Rei, you came."
Tipi stood up and ran over to me as soon as she saw me.
I gently held her small body.
"Yeah, because I promised."
"Thank you, Rei. I'm so happy."
Tipi has her face buried around my stomach.
I could feel her tears flowing through my clothes.
"Tipi, what were you doing?"
"Drawing a picture, come here, Rei."
Taking my hand, Tipi led me as we walked.
There were drawing paper and crayons scattered where Tipi had been sitting.
Inside the drawing paper, there's a picture that's half-finished.
"Did you draw this, Tipi?"
"Yeah. I draw one every day."
Tipi said that and resumed drawing.
I peered into the picture.
There was a picture of a singing girl and a boy turning a music box.
"Tipi, could this be..."
"It's Rei and Shiona. Singing in the plaza."
So Tipi was watching us through the curtains after all.
Thinking of Tipi watching us all alone, for some reason, a sharp pain struck deep in my chest.
"Rei, what's wrong? Is something hurting somewhere?"
The eyes of the girl looking up at me were filled with sorrow.
I placed my hand on Tipi's head as if to comfort that emotion.
"I'm okay, it's nothing. It's a very good picture."
"Yeah... thank you, I'm happy."
When I stroked her head, Tipi snuggled up to me affectionately.
But her face was fragile and sad--.
I sincerely wanted to see this child's smile.
"You said you draw one every day, but are there other pictures?"
"Yeah, there are. Rei, come here."
Tipi stood up, took my hand, and led me to the back of the library.
There, the pictures were.
Tipi must have put them up herself; many pictures were pasted on the wall in a low position.
"This is the picture I drew yesterday, this is the day before that, this is the day before that..."
Tipi explained them to me one by one.
A picture of a young man and a girl holding hands happily.
A young man and another girl visiting the girl.
And a picture of a girl crying alone.
Ah, I see.
This is Tipi's picture diary.
From then on, there were pictures of a girl continuing to cry alone.
Since I came here, Tipi hasn't been alone.
The expression on the girl in the picture seemed to have softened a little.
Surely that was Tipi's own emotion.
But it was nothing more than something still pregnant with sadness.
I wanted to make this girl smile, too.
What can I do to achieve that?
I can't think of an answer.
The only thing I can say is that I'll stay by Tipi's side like this.
Hey Rei, what kind of book did you come to find today?
With a sad look still on her face, Tipi tugged at my sleeve and looked up at me.
I'm looking for a device that can project images... do you know if there's a book about that?
Yeah, there is. It's a little far from here, though.
Will you guide me?
Yeah, okay. Here!
And with that, Tipi spread out her arms.
The bear plushie in her right hand dangled in the air.
"Carry me."
I picked Tipi up in my arms.
Just like before, she rubbed her cheek against my chest.
It's that way, Rei.
And so, I started to be guided to the book I was looking for.
The book was on the second floor of the library--
A corner of the shelf where materials on images from all over the world, such as projectors and projection machines, are gathered.
The book you want to read is definitely here.
The books lined up on the bookshelf were all handwritten, just like the music box books and maps.
However, there seem to be quite a few types of projectors, some that use film and some that use discs.
What kind are you looking for?
I'm looking for something that can project a chip about this size, do you know?
I use my fingers to show her the size of the chip that Mad-san had.
Hmm... a perfect square? Or a square with only one corner missing?
The corner was... like it was missing diagonally... I think.
I didn't get a good look at it, so I can't say for sure.
But Tipi nodded slightly.
That shape, is it the chip that Mad-san has?
Yeah, it's the chip that Mad-san had.
I was surprised that Tipi knew about Mad-san, but it wasn't strange at all since she's the owner of the general store in this town.
Shiona knew about Mad-san's chip too, and maybe everyone in town knows about it.
And the fact that Mad-san is stubborn and won't show the contents is probably common knowledge.
Um, well... if that's the case... then this one...
Tipi points to a book that was on a shelf that she could barely reach while standing on her tiptoes.
That's amazing, Tipi. You really do remember the location of all the books.
Ehehe. I got praised!
Tipi presses her face against my stomach.
While patting her head, I pick up the book and check its contents.
It was more like an instruction manual than a book.
『Mume Company Projector』 - It describes in detail the types of media and chips that can be played.
The internal structure and wiring are also carefully written down.
It seems to be a projection-type player that can project content recorded on a portable chip onto a screen or white wall.
If I can find this device, I can show Mad-san the movie inside the chip.
Thank you, Tipi. I found the information I needed.
"……Are you leaving already?"
Tipi looks up at me with a sad expression.
"……Yeah, sorry."
"Yadaa. Don't go."
Perhaps she intends to stop me from leaving.
Tipi hugs me.
Her innocent warmth shakes my resolve.
But I have to go.
Because I want to make Mad-san happy right now.
Because I want to see Mad-san's smile.
"Tipi, I promise. I'll definitely come again tomorrow."
"Ashita……? Really……?"
"Yeah, really. I promise."
"……I won't disappear?"
"No, I won't disappear. I'll come see you every day, without fail."
"……I understand. I'll be waiting."
With lingering feelings, I left the library, leaving behind the blue-haired girl--Tipi.
"You came back! What do you want!!!"
As soon as I visited the shop, Mad's roar greeted me.
I want to run away.
I want to cover my ears.
But I didn't.
Because I wanted to fulfill Mad's wish.
"Mad, I have a request. Please lend me your son's chip."
"The chip that contains your son's movie."
"Why should I lend it to you? Don't be ridiculous!"
"Please... please."
"Enough with your meddling! It's a nuisance!"
"I... I want to be helpful to Mad!!"
"Helpful, you say?"
Mad's gaze sharpens even further, and fear begins to take hold, constricting my throat.
I can't put any strength into the movable parts of my knees, and I feel lightheaded.
I want to run away right now... but I can't hesitate here.
I heard about the chip from Shiona. That your son left town to become a movie director. And that movie was sent from your son, right? But you couldn't watch it because you didn't have the right playback device, am I wrong?
I spoke quickly, trying to suppress my fear.
Perhaps taken aback by my momentum, Mad looked at me with a slightly surprised expression.
I just went to the library. To find out what kind of device is needed to play it.
You... you went to the library...?
Mad looked even more surprised at the word 'library'.
Yes... I'll find a device that can play that chip. If the player is broken, I'll fix it. If I can't find one, I'll even build one by piecing together various parts.
Why would you go so far? It's none of your business.
It may be true that it's none of my business. But I want to do it.
I just want to be helpful to Mad... that's all. So, please.
Silence follows.
Is this a silence of affirmation, or--
That guy was the worst, most idiotic son.
Mad sat down in his chair and looked up at the ceiling.
And with a somewhat sad expression, he began to tell me his story.
All we ever did was fight.
Every time we saw each other, a fight would start.
So, at some point, he started avoiding me.
No, maybe I was the one avoiding him.
Anyway, we stopped seeing each other as much.
So when he said he wanted to talk, I was surprised.
"I'm leaving this town."
"Leaving town? What are you talking about?"
"I'm leaving this town to become a movie director. I guess I really do love movies."
"Stop talking about dreams and face reality. Someone like you can't be a director. There's no way you can do it."
"Don't just assume it's impossible! You won't know until you try!"
"I know. I'm your father. No one will watch a movie by a director without talent."
"There are people who recognize me! I've gotten results! You're just the one who won't acknowledge it!"
"You can't even dream in a town like this!"
"A town like this? Say that again."
"I'll say it as many times as you want. I can't stand a life spent in a town like this, in a shop like this, for the rest of my life."
"You... enough..."
"I'll say it as many times as I want! You're just afraid of changing!"
"Ever since Mom died, you've been doing the same thing every day--"
Without thinking, I hit him.
"...You always resort to violence. I've had enough."
"...I understand. Get out."
"Yeah, I will. Just keep doing the same thing here forever."
My son left home.
And since then, he hasn't even sent a single message.
The only thing he sent was this movie on a chip.
How am I supposed to watch it when I don't have a player?
I can't forgive him for being so selfish.
I don't want to watch a movie like this.
I especially don't want to see his face.
I was surprised by Mad-san's uncharacteristic loquacity.
The more I heard his feelings, the more my own feelings grew.
If Mad-san really hated his son, he wouldn't need to keep a chip he can't play forever.
If his son hated Mad-san, he wouldn't have sent him the movie he made.
Surely, he wants Mad-san to see this movie.
I think he sent that chip to Mad-san with some kind of feeling.
That's why I want to show Mad-san this movie.
I bowed my head again.
"Please! Let me borrow the chip!"
Mad-san came in front of me silently.
I was prepared to be yelled at, but I no longer felt fear.
More than that, I had a stronger desire to be helpful to Mad-san.
But Mad-san handed me the chip he was holding.
"Do what you want."
I looked at the chip I received again.
It was a metal core covered with organic glass, with iridescent electronic circuits running through it.
It was also in my knowledge. A general-purpose chip also used for Philoid's memory backup.
It had become a world standard, and most manufacturers had adopted this format.
If that's the case, it might be playable even without a Mume Corporation projector.
I clenched the chip and bowed my head toward Mad.
A deserted factory on the outskirts of town.
I had stepped into the mountain of garbage behind it.
I thought that if there was any equipment to play Mad's chip, it would be in this abandoned factory.
If it were in the town, he would have played it long ago.
There is a lot of equipment mixed in with the garbage.
Wiring that has been cut off, things that have rusted.
As far as I can see, it's all unusable.
The possibility of finding the projector itself in this place is low. But I think I can find some parts, such as a board.
That's right, as I said to Mad, I'll connect the parts and assemble them so that the chip can be played.
This is the only place I can rely on.
If I don't do something here, Mad will remain with that expression forever.
I won't let that happen.
I don't want that to happen.
With only that in mind, I tear down the mountain of scrap.
But no matter how much I search, I can't find the equipment I'm looking for.
Surely Mad must have searched for it before.
No... maybe Mad is still searching for it even now.
Siona said that Mad fixes things he picks up at this garbage dump and sells them at the general store.
Isn't the real purpose of that to find a projector to play his son's chip?
If that's the case, what must Mad be feeling, having been unable to find it until now...?
Instead of a projector, he picks up something else... what was he thinking when he was repairing it...?
I broke Mad's watch.
Ah... I see... so that's why Mad was angry.
That watch was something in the process of trying to regain something important to Mad.
This is speculation. But I want it to be that way.
If that's the case, there's no way I'll be able to easily find what Mad has been searching for all along.
Even so, I won't give up.
Finding the projector should be the greatest atonement for me to Mad, who broke the watch...
It was when I dragged a piece of equipment larger than my body.
I felt a strange sensation in my right hand.
A very small discomfort... I feel awkwardness in the movement of the joints of my fingers.
Is it out of oil, or has something broken down?
If I continue working like this, it might not be good.
I couldn't stop moving my hands.
Mad must have searched within the range I can see.
I look up at the mountain of scrap iron piled far higher than my own height.
If it's me, who weighs less than Mad-san, I might be able to climb it.
As soon as I thought that, I started climbing the unkempt, awkward stairs.
I could feel the water hitting my back.
Large raindrops were pouring down from the sky I looked up at.
"Rei, let's stop now."
A voice came from a position lower than my feet.
When I turned around, Siona was there.
She's looking up at me, getting wet in the rain.
"It's raining. You'll catch a cold if you stay like this."
"I'm okay, I'll look a little more, thank you."
"Even if you don't find it, Mad-san will be happy that you worked so hard."
"I'm okay, Siona. Just a little more."
I continued working.
From behind me, Siona talks to me unilaterally.
"But you're already soaking wet. Let's stop. You're tired, aren't you? No one will blame Rei for giving up."
As if to soothe me.
"I'm worried about your body, let's stop? I'll be sad if you get hurt, Rei... Giving up is also important."
"There might be other ways, so let's go home today. I'm preparing orange fluffy soup."
"Let's go home... Rei, let's go home... Hey, Rei... I'm worried about you, Rei..."
Even so, I continued.
Undeterred by the pouring rain, I kept searching.
I pulled out a rusted iron plate.
At that moment, a small avalanche of scrap occurred.
I retreated, dodging the scrap metal that came piercing down at my feet with a roar.
"That's dangerous, Rei!"
I turned around at Siona's voice, and a mountain of scrap metal pouring down from behind jumped into my eyes.
The mountain piled up behind me was also avalanching in the same way.
While being swallowed up, I somehow ran up the collapsing scrap metal.
After a while, the avalanche subsided, and only the sound of rain remained in the area again.
"Are you okay, Rei? Are you hurt?"
"Yeah, somehow... that was close."
"Really... I'm glad you're safe, so glad..."
Siona let out a sigh of relief.
As if to prove I was safe, I stood up.
"Ah... Rei, that."
Siona pointed at my feet with wide eyes.
The mountain of scrap metal that had collapsed earlier. Among it, there was a piece of equipment I recognized.
It was the same equipment that was in the book Tipi had shown me.
I dug it out, and when I looked at the surface of the device, it was marked with the faded letters 'Mume'.
"I found it... Siona, this is it! I found it!"
I lifted it up high so Siona could see it.
The water that had accumulated inside flowed out as I tilted it.
"I did it, I did it, Siona! I finally found it! Now Mad-san will let us watch a movie!"
"Yeah, but... I think that machine is broken...?"
"Huh?"
Siona said, and I brought the hand holding the device in front of my eyes.
Certainly, the device I found—'a Myuumu-brand projector'—had obvious signs of damage.
The lens needed for projection was missing.
Also, there was a large crack in the top, and when I peeked inside, the internal circuitry was covered in rust.
With this, we can't project a movie.
"That's too bad... Rei, shall we go home now?"
Siona's hand was offered to me.
I placed my hand on top of that hand.
Its warmth warmed my rain-chilled hand.
By the time we returned to town, the rain had stopped.
But the inside of my heart did not clear up.
Can I really repair the projector that I'm holding in both hands?
In my heart, I was determined to fix it, but now that I've seen how battered it is, that resolve is wavering.
"What's wrong, getting all soaked like that?"
I was unexpectedly stopped on the way back to the church.
Standing there when I turned around was the director of the photo studio who had taken our picture before.
「I was just looking for something.」
「Looking for something...? I see. So, did you find what you were looking for?」
「Yes... but...」
「Is something the matter?」
「We found it, but it's broken and unusable.」
Siona answered for me, as I was feeling dejected.
「I see. That's too bad. By the way, what were you planning to use it for?」
「Actually... I wanted to play the chip that Mad has.」
「Mad's? The chip that was sent by his son, right?」
「...Yes. I wanted to make Mad-san, who is always angry, happy...」
「Is that something you truly want to do from the bottom of your heart?」
The director asked gently, yet as if testing me.
「Yes, of course.」
I answered without hesitation.
「Mad-san... always has an angry face and looks very pained. I think if there's a chance, he'll smile. I think people can be happy if they can laugh. And I think other people who see that can be happy too.」
Having said that much, I looked at Siona.
「I... learned that from Siona.」
Siona looked surprised at my words, but soon smiled.
Yes, that's the expression. Someone's smile makes the people around them feel happy too.
The moment Siona smiled at me, my heart also warmed.
"I see... Could you show it to me?"
The director pointed to the projector I was holding. I silently handed over the broken device.
The photo studio director carefully examined the device.
"I see, this is terrible. There are too many missing parts to fix it."
Hearing that from the director, who always takes care of cameras, makes me feel discouraged.
Perhaps noticing my depressed mood, the director returned the projector with a wry smile.
"Rei, let's go home soon? You'll catch a cold."
"That's right. It's bad for your health to stay wet in the rain. You should go home and change first."
Any more than this and we'll be troubling the director too much.
Even if I'm okay, Siona the human will catch a cold.
Hugging the projector, we bowed to the director and headed to the church.
When we returned to the church, Siona wiped my head with a fluffy towel.
Gently, softly, patting carefully so as not to rub.
"That's too bad about the projector."
"...Yeah, but that place was originally a garbage dump, so it's only natural that it's broken."
It's something I should have realized if I'd thought about it a little. But I was hoping for a convenient outcome.
That if I wished for it, something would happen. That if I worked hard, the results would definitely follow.
I'm made to realize that reality isn't that sweet.
It can't be helped. Rei did his best, so no one will complain.
But... but, I wanted to show Mad-san the movie.
Yeah... Rei, you're kind.
It's not kindness or anything like that. I just think it's my role.
But, just that feeling will make Mad-san happy. That's enough.
I hope so...
For now, let's warm up? I'll get you something to drink that will warm your body and soul.
Folding the towel she used to wipe my head, Siona smiled and headed towards the kitchen.
I sat down on a chair and sighed.
I look at the broken projector on the table.
...No, there's no point in being depressed.
Even though it's broken, if you think about it from where there was nothing, it's a little progress.
If I fix this projector little by little, I should be able to play the chips someday.
The book I borrowed from Tipi has instructions on how to disassemble it for maintenance.
If I unravel that in order, I should be able to fix it.
I can look for the missing parts one by one at that factory.
I want Mad-san to smile. I want to see an expression of joy, like Siona's when the music box was fixed.
I renew my determination to fix the projector.
Just then, I notice that the church's main hall is getting lively.
Excuse me.
Opening the door and peeking inside, I saw the director of the photo studio.
And behind him, even more townspeople.
"What's going on?"
I asked, looking puzzled, and the townspeople offered me something with smiles on their faces.
"This is a part from our broken clock. I thought you might be able to use it."
"Wiring, I was thinking, maybe this would fit?"
"Use my light!"
"No, use my light!"
"I have a lot of tools at home, so use as many as you need."
Various electrical components, wiring equipment, electronic circuits, gears, and screws were placed on the table one after another.
Unable to understand the scene, I was stunned, and the director smiled kindly.
"...Um, what is this?"
"You're going to fix that projector, right? When I told everyone about it, they brought things that they thought might be useful. There might be some unnecessary things, but it's better to have materials than not, right?"
"But, why would you do this...?"
"Everyone here was moved by your and Siona's music and song. They really wanted to thank you. ...I'm one of them too."
The director took out a lens and handed it to me.
"This... It's a camera lens, I wonder if it will fit?"
I felt something warm deep inside my chest.
And that warmth gradually welled up higher and higher.
Eventually, that warmth reached the depths of my eyes, becoming hotter and hotter.
Words wouldn't come together properly in my head. I wanted to say something, but only my lips trembled.
Siona, holding a steaming cup, was gently watching me like that.
「Siona... my chest feels warm. I wonder why.」
「Rei, that's an emotion called 'joy'.」
Saying that, she approached me and handed me a cup filled with a drink that had a heart-warming scent.
「Everyone is responding to Rei's desire to make Mad-san smile. Everyone wants to make Mad-san happy, with Rei at the center.」
I wonder if I'm being a nuisance... even though I started this on my own.
「If they thought you were a nuisance, they wouldn't have such warm smiles on their faces.」
I looked at the townspeople who had brought the parts, one by one.
Each of them held their parts in their hands, held them up so I could see them, and smiled at me.
「...Thank you, everyone.」
Using the parts and tools I received, I started the repairs on the spot.
I proceeded with the help of various people in areas I couldn't understand on my own.
I removed the moisture, carefully scraped off the rusted parts with a file, and repaired the broken electronic circuits with copper foil.
I corrected the solder that was about to come off using the tip of a screwdriver heated until it was red.
No, no, it's not like that, it's like this!
No, no, it should be like this!
You're both wrong! It's definitely like this here!
No, it's not like this, it's like that.
Noisily, but cheerfully, the repairs were carried out by everyone.
And then, finally--.
The repairs were finished in a patchwork, awkward state.
"Thank you, everyone."
"It's nothing. In return, let us hear that song again."
"The children love it. Please do it again."
"Listening to it with my partner puts us in a good mood."
"Listening to that song... it reminds me of the old days..."
"I love that song, it's so fun!"
An awkward device made by everyone.
It looked nothing like the ones I saw in books.
But it was a one-of-a-kind projector, made by everyone.
I felt more joy than I ever had before.
Everyone there was genuinely happy about its completion.
"All that's left is to test it out, right?"
Hearing the words 'test run,' I looked around the room.
Come to think of it, I've never seen electricity in this town.
The photographer was using an analog camera too.
"Um... by any chance, does this town not have electricity...?"
At my question, everyone in the room simultaneously looked shocked.
It was an awkwardness, like I'd touched on something I shouldn't have.
Even the director, who suggested the test run, had fallen silent.
"It's the library, you know."
It was Shiona who spoke, as if to break the awkward silence.
"This town doesn't have electricity, but the power storage facility is still around."
"That's the library?"
"Yeah, that's right."
It was as if a ray of hope had shone through.
I could feel my cheeks softening.
But Shiona's expression--even though she was smiling, her eyes looked somewhat sad.
The next day, I went to the library with Shiona.
Carrying the handmade projector that I made with the townspeople yesterday.
"I didn't know there was a device like this here."
Equipped at the library counter was a device that could store electricity made using sunlight into portable batteries.
Apparently, it's the only device left in this town.
However, due to the aging of the solar panels, it's not capable of generating a large amount of power.
For this town, electrical energy is a precious thing.
Despite my selfishness, everyone in town permitted me to use such a valuable resource.
--Always saying that they just wanted me to play the music again.
However, there was something that I couldn't help but be concerned about.
I had a feeling that the library held some special meaning for the people of this town.
Everyone's reaction yesterday. Thinking back, Mad also changed his expression when I went to the library.
...No, I shouldn't make strange assumptions now.
I looked away from the battery that was charging and looked at Shiona, trying to hide the anxiety in my heart.
"I need you to sing again, Shiona."
"Yeah, I'll sing with a feeling of gratitude to everyone."
Shiona gives me her usual smile.
Next to Shiona was Tipi.
She's looking at Shiona with a slightly bewildered expression.
Come to think of it, this is the first time I've seen these two standing side by side.
"Tipi, how long do you think it will take to charge?"
"Um... probably about thirty minutes."
"I see, that's surprisingly fast."
"I can only be with Rei for another thirty minutes...?"
Tipi takes a wide detour around Shiona and hugs my leg.
Her sad expression hasn't changed.
But I felt that her sadness had eased just a little.
I stroke Tipi's head with the palm of my hand.
As I stroke her silky hair over and over, Tipi rubs her cheek against my leg.
"...Okay, you two. That's enough."
Shiona wedges herself between me and Tipi.
Ah... Rei, Rei...
Tipi reaches out her hand, seeking me.
But her hand doesn't reach me.
Rei, just a little...
Shiona grabs my arm and drags me to the wall.
--Shiona's sweet scent tickled my nose.
Rei, Tipi-chan is a girl now. Do you understand what this means?
I know. She's cute when she gets attached to me.
That's not what I mean... I don't think it's good to touch her so casually or get too friendly with her.
Why? I think it's fine if Tipi is happy.
That's not it... I don't think it's good to touch a girl of that age so casually.
Even if you say 'of that age,' Tipi is still a child, right?
Girls mature on the inside faster than they look. She already has a pink heart.
Pink...? What does that mean?
Pink is pink. That's why I don't think it's good.
Shiona seemed unusually upset.
She's talking to me with a smile, but her cheeks are slightly puffed out.
Come to think of it, whenever I said I was going to the library, her smile always stiffened.
It seems Shiona doesn't like me getting along with Tipi very much.
Even now, it looks like she's competing with Tipi.
"……Hey, Shiona. Could that be the emotion called 'jealousy'?"
At my words, Shiona's eyes widened and she gasped.
She shifted her gaze restlessly, avoiding looking at me.
It's an expression I've never seen her make before, she who always has a smile on her face.
I reach out my hand to Shiona's head.
"Eh? Rei...?"
And, just like I do with Tipi, I gently stroked her hair.
"W-W-Wait, Rei, what's with you all of a sudden? What's wrong?"
Unlike Tipi's, Shiona's hair was smooth and felt good. A nice scent wafts up every time I stroke it.
It's the kind of hair I want to touch forever.
"R-Rei? I feel kind of embarrassed, okay? Right?"
Ah, sorry. But, I somehow thought this might be a good thing to do.
I don't really understand why, but looking at Shiona now makes my chest feel warm.
A feeling close to the joy I learned about before is welling up.
"S-So, anyway, let's try to refrain from sticking together so much, okay? Okay? Will you promise me?"
Yeah, if that's what Shiona says, I'll do it.
So, I had no choice but to say that.
We return to Tipi's side.
Tipi looked up at us anxiously.
"What's wrong? Tipi bad girl? Is that why you're both angry?"
Tipi furrows her brow sadly.
"It's okay. It's nothing."
"Really? Really, really not angry? Because Shiona's face... is red?"
"T-This is, it's not that, okay? I'm not red and prickly, okay?"
"Hmm... Okay, I understand."
Tipi shed tears, as if relieved.
Actually, I want to wipe away those tears with my fingertips, but Shiona would surely dislike that.
So I decided to suppress that impulse.
I turn on the projector that has finished charging.
A low motor sound rings out, and the exhaust fan starts to spin.
A light at the top that indicates it is preparing to start was blinking.
It's been a while since I've seen an electric light. Me, Shiona, and Tipi, we all stared at the blinking light with eyes as if looking at something rare.
"Um... where's the place to insert the chip...?"
A control panel on the side of the projector has a broken and exposed lid.
In the center of it, there's a place to insert the chip.
I slowly inserted the chip I received from Mad.
The projector frantically flashed a red reading lamp as it tried to check the data inside.
We watched the situation with bated breath.
After about 10 seconds, the blinking interval of the lamp shortened──and changed to a green light.
"This... means it's okay, right?"
Anxiety and excitement mixed, and my voice was strained.
Yeah, the projector is properly fixed, and the data inside is okay too.
Shiona's words made my heart soar. I could feel the corners of my mouth naturally rising.
I was feeling "joy" at the sense of satisfaction that I had accomplished something new.
After finishing charging the projector and confirming its operation, we were heading to Mad's store.
Tipi said she was getting sleepy and stayed behind in the library.
I wanted her to see it with us since we went through the trouble, but Shiona cautioned me not to push her too hard.
I wonder if Mad will be happy.
Y-Yeah... I'm sure he'll be happy.
I hope so. It's something that everyone in town made together, so all the more because everyone's feelings are in it.
Y-Yeah... that's right.
What's wrong, Shiona? Is something the matter?
Shiona has been somewhat distant since a while ago.
No, it's nothing.
Is that so... I feel like something's different...
More than that, Rei, it's cloudier than usual today, and my heart is turning gray.
Shiona muttered as she looked up at the sky.
I looked up at the sky in the same way, but I couldn't tell the difference from usual.
Rather, since it rained, the dust in the atmosphere has been cleared away, and I feel somewhat easier to breathe.
Plus, it's humid and my mood is all bumpy. So, Rei, why don't we relax at home today? Let's get fluffy with orange soup.
I wonder if this air is making Shiona uncomfortable...?
No, I think Shiona's words are hiding what she really wants to say.
But I didn't really understand what that meant.
I don't think Shiona would be mean.
"But, we went through the trouble of making it together. I want to quickly show Mad-san his son's movie."
"I see... that's right."
Shiona fell silent after that.
She's not angry.
She's matching my pace and keeping up with me.
I could see a shadow in her expression.
We arrived at Mad-san's store, and stepped into the dimly lit interior.
"Hey... what do you think you're doing, barging in here?"
Mad-san's booming voice echoed from the back of the store.
He was leaning back in his chair, staring straight at us.
"Hello, Mad-san. Um... this."
I took out the patchwork projector.
Mad-san glared at it as if he were sizing it up.
"What is that? We don't buy garbage here."
"That's not it. It doesn't look like much, but this is a projector that can play your son's movie."
"My son's movie? I don't remember asking anyone to make something like that."
I wasn't asked to, that's true. I did it on my own. But many people in town cooperated to make this. I want Mad to watch the movie with everyone.
Like I said, I don't remember asking you to do any of that.
I understand. I did it on my own. So what I'm about to do now, I'm doing on my own too. Stop me if you want to.
I tried to step forward.
But from behind, Shiona pulled on my sleeve, stopping me.
Ray, Mad's being prickly and purple... you should stop for today. How about we try another day?
Shiona, we've come this far. Mad may say that, but he must want to see his son's movie. If we don't watch it here, he'll probably never see it.
Besides, if he really hated it, I'd already be thrown outside.
It's just a guess based on Mad's past behavior, but I don't think I'm wrong.
It's okay, Shiona. So don't look so worried. It's going to be alright.
I nodded firmly, trying to dispel Shiona's anxiety.
......Okay, Ray. If that's what you want, do as you please.
Shiona let go of my sleeve.
I started walking again.
I placed the equipment on the register counter and closed the store door.
Next, I closed all of the window curtains.
The already dark store became even darker.
It's just the right darkness for playing a movie.
Then, I turned on the projector, which I had just charged. The fan whirred to life, and after a moment, the attached light turned on.
A square of light appeared on the store wall.
I adjusted the lens I received from the photography museum director and focused it.
Mad just stared intently at that action.
"Mad, I'm going to play the movie now. Is that alright?"
"......Do as you please."
Mad didn't deny it.
I'm convinced that's the answer Mad wants.
I placed my finger on the button on the control panel...
──Playing.
Mad stared at the square of light with a stern expression.
Within the light, a story begins.
It's the story of a certain boy.
It was set in an era when the sky was still blue and nature remained.
Born in a small house in a small town, he didn't know his mother.
The father he lived with only provided the bare minimum... it was hardly a relationship you could call family.
And as the boy grew up, the gap between them deepened.
They would fight whenever they saw each other's faces.
Every short conversation was a rejection of each other.
Before long, their eyes no longer met.
The boy returned home less and less, and eventually stepped onto a path of evil.
His father silently struck him.
His brow furrowed more deeply than usual...
The boy runs out of the house and leaves town.
But that was the beginning of harsh days.
He was conveniently used and betrayed by those he thought were his friends, leaving him broken in body and spirit.
The one who supported him through all of that was a woman.
His meeting with her would lead him to the right path.
The boy washed his hands of evil deeds, moved to a new town, and decided to start his life over.
──He had a family.
A son was born, and he believed without a doubt that he would continue to live happily with his beloved wife.
But... the woman passed away from illness.
There was no time for despair.
He worked desperately to raise the child she left behind.
However, he was so desperate to work that he didn't realize a gap was forming in his relationship with his child.
Every time they opened their mouths, they would only fight.
Days of drifting apart continued.
And the grown-up child, as if to spite him, stepped onto a path of evil...
He thought it was a punishment.
Isn't this exactly what I had done to my father?
Now, he curses his immature self.
He thought about how to stop his son and looked at his own hands.
If he opened his hand, he might be able to gently reason with his son with the kindness of a head pat and an embrace.
If he clenched his hand, it would become a fist, and he might be able to sternly admonish his son with severity.
As a father, which should he choose?
──He clenched his fist.
The fist that struck his son was hot, his chest ached as if it were being tightened... and deep wrinkles etched into his brow.
But, while holding his cheek that had turned red and swollen, his son shed tears.
He had been properly scolded, he was loved... he thought.
Hearing those words, he too shed tears.
Why couldn't he have realized what his son had realized back then?
That the face of his father after hitting him wasn't one of anger, but of sorrow.
He took his son and returned to the town where he was born for the first time in 20 years.
The townscape was almost unchanged from when he ran away.
And the small house where he was born, also unchanged.
But his father, who lived alone in that house, looked a size smaller than he remembered, perhaps due to old age.
He stood before his father, biting his lip and shedding tears.
His father silently patted him lightly on the shoulder and muttered only one thing.
Mad's son's movie was a very old-fashioned type of human drama.
I don't know if this is interesting.
If my emotional functions were normal, I might have been able to judge.
But Mad was engrossed in the screen.
He watched the movie in silence from beginning to end.
The end credits finished rolling, and the screen went completely black.
It seems it's over.
Shiona glanced at me once before reaching for the projector's stop button.
The moment her slender fingertip was about to touch the button, I grasped Shiona's hand.
"...? Rei?"
Shiona looked at me quizzically. But I was staring at the screen.
Because in the center of the completely black screen, letters slowly began to appear.
Those letters, probably handwritten, contained a clear "emotion."
『This movie is dedicated to my father』
The letters slowly melted into the darkening screen and disappeared.
This time, the movie quietly came to an end.
Silence fell around us.
Even after I turned off the power, Mad was still staring intently at the place where the screen had been.
"Mad... the movie's over, you know?"
A sigh was the reply to my words.
"...A boring movie."
He muttered this in a small voice, unlike anything I would have expected from Mad.
"It was so boring, I got tired of holding back yawns."
He wiped away the tears that had accumulated from suppressing his yawns as if discarding them, then stood up from the chair and removed the chip from the projector.
Then he clenched it tightly in his palm and sat back down in the chair.
"...Hurry up and get out of here."
He said this in a voice with little inflection, then closed his eyes as if pondering something.
Could it be that the son's feelings didn't reach him in this movie?
Was it just a movie Mad didn't care about...?
If so, what I did was──
My chest tightened, and I panicked, thinking I had to say something, and called out to Mad.
But Shiona lightly tugged on my clothes, interrupting me.
"Rei, it's okay."
Shiona smiled, lowering the corners of her eyebrows.
"Mad just can't be honest with himself. Let's leave him alone for now, okay?"
Can't be honest...?
In other words, everything Mad said just now was the opposite of what he meant?
"Mad is very smooth right now. He's filled with a beautiful light blue. It's thanks to Rei."
"Is that so... if that's the case..."
I feel warmth deep in my chest.
I know this feeling.
It's the emotion called 'joy'.
I'm happy that Mad was pleased with me.
I couldn't be happier that I was able to help.
We quietly left the store so as not to disturb Mad.
Leaving the projector behind so he can watch movies again, whenever he likes.
When we got outside the store, we could faintly see an orange glow on the other side of the sky.
It was a color that seemed to reflect my feelings.
"I'm really glad Mad was happy."
"Yes, me too."
But her smile was somehow sad.
"Huh? What is it?"
"You look kind of sad."
"Really? I'm not. Mad was happy, so my heart is full."
"Really? If you say so."
"Hey, Rei. Shall we have a feast today?"
"A feast? Why?"
"Because it's the anniversary of Rei making Mad happy."
"Anniversary... yeah, it's an anniversary."
"Let's make orange soup and have a 'powapowa' time today."
"Yeah, let's do that. I'll help with the cooking."
"Thank you. That makes me very happy, Rei."
Shiona's hand touches mine.
Without a word, we held hands.
Warmth is born in our joined hands.
The orange sky was eventually swallowed by the encroaching darkness of night.
The next day, we decided to sing in the plaza as promised with everyone who helped us repair the projector.
Since we had the chance, we wanted Mad to listen with us, so we visited Mad's store.
But the door remained closed.
Even though it's usually open by now, a sign reading 'CLOSE' is hanging there.
The store door is also locked, and we can't get inside.
I peek inside the store through the gap in the door.
The projector is left on the counter.
Nothing has changed since yesterday.
The chair where Mad was sitting is blocked by the shelf, so I can't see it.
"I wonder what's wrong, Mad. Maybe he's not feeling well."
"...I knew it would turn out like this."
"Turn out like this...? What do you mean?"
I tilt my head at Shiona, who speaks as if she knew the store would be closed.
"From halfway through the movie yesterday, Mad's bright red prickliness disappeared."
"Bright red... prickliness?"
"Yeah, I think he didn't need to endure it anymore. It was the first time I'd ever seen Mad so calm."
Shiona smiles with a troubled look.
"Was Mad enduring something all this time?"
That's right. He really, truly wanted to reconcile with his son. He wanted to fly to his son's side. But Mad is always bright red and prickly, right? So, he never had a chance.
So, maybe yesterday's movie was...?
That's right. Because Rei showed Mad his son's movie, Mad was able to be honest with himself.
…So, maybe Mad went to see his son?
Yeah. I think he left town.
Shiona smiles sweetly. Seeing that smile, I truly realize that I was able to help Mad.
My chest suddenly warms, and it turns into words that leave my mouth.
That's amazing! That's amazing, Shiona! It's just like that movie! It wasn't the son who went to see his father, but it's almost exactly like the movie!
Yes, it is. It's really amazing. But there's just one thing that's troubling me.
Troubling you?
Shiona's expression clouds over, and she lets out a small sigh.
Mad and his son are reconciling, so what could be troubling her?
I don't think Mad will be back for a while, so I won't be able to get the ingredients for the orange, fluffy soup.
Shiona said that with a serious face.
That's... troubling, isn't it?
Yeah, it's troubling, right? But if I make it while conserving the ingredients I have now, it should be okay for a while.
Shiona relaxes her tightened lips and smiles.
Looking at her like that, I naturally feel my cheeks move.
A warm feeling wells up from deep within my chest.
I don't know what to call this feeling, but I feel very fulfilled.
“I hope Mad comes back soon. I really want to hear all about it. Maybe his son will come with him, too. That would be even better.”
“Yes, I agree. I hope that happens.”
Little by little, I'm learning about emotions. I was really feeling that.
I'm getting closer to the image I aspire to be.
I want to help people more and more.
I want to learn more and more emotions.
That feeling was becoming the biggest driving force behind me.
“Let's get going, Rei. It's getting late.”
“That's right. Let's hurry. I wonder how many people we can make smile today.”
“I'm sure it will be a lot. Even more than yesterday.”
“It's because Shiona's singing voice is beautiful.”
“No, it's because of Rei's playing.”
“Even though you say playing, I'm just turning the handle.”
“That's what's important. When the person turning it has a kind heart, the music becomes warm and spreads out in a fluffy way.”
Shiona smiles as she gently spreads her hands.
“If it were just my singing, I'm sure no one would stop. My singing is only possible because of Rei's playing. Thank you, Rei.”
My face suddenly feels hot.
“I wonder why, Shiona. My face is really hot.”
“Really. Your face is bright red. You must be embarrassed.”
“Embarrassed? Is this the emotion called embarrassment?”
“Yeah, Rei, you're surprisingly shy, aren't you? Cute.”
Hearing Shiona's words, my face grew even hotter.
After leaving Mad's shop, we visited the plaza.
There, even before we arrived, many people had already gathered.
“We've been waiting for you two! Please do your best today, too!”
“My child has been saying, 'Let's go listen to the songs!' since yesterday. Please.”
“Your songs are healing me. Thank you very much.”
“Big brother, big sister, please sing again!”
Everyone we met was waiting for our melody.
And everyone had a smile on their face.
This was it.
This is what I had been searching for.
Doing something, being appreciated by people, and being thanked.
This is what I wanted.
What a great feeling this is.
How warm it is deep inside my heart.
I wanted to keep experiencing this feeling forever.
“Shiona, let's start. Let's make everyone smile.”
“Yeah, of course.”
I turned the music box handle just like yesterday.
The melody overflows.
Shiona weaves a melody to match the sound.
And that melody spreads a large circle of smiles.
Smiles spread throughout the town.
More than anything, that made me happy.
And Shiona's happy profile as she sang was my joy.
The townspeople listened with smiles, just like yesterday.
The circle of smiles widens.
Suddenly—I felt a slight discomfort in the hand turning the music box handle.
My right hand, gloved to hide the mechanical hand.
I feel a slight creak in that hand turning the handle.
“Hey, how was that machine from the day before yesterday?”
While we were cleaning up after the performance, I was spoken to and looked up.
There was the director and the townspeople who had provided the parts.
“It was restored and Mad was happy. It's all thanks to you all.”
“I see, that's good. It was worth calling out to everyone.”
“It's really thanks to everyone, thank you very much.”
“No, it's nothing... but you know, all of that is thanks to your power.”
“Oh, that's right. Because of your actions, people came forward to cooperate like this.”
“But that's because everyone is kind. My actions are just a trigger.”
“Of course, that's part of it. But, you won't know or change anything unless you take action. It's not about who's the greatest or who's amazing. The person who acts first has that much value.”
The director and all the people who cooperated had warm smiles on their faces.
“If there's anything else, don't hesitate to tell us. We'll cooperate as much as we can.”
The director and the others said that and then scattered and left.
Watching them leave, I thought.
“Hey, Shiona.”
“What's wrong, Rei?”
“I really want to make more people happy.”
“Making people happy is a truly wonderful thing.”
“Yes, it is. But being able to feel that way is wonderful, Rei.”
I was a little happy to be praised by Shiona.
I can feel the warmth slowly spreading deep in my chest.
“That's why I want to help and be useful to many people. I want to meet more and more people and help them solve their problems and troubles.”
“If that's what you want to do, Rei, I think it's fine.”
“Then Shiona, let's go look! Let's go help the people in this town who are in trouble!”
“...wait.”
“You see, Rei, I think that's a little different.”
I was sure Shiona would agree with me.
But she looked troubled and shook her head.
“It's certainly wonderful to help people. But, I think it's wrong to force it on them.”
"Force it...? I don't intend to do anything like that?"
"Of course, I understand how you feel, Rei. But, people have walls and problems that they have to overcome on their own. If you help them with everything, they won't be able to grow. Of course, it's important to help them, but first, that person has to really try their best, and only when they can't overcome it on their own do they need help. So, Rei, let's help someone when they ask for it. It's not too late to help them then."
I understood what Shiona was saying.
I was able to understand it.
But deep down, I felt something bothering me.
Why should I suppress the feeling of wanting to help people?
Why shouldn't I help people on my own?
Why, why, why...
At that point, I stopped thinking.
Because Shiona's smile seemed somehow sad.
A few days later.
The discomfort resurfaced.
It was the discomfort in my right hand that I had felt when I was playing the music box.
A sensation so small that I couldn't put it into words.
But it was definitely attacking my right hand.
The discomfort was gradually increasing.
After returning to Shiona's house, I tried moving each of my fingertips one by one in my room.
Then, with each finger, when I reached a certain depth, it wouldn't bend any further.
At this rate, I won't be able to grab things.
This is a problem that will interfere with my daily life.
No matter how many times I try, the problem doesn't get fixed.
Maybe it needs a fundamental repair, like taking it apart once.
I have a hunch about the cause of this malfunction—I do.
It was when I was looking for that projector.
I really overdid it at that garbage dump.
I felt a strange sensation when I was moving heavy things.
I'll go to that abandoned factory later today.
And I'll go look for tools for the repair.
"Rei, it's time for dinner."
Shiona suddenly enters the room.
I hurriedly put on my gloves and hid my exposed right hand.
"What's wrong? Why are you in such a hurry?"
"It's nothing. I was just spacing out, so I was just surprised."
"Did I startle you? I'm sorry about that. I'll knock next time."
"Yeah, thank you. I'd appreciate that."
"Okay, I understand. So, dinner's ready, do you want to eat now?"
I look at the clock.
Before I knew it, the hands of the clock had already passed the top.
"It's already this late..."
"It's been nothing but cloudy outside. It makes you lose track of time, doesn't it?"
Yeah, I'll go right away. Will you wait for me?
Okay, I understand. I'll be waiting in the kitchen, Rei.
Shiona smiled sweetly and left the room.
I took off my gloves again and checked my right hand.
...I have to somehow keep Shiona from finding out.
Even if I go to the abandoned factory, it will be after eating.
I steeled myself and headed to the kitchen.
In the kitchen, Shiona's homemade dishes were lined up.
Rei, have a seat. Let's eat.
Shiona clasped her hands in front of her face.
I put my hands together in the same way.
Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
These words that Shiona taught me.
Before I knew it, I had come to offer the same prayer.
That's how much time I've spent with Shiona.
Thinking that, the depths of my heart naturally warmed.
Huh? It's nothing, really.
Is that so? You have a happy look on your face? You're all glowing orange.
A happy look? Me...?
Yes, very, very much so. Rei, you've been making that expression a lot lately. It makes me happy too.
"Does that mean... I'm 'smiling'?"
"Yes, that's right. You didn't smile at all at first, but you've started smiling a lot lately. I'm happy."
"Me... smiling...?"
I remember the first day I woke up.
That day, the face I saw was expressionless.
From that day on, I kept wishing.
I wanted emotions.
It seems that before I knew it, I had begun to obtain what I desired.
I felt a lightness deep in my chest, glad that this was so.
Now I can be with Shiona and the others forever.
I looked down at my own right hand.
With this hand, hanging limply and without strength, I can't even use a spoon properly.
Reluctantly, I switched to my left hand and scooped up the soup.
Eating with my unfamiliar left hand was extremely difficult.
"What's wrong, Rei...? Oh, wait, Rei, are you left-handed?"
"No... I'm right-handed, but my right hand hurts a bit today."
"It hurts? That's terrible! We have to call a doctor... Ah, but there aren't any in this town, so we'll have to call one from a town far away..."
"No, it's okay. It'll heal if I leave it alone."
This is bad... this is bad.
If a doctor sees it, my true identity will be revealed.
I have to avoid that at all costs.
I want to stay here forever.
"It must be because you overdid it the other day. Working so hard in the rain..."
"...Yeah, I think that's probably it."
"See, you didn't stop when I told you to. I'm worried about Rei's body."
"Yeah, thanks. But thanks to that hard work, Mad was happy, so it was worth it."
"Yes, that's true. But don't push yourself too hard."
Shiona looks at me with a worried expression.
I won't do anything that makes her look like that again.
Seeing Shiona with any expression other than a smile makes my heart turn blue.
"Speaking of which, I wonder if Mad has returned. Has he contacted you since then?"
"Not yet. His son lives a little far away. I'm sure he hasn't arrived yet."
"I see. I hope he contacts us soon."
"Yeah, me too."
After that, Shiona didn't ask me about my right hand.
I quickly finished my meal with my unfamiliar left hand.
Then I returned to my room and began to prepare.
I packed my tools into a bag.
I will probably have to disassemble my own arm.
I need to solve this on my own.
I can't rely on anyone.
That's why I made thorough preparations.
As I was concentrating on the preparations, I heard a knock on the room's door.
Immediately after, Shiona came into the room.
"Rei, if you'd like to go shopping... are you going somewhere?"
Shiona asked, looking back and forth between the bag and me.
"Yeah. I'm just looking for something."
"Where are you going? Is it close? Far? When will you be back?"
"I'm going to the abandoned factory. I'm planning to come back as soon as possible."
"Abandoned factory? What are you going there for?"
"Well... actually, the photo studio director asked me for some parts, and I'm going to look for them."
It was a lie.
It was a clumsy lie, but Shiona smiles at me.
"I see... I understand. Please be really careful, okay? Your right hand isn't in good shape as it is, right?"
"Yeah, thanks. I'll try to get back as soon as possible."
I was seen off by Shiona and left the church.
My destination is the abandoned factory--.
But there was a place I had to stop by before that.
I need to cover up the lie I blurted out.
If Shiona happens to meet the director and talks about me, the lie will be exposed.
If that happens, I'll end up hurting Shiona.
I don't want to hurt Shiona.
That's why my feet were taking me to the photo studio.
"Oh, a rare customer."
When I opened the door, the director, who was polishing a camera, greeted me.
"I'm sorry for the sudden intrusion."
"No, it's fine... I was just about to head home."
"Home... to the church? Did you have some business there?"
"Ah, just wait a moment."
The director went into the back.
While waiting, I decided to look around at the displayed photos.
There, various photos were displayed, from old photos to recent ones.
The eras, places, and people photographed were different.
But there was one thing they all had in common.
That was that everyone had a smile on their face.
I couldn't help but envy the people in those smiling photos.
"Well, well, sorry to keep you waiting. Here, this is it."
The director held out a photo to me.
In it were a smiling Shiona and an expressionless me.
"It's a photo I took before. It took a while to develop. I apologize for the delay."
That's not true. Thank you. But, I don't have any money...
It's fine. It was late, and I took it because I wanted to. I'll make it a service.
Thank you very much. I'll give it to Shiona.
Please do. Still, looking at it like this, you and Shiona's brother really do look alike.
You know about Shiona's brother?
Ah, of course. Have you ever seen a picture of Shiona and her brother together?
Yes, I have. The one where they're holding a music box, right?
Ah, that's the one. Actually, I took that picture.
Is that so...? When did her brother leave on his journey?
It was right after I took that photo, I think. He said he was going to spread music all over the world. Shiona was so sad. She's always smiling like that, but she was crying the whole time back then.
Shiona was? I can't believe it...
...But, recently, she's started smiling a lot more. As much as when her brother was around... No, maybe even more.
Is that so? I think she's always smiling.
I'm sure it's because you're here.
I think it's partly because you look like her brother, but I don't think that's all there is to it.
But I haven't been able to do anything for Shiona.
It's not just doing something that makes someone smile. You can also make them smile just by being close, by their side.
By her side... Then I'm confident that I can be by Shiona's side more than anyone else.
I can see that too. When Shiona is with you, she seems to be showing a genuine smile.
Those words warmed my heart.
I'm connected to Shiona's smile.
Because I'm here, Shiona is--
It's strange for me to ask, but will you stay near Shiona forever?
Of course. I'll always, always be by Shiona's side, and keep making her smile. That's my greatest wish.
Hahaha, it's like a proposal. It's a shame Shiona isn't here to see this.
A pro...posal...?
Hearing those words, I felt my face getting hot.
I know the meaning of the word.
It's a word that humans use to pledge to spend their lives together.
Was what I said just now the same as that?
Thinking about it, my face gets even hotter.
I turn my back to the director so he won't notice my agitation.
Um, well, I have somewhere to go, so...
Is that so? Don't lose that photo, okay?
Yes, thank you very much.
I said my thanks over my shoulder and left the photo shop.
The road to the abandoned factory.
I push forward through the reddish-black earth.
The bag filled with tools is a heavy burden.
I could hear the sound of the tools rubbing against each other in the bag hanging from my shoulder.
The wind is strong, and it looks like it's about to rain.
It would be self-defeating if I went to repair it and ended up increasing the number of broken parts.
Hoping it wouldn't rain, I hurried to the abandoned factory.
On the way.
In the distance, I spotted something white flickering.
But the location was too far away, and there was no way to confirm what the object was.
I still couldn't tell how big it was, but the white object seemed to be slowly approaching me.
I tried to focus my eyes to confirm it.
At that moment, a gust of wind blew.
I involuntarily closed my eyes.
When I opened my eyes again, the white object had disappeared from view.
What on earth was that just now...?
For a while, I stood there, frozen in place.
But I can't stay like this.
The weather is getting increasingly suspicious.
I have to get to the abandoned factory quickly.
Just as the dark clouds made it look like it was about to rain, I arrived at the abandoned factory.
The inside is still full of dust and filled with the smell of oxidized oil.
Immediately, I found a nearby workbench and decided to remove the glove on my right hand.
I'm already used to the exposed parts.
First, I'll try slowly opening and closing my fingers.
The malfunction wasn't fixed, and the movement stopped halfway.
What could be the cause?
I took the light out of my bag and shone it on my arm, peering inside.
It doesn't seem like any foreign objects are stuck.
…In that case, it must be a problem with the internal parts themselves.
I took out my tools and began disassembling my right hand.
I felt a sense of unease at disassembling my own hand.
I am now breaking myself.
If I were to disassemble all of this, would I break down?
Would that be my 'death'?
I wonder, what kind of feeling would that be?
If I die, where will this consciousness disappear to?
And if it were reassembled again, would this consciousness return?
Could that be called being alive?
While thinking about such things in the back of my mind as I disassembled, I arrived at the cause of the malfunction.
The piston rod of the cylinder that supplies oil to the finger was bent, and oil was seeping out.
It's a part I removed once when I fixed Shiona's music box.
At that time, I used the oil in the cylinder to lubricate the gears of the music box.
It was only a small amount of oil, but it must have been the necessary amount for the intricately operating prosthetic finger.
So, even small tears can become big wounds if they accumulate.
However, if the rod is bent this far, even if I fix it halfway, the oil leak might recur.
The most reliable thing to do would be to replace this part entirely with a new one.
I stood up and decided to search around.
Phyloid parts in the process of being made were scattered on the floor.
Here at the Phyloid factory, there's bound to be a part that fits my model lying around.
With my right arm disassembled, I searched the factory.
There were many arm, leg, and torso parts scattered around the factory.
The head parts are so elaborate that you might mistake them for real ones for a moment if you're not careful.
I searched among them for something that would fit me.
Looking at my exposed right arm, I confirmed the model number of the part I needed.
That seems to be the model number of the necessary part.
I searched for the same model number from the arm parts lying around.
Am I using something that's that rare?
Even after examining all the parts scattered around the factory, there wasn't one with the same model number.
The state of decay of this factory is much more advanced compared to the place where I woke up.
I can tell that it's a facility that was abandoned a long, long time ago.
If that's the case, then it's understandable that the manufacturing dates are different and there aren't any parts with the same model number.
While searching for parts in a panic, I discovered something marked 'AR115'.
Its appearance is almost identical to the part that was embedded in my arm.
However, the piston rod and shaft are a little long.
With this, it seems that I can replace it with just a little modification.
I placed the arm with 'AR115' attached on the workbench and began disassembling it.
After successfully removing the parts, I compared it with the part originally embedded in me -- 'HR114'.
It seems that an output terminal that didn't exist in 'HR114' has been added to 'AR115'.
There are no other changes.
I immediately tried attaching that part to my arm.
Unlike when disassembling, the attaching process was a little difficult.
While dropping the screws many times, I somehow managed to finish the installation.
When I moved my fingers, I was able to open and close them as before.
However, each time, a dissonant sound of machinery rubbing together echoed around me.
It seems the lubricant oil has run out.
Seeking oil, I proceeded deeper into the factory.
When the smell of oxidized oil became stronger, I came across a dark black drum.
When I opened them, all were oxidized and unusable.
But in the very back, I found a relatively new drum.
When I opened it, there was a small amount of oil inside with little oxidation.
I scooped up the oil with the oil storage tank installed inside my arm.
Then, I returned the tank to its original location.
After a while, the oil was automatically extracted, improving the smoothness of the mechanical parts.
When I moved them, I was able to open and close my fingers without any dissonant sounds.
I was able to fix it.
Looking at my smoothly moving fingertips, I felt a sense of clarity spreading deep within my chest.
I put my gloves back on, returned the tools to my bag, and left the factory.
Outside, the wind had become quite strong.
I hope it doesn't rain...
I hurried back to town.
--On the way.
A white object had fallen to the ground.
It was fluttering as if being toyed with by the raging wind.
After staring at it for a while, I realized it was a cloak.
With the umpteenth flutter, I could see something wrapped inside.
It had the shape of a person.
Thinking it couldn't be, I rushed over to it, knelt down on one knee, and gently lifted the cloak.
There was a young man with serious injuries.
Blood flowing from his wounded arm -- I immediately knew it was a human.
"A-Are you alright!?"
"U... u..."
As if reacting to my voice, the young man groaned.
His body was painfully injured, and it didn't seem like he could stand up.
There were traces near the young man's feet, as if he had crawled.
The traces were stained with blood, telling a story of hardship.
--I have to help him.
A sense of mission seeped from within my chest into my whole body.
"Please hang in there, are you alright!"
I threw the bag off my shoulder onto the ground and helped the young man up.
Perhaps the pain shot through him as his body was shaken, as he grimaced and groaned even louder.
And then, as if clinging to something, he reached out his hand.
I reflexively offered my open right hand.
Through the glove, my mechanical hand was grasped.
I messed up -- I inwardly regretted it.
But the strength in his hand was so weak that I couldn't shake it off.
The young man slowly opened his eyes and looked at me.
"Y... you... you..."
"A-Are you alright? There's a town nearby. I'll carry you there right away."
"T... town..."
He muttered in a vacant gaze, as if repeating my words.
Then, as if confirming the hand he was holding, he traced the glove with his powerless fingers.
I'm sure he's found out.
He must have noticed the hard texture, different from that of a human, through the glove.
But it doesn't matter.
This isn't a situation where I can worry about such a thing.
"...D...Do you...l...live...in...th-that town...?"
"T...town...live...?"
The young man repeats "town" like a mantra.
The words are weak, as if they're about to disappear at any moment.
I decided to take the young man back with me.
Maybe now, I can save this person.
I put my arm around his shoulder and dragged the young man along.
His steps were heavy, and it took a considerable amount of time to advance even ten meters.
But I wanted to help this person... I was filled with the desire to save him.
"You...since when...town...?"
The man, who looked like he was about to faint at any moment, asked me.
"It's only been about a week."
"I see...I...see..."
I could feel the young man weakening over my shoulder.
If I don't keep him conscious, he might not come back.
"Please hang in there, we'll be in town soon, very soon. It's not that big, but the people in town are all warm."
I desperately spoke to the young man.
If I could talk about something that would interest him even a little, he wouldn't lose consciousness.
"There aren't any doctors, but there are books, so I'm sure we can figure out how to treat your injuries."
"...B...book...?"
"Yes! We have everything. I'm sure we can look up anything. So please hang in there."
"...E...every...thing...?"
"Yes! For sure!"
The young man took a long, deep breath, and then muttered softly.
"...Abandon me..."
I didn't understand what he said.
I involuntarily stopped walking.
"...Me...just...leave me here, abandon me..."
"T-There's no way I can do that!"
"I...was attacked by Ningen..."
"By Ningen...?"
"I was just...just traveling in search of an ideal...but, ideals are...values..."
The young man took another long breath.
"Because of differences in values...Ningen...clash, oppose each other, fight...becoming cruel and...violent beyond measure..."
"T-That's not true, Ningen are warm, they can share many things, and support each other."
"Ah, that is precisely the ideal..."
The young man exhaled all the breath he had taken, as if all his strength had left him.
"...Um, p-please hang in there! Please hang in there!"
I didn't know if he had just lost consciousness, or something else....
Unpleasant thoughts swirled around in my head.
I gritted my teeth, looked straight ahead, and started walking towards the town.
To help this person, even a second sooner.
Before I knew it, rain started to fall, hitting our backs hard.
Rainwater seeped into my gloves, but this was no time to worry about that.
I frantically carried the young man into the church.
"Ray, what's... Wh-Who is that!?"
Shiona greeted me, looking flustered.
"This person collapsed on the way! He's seriously injured!"
"I understand. Carry him to the back."
Led by Shiona, I carried the young man to a room with a bed.
When I laid him down on the white sheets, the rainwater and blood on his body mixed, spreading into a red stain.
There was no sign of the young man regaining consciousness.
"Ray, I brought some water."
I held the cup Shiona handed me to the young man's mouth.
I poured a little water in.
The young man's throat pulsed as he swallowed.
Even so, he didn't regain consciousness.
Compared to when I first met him, his complexion was considerably paler.
"Shiona, I'm going to the library! I'm sure there are medical books there!"
Shiona started to say something, then bit her lip.
I was concerned about her behavior, but right now, every second counts.
I left Shiona behind and rushed out of the room.
And without worrying about getting wet in the rain, I ran to the library.
"Ray, what's wrong? You're soaking wet."
Perhaps surprised by my sudden entrance, Tipi looked at me with wide eyes.
Without worrying about my ragged breathing, I asked.
"Tipi... do you have any medical books here?"
"Y-Yes, we do."
"Please, can you take me there right away?"
"...Okay."
She must have sensed something.
Tipi immediately led me to the location.
"Is someone sick?"
Tipi asked, still facing forward as she led the way.
"Yes... they're injured."
"Is it Ray? Shiona? Or..."
"No, it's someone Tipi doesn't know. So, you don't have to look so sad."
"But... but, but..."
Large tears streamed down her cheeks.
That young man is someone Tipi doesn't know.
And yet, and yet...
To be able to shed tears for that person, what a kind child Tipi is.
"It's okay... it's okay."
I picked Tipi up and gently wrapped my hands around her.
Hot tears soaked through my clothes.
I could feel a small ache deep in my chest.
Suppressing the pain, I rummaged through the medical books.
But no matter how many books we have, we're just amateurs.
We don't know what the symptoms are, what kind of treatment to give, or even which book is correct.
I took as many books as I could carry from the library.
Without worrying about the books getting wet, I returned to the church.
When I opened the door, a melody flowed from within.
It was Shiona's singing.
The song alone was enough to recognize this as a sacred place.
"Shiona, how is he?"
"No... he still hasn't woken up. I've done everything I can, but..."
I ran to the young man's side.
The bandages are likely Shiona's work.
But the young man's face was even paler than before.
I opened the medical books roughly.
I flipped through the pages, searching for anything we could do.
But we were far too reckless.
No matter how wonderful the medical books are, they are ultimately just bundles of paper.
From the start, there was no way we, without the skills, could save someone with medicine.
We were far too powerless, far too small.
Shiona quietly began to sing.
Unlike usual, it was a quiet melody, like a requiem.
"...Nn...this song..."
The young man opened his eyes to Shiona's song.
But his gaze was vacant, as if he were about to disappear at any moment.
"Do you know this song?"
"Ah, it's a nostalgic song... I used to sing it often..."
The young man's gaze traced the ceiling, then turned to me and Shiona.
Suddenly, the young man's expression softened.
"...Ah, so it was here... the world I was searching for was here..."
"What do you mean? What exactly is the world you were searching for...?"
Perhaps the young man could no longer hear, as he didn't answer my question.
He just kept speaking unilaterally.
...A path to coexistence... A world of harmony...
After saying that, the young man quietly closed his eyes.
And then he didn't twitch again.
I felt something spilling out from the depths of my heart.
"Hey Shiona, why won't he open his eyes? Is he sleeping?"
"Even the power we had just obtained is rapidly fading away..."
"Hey, I wonder why... Is he just tired...?"
An indescribable sense of loss hung heavily in the depths of my heart like dark clouds.
Pain ran through me as if the depths of my heart had been churned up.
Shiona hugged me from behind.
Her warmth allowed me to calm down a little.
Naturally, I placed my hands over Shiona's hands that were around my chest.
"Shiona... I, I..."
"Rei... Let's hold a funeral for him."
"A funeral...?"
"It's like a ceremony that's held when someone dies."
"When someone dies..."
With those words, I realized.
Ah, this person has died.
"That's the only way to mourn the dead."
I couldn't move, listening to Shiona's words.
I couldn't quite process the concept of death that had appeared before my eyes.
"Well then, there are preparations to be made, so will you help me?"
I could only nod briefly.
We begin preparing for the funeral.
To mourn this young man whose name we don't even know.
As we proceeded with the preparations for the ceremony, there was only one thing that bothered me.
I had left Tippy, who had been crying so much, in the library.
Is Tippy still crying?
In that dark library. All alone.
"Rei, what's wrong?"
Shiona spoke to me as I stopped decorating the altar.
"Yeah... there's something I'm a little worried about."
"Something you're worried about? What is it? Is it about that man?"
"No, it's not that... it's about Tippy."
"Tippy-chan? What's wrong with Tippy-chan?"
"When I went to get the medical book, I told Tippy everything about that person. Then, Tippy started crying... and the terrible thing is, I left Tippy in the library like that."
"You turned pale and left her there, is that it?"
"Yeah, that's right. So, I was thinking that she might still be crying..."
"...Yeah, maybe. I'm sure she's crying in the back of the library."
I could easily imagine that scene.
Thinking about it, I couldn't stand still.
"Shiona, do you mind if I go check on Tippy for a bit?"
Shiona showed me a smile that looked a little sad.
"There's still a little more to do to prepare for the funeral. So, I'd be happy if you came back soon."
"Yeah, I know. I'll be right back."
"...Okay. See you later."
Shiona still gave me a somewhat sad smile.
I finished decorating the altar and headed to the library.
With the medical book I had borrowed.
I walked through the town, which had become a light rain, with an umbrella.
The town's appearance was somehow different than usual.
As if something important was missing, lost...
I ran through the town of loss and hurried to the library.
The inside of the library was enveloped in silence, as if shutting out the sound of the rain.
--No, except for one thing.
The sound of a blue-haired girl sobbing from the back.
I followed the sound of the girl's crying.
The girl was in her usual place.
The girl was crying while drawing as usual.
"Ray... Ray..."
Tippy reached out her small hands when she recognized me.
I hugged her small body as if in answer.
The moment I hugged her, her sobs grew a little louder.
"Ray... what happened to that person?"
I choked on those words.
"Hey, Ray... Ray..."
"That person... hey... hey, hey..."
Silence had become the answer.
Perhaps Tippy understood everything; she started crying loudly, without holding back her sadness.
For that young man she had never met, large tears streamed down her face.
Ah, why is this?
What is this pain in my chest?
The depths of my chest are being stirred into a mess.
It occasionally hurt and wounded my chest.
Surely it's something overflowing from the wound opened in my chest.
It overflows from my eyes with heat.
Before I knew it, I was crying.
I was shedding tears for the death of a young man I didn't even know.
Ah, I see.
This is 'sadness'.
It's a blue emotion.
It's the emotion that Tippy always carries in her heart.
It's such a painful and difficult thing.
Tears flow endlessly.
I don't know how to stop them.
--No, that's not right.
I didn't want to stop them.
I wanted to keep letting these overflowing hot droplets flow.
Surely these droplets are an act of healing sadness.
By letting the sadness accumulated deep within our hearts flow out, we maintain our hearts.
Thinking that way, I felt the weight accumulated deep within my chest lighten a little.
And at the same time, I also felt that the amount of overflowing tears had increased.
I cried.
We cried.
Sobbing, embracing each other, we cried.
Crying, crying, crying...
No matter how long it takes, the tears never dry up.
Just as sadness never withers, the tears continued to overflow.
"Tippy, there will be a funeral soon."
“…A funeral? What… is that?”
“It's a ceremony to say goodbye to someone who has died. Shiona is preparing for it now.”
“Goodbye…? What does 'goodbye' mean…?”
“It means you can't see them anymore.”
“Can’t see them anymore… No!”
Tippy clings to me tightly.
Her arms were trembling slightly.
“I understand how you feel, Tippy. But you know, that's precisely why we have to say a proper goodbye, because we're sad.”
“Since we can't see them anymore, let's say goodbye and see them off. If we don't, I'm sure we'll be lonely and sad…”
“Lonely… sad…”
“Yes, I'm sure we will. That's why we'll send them off. So we won't be lonely and sad... Can you do that?”
Tippy slowly pulled away from me.
With tears still streaming down her face, she looked up at me.
“…I can. Tippy can do it.”
“I see. That's great, Tippy.”
When I stroked her head, she looked a little happy.
But her tears never stopped.
“Well then, shall we go…? Can you stand?”
“Yes… Just a moment.”
Tippy stood up and picked up her teddy bear.
The teddy bear that's always with her is still in her arms.
We held hands and headed to the church in the rain.
"Merciful God, our Father, we entrust to Your hands this young man who has completed his journey in life, believing in Your only begotten Son and in the hope of eternal life."
"Take away all the burdens of this brother and sister who are leaving us, lead them to the dwelling prepared in Heaven, and add them to the assembly of saints."
"May we, who are in the sorrow of separation, also be supported by the hope of the resurrection promised by the Lord, and share eternal joy with the child who has been called to You."
Shiona's voice echoed through the church, which was overflowing with attendees.
No one here should have ever seen that young man.
No one here should know that young man.
Even so, everyone who gathered here was mourning the young man's death.
This, I thought, is the feeling of caring for others, the connection between people.
Everyone clasped their hands in front of their chests, quietly closed their eyes, and offered a prayer.
Tippy and I followed suit.
Shiona's voice solemnly echoed through the church.
It sounded almost like a song she was dedicating to the young man…
After the funeral, the young man was buried in the cemetery behind the church.
For one last farewell, the townspeople approached the coffin one by one, offering words of goodbye.
May you have a good afterlife…
May we meet again someday…
Eternal rest…
They offered their own words.
"Come on, Tippy."
It was our turn, and we approached the coffin.
Tippy stared intently at the coffin containing the young man.
The tears she had been shedding right up until the funeral were gone, and she was just staring at the young man expressionlessly.
As if she had lost all emotion.
Just silently.
Staring intently, intently at the coffin.
Feeling uneasy at her state, I tried to call out to Tippy.
But, a moment before I could, she opened her mouth.
She muttered that in a small voice.
Several hours passed since then.
Light shone through the gaps in the clouds where the rain had stopped, which was rare.
It's unusual for sunlight to shine through the gray, cloudy sky.
But I wasn't captivated by the beautiful scenery.
Because I was concerned about the expression on Tippy's face during the funeral.
That expression that was too empty to be called sadness.
I don't know what that means.
Even so, there's only one thing I think.
I want to be by her side.
I want to be by Tippy's side and talk to her.
And I want to heal that sadness for her.
That feeling grows stronger within me.
Just as I was about to open the door to the room, Shiona stopped me.
"Yeah, I was thinking of going to see Tippy."
"At the funeral, Tippy looked so sad, I got worried."
"I see... but you know, I'm worried about Ray."
"Yeah. Because Ray, you have such a sad expression."
"A sad expression...?"
I touch my cheek with my hand.
"You can't tell that way, can you? Come on, come over here."
Being led by the hand, I was brought to the living room and made to stand in front of a mirror.
"Look, you have a sad face, don't you?"
My face reflected in the mirror... was pale.
I now understand what Shiona always meant when she said Tippy was "pale."
Right now, I have the same face as Tippy.
My heart is quiet, but the strength has left my body, and my expression is sinking as if pulled down by gravity.
"...Yeah, it's the first time I've seen my face like this."
This is... sadness.
Even without shedding tears, when you're captured by this emotion, your expression becomes this "pale."
"Someone died. It's only natural to have that kind of face."
This feeling... what use could it possibly have in life...?
It's bitter... painful... heavy, aching, and cold...
I look at Shiona's expression reflected in the mirror.
But she wore a somewhat sad, ephemeral smile.
I'm sure she's forcing herself to smile.
Just thinking that made the depths of my chest ache.
"Tippy-chan's also important. But you know, I want you to cherish yourself first."
"Me... cherish myself?"
"Yeah, that's right. Ray cherishing Ray himself."
"Cherishing myself... I've never thought about that before."
"Ray, you're so kind. That's why I'm sure you prioritize others over yourself."
"But that's what I want to do."
"I'm a little sad about that. I don't want you to push yourself too hard."
"I'm not pushing myself."
"Is that so? I can't think that way."
Shiona's arms entwined with mine.
"...I'm worried, you know."
I could feel my heart rate increasing.
I don't know what it is.
But it was certainly stirring my emotions.
In that warmth, I felt kindness.
...No, something more than kindness... I feel a different kind of warmth, different from what touches my skin.
Hey, Rei, shall we have some tea?
......Tea? Why?
When you drink something warm and fuzzy, your heart feels fuzzy too. It relaxes both your mind and body, and it feels really good.
But Tippy...
Tippy-chan is probably shaken up by the death of that person. But you know, I'm sure she can overcome it. So, let's leave her alone for a little while. Being alone is very important, you know?
Is that so?
Yes, I'm sure of it. Because if she doesn't, she can't become stronger.
People can become stronger by overcoming walls and sorrows. But if they are helped by someone every time, they cannot grow easily. To help Tippy-chan grow, shall we leave her alone today?
Tippy is a weak being.
She's always crying.
But, if you're saying it's a chance for her to grow...
I'll accept it.
Shiona, will you make tea for me?
Of course. Will you sit on the chair and wait?
I sat on the sofa and waited for Shiona's tea.
After waiting for a while, a nice scent filled the room.
Sorry to keep you waiting. Special, heartwarming tea. Enjoy.
The offered teacup was filled with an orange-colored liquid.
A faint sourness and a subtle sweetness waft through the air.
Like this. It's been a while since I've had a chance to talk to you slowly, Ray.
Yeah, it has. A lot has happened...
Ray, how is your memory?
No, it doesn't seem like it's coming back yet.
I see... But, there's no need to rush. You might suddenly remember something someday.
Yeah, thank you... But, I feel bad.
Feel bad? About what?
I'm being allowed to stay here, but I haven't been able to repay Shiona for her kindness at all.
That's not true. I'm just happy to have you by my side, Ray.
But that's not repaying you at all.
It's not just that. You also fixed the music box... and thanks to that, I can sing now.
But you were singing even before that, Shiona.
But, it's very different with and without a melody. Remember, we performed together in the plaza? Actually, I had sung in that place many times.
In that place... alone?
Yes. But, no one would listen to me at that time.
Even with such a wonderful singing voice? That's strange.
Hehe, thank you. But, that's how it is. So, I was very happy when you brought the music box with you, Ray.
That's... I was just turning the music box.
That's what makes me happy. Having you next to me, that's what I'm happiest of all.
I feel the same way. I'm happy to be with Shiona.
......Hehe. Thank you. Ray, you've become so much more expressive.
Expressive? Me?
Yes. Your expressions are much richer than when we first met.
That was what I sought, what I desired.
It was what I had been longing for ever since I woke up.
Being told that by Shiona fills my heart.
The incomplete me is getting closer to being human... closer to Shiona, because that's what she told me.
I'm sure it's because Shiona has been smiling next to me.
Is that so? I haven't done anything.
No, it's because you're here, Shiona. Thank you, I'm grateful.
If you're going to say that, then so am I. Thank you, Ray.
I'm the one who should be thanking you.
I'm the one who should be... Hehe, it's funny, isn't it? We're just thanking each other over and over.
You're right. What are we even doing?
......But you know, it's strange.
What's strange?
I'm thinking that I wish this time could last forever... That's strange, isn't it?
......No, not at all. I was thinking the same thing...
......Can I go over there?
Shiona sits next to me.
A distance where warmth is conveyed.
We were closer than ever before.
Huh...? What is it...?
What's wrong?
Something feels strange in my body. My chest... it's pounding.
Could it be that I've broken down? I'd be troubled if it's a major malfunction requiring maintenance.
It's okay. I feel the same way. My chest has been pounding the whole time.
Huh? A-Are you okay? Does it hurt?
Yeah. This is a very wonderful thing.
Shiona gently smiled shyly and placed her hand on mine.
Softly, as if enveloping it.
I responded to that by turning my wrist. As if to align our palms... as if to intertwine our fingers.
I feel Shiona's warmth even more strongly.
And that warmth warms the depths of my chest.
The depths of my chest are warm, like, gently...
My chest...? Here...?
Shiona's hand reaches for my chest.
The place she touched suddenly became hot.
Shiona's hand feels so hot... I wonder why. Could it be a disease?
No, that's not it.
Do you know the cause, Shiona?
Yes, probably.
Tell me.
Hehe, what should I do?
Don't be mean. I'm curious.
Hmm... but you know, this isn't just happening to Rei.
The getting hot part?
Yes, that's right. My heart is also very hot right now.
Shiona too?
Yes, me too. Maybe I'm even more seriously ill than Rei.
That's terrible! How can we cure it?
No, we can't cure it... we don't have to cure it.
My heart is hot, it's tight, it's painful, it's sad, but it's warm... and that's okay. That's good, Rei.
Shiona's hand on mine grew a little hotter.
I gripped her hand back.
Rei, please.
I want you to be with me forever.
Yeah... will you be with me forever and ever?
Yeah... I promise.
Thank you, Rei. I'm so happy... so, so...
Shiona rested her head on my chest.
I felt like my heart was being filled up by that.
It's similar to the feeling of joy I felt before, but it's an even stronger emotion.
What do humans call this?
I wanted to ask Shiona, but I thought it would be insensitive to break this atmosphere.
So, just like this... I'll entrust myself to Shiona and time, just like this.
The sweet-smelling tea prepared on the table. We stayed like that until the steam disappeared.
The next day, I was getting ready to go out after finishing breakfast.
Shiona, who was washing the dishes, called out to me.
"I was thinking of going to the library."
"The library... are you going to see Tippy-chan?"
"Yes, that's the plan."
"I'm sure Tippy-chan is still in the process of overcoming it. So, shouldn't we leave her be?"
"Yeah... but if I think about her being lonely all alone, unable to overcome it, I can't just leave her alone."
Just like Shiona was by my side yesterday and made me feel warm, I think I can support her just by being nearby.
"It's okay. Tippy-chan isn't that weak."
"Do you think so...?"
"Yeah, I'm sure of it. More than that, Rei, I have a favor to ask. Won't you go to the plaza today?"
"To the plaza? Why?"
"I'm bringing the music box... I thought we could sing again."
"Yeah, something sad happened, didn't it? So, it's important to rest your heart."
"Rest my heart...?"
"We had a funeral, and I'm sure everyone in town is feeling down. So, don't you want to brighten the spirits of everyone?"
"...Everyone in town? Of course, I do."
It's painful to see sad faces.
If I could, I'd like to heal that sadness.
"Our melody is what can do that. I'm sure it will help the town regain its energy."
"I see... do you think so?"
"Yeah, I'm sure of it. Come on, let's get ready."
Urged on by Shiona, I reach for the music box.
The music box, which I maintain every day, is always ready to play music.
We set off for the plaza.
A cloudy afternoon.
There were hardly any people there.
"There's no one here, Shiona."
"It's always like this at this time. Before Rei came."
"Before I came...?"
"I told you. Ever since Rei started playing music, everyone started listening to my songs. The people in town are slowly changing. They're going out more, and interacting more. I feel like the connections between people are gradually getting stronger."
"Is it... because Rei came?"
Yes, I think so. Ever since Rei came, the people in town have been changing. In a good way, of course.
That was a very happy thing to hear.
I'm being helpful to someone.
That fact makes my joy unstoppable.
"Rei, you look happy."
"Yeah. Your cheeks are relaxed."
"My cheeks?"
"Yeah, look --"
Shiona's fingertip touches my cheek.
Just that makes me feel a warmth deep inside my chest again.
"My face feels kind of hot."
"Rei, are you blushing? Ahaha."
My face gets even hotter.
It seems what Shiona is saying is right on the mark.
"Well then, Rei, shall we begin?"
"Yeah, is everything ready?"
"Whenever you are."
Shiona slowly closes her eyes.
I felt like I could look at her beautiful profile forever.
But just as much, I want to hear Shiona's singing voice.
So I slowly started turning the handle of the music box.
Shiona's singing voice rides on that melody.
The two melodies melted together, resonating a beautiful tone all around.
Soon people begin to gather.
At first, the people had slightly gloomy faces, but gradually they began to smile again.
And before long, a large circle of smiles had spread across the square.
Town child A
Town person A
Town person B
Town person C
Town person D
The smiles and words of various people are flying around.
Ah, this is it.
This is what I was looking for.
People with happy smiles.
Each time I see those smiles, my joy amplifies.
I was saddened that the girl wasn't in the circle.
The blue girl in the back of the library.
The girl who never comes here.
The girl who remains shut up in that library.
I couldn't stop thinking about that girl.
Shiona's voice brings me back to my senses.
"Sorry, I was just thinking about something."
"I see... everyone's already gone home."
Looking around, the people who had been in such a large circle were now sparse.
It seems I was lost in thought for a very long time.
"What were you thinking about?"
"Hmm... no... nothing really..."
"Shall I guess? It's about Tippy-chan, isn't it?"
My heart was easily seen through. So I honestly nod.
"...Yeah, that's right."
"I knew it... are you really that worried about her?"
"Yeah, I'm worried. Because she's still such a small child."
"A small child, huh... I guess so."
"Besides, she's always all alone. There's no way she's not lonely."
"But that's how it's always been. She's used to it now."
"That's not true."
"After all, Shiona, you said it yourself. That the townspeople have changed since I came."
"Yeah, that's true..."
"Then I want Tippy to change too. Staying lonely like that isn't right."
I say what Shiona taught me, as if returning the words to her.
Hearing those words, Shiona's smile clouded over slightly.
She looked towards the library, pursed her lips for a moment, and then turned back to me with a smile.
"Rei, shall we go home?"
"It's going to rain from noon today. Come on, let's go home... okay? I'll make fluffy white soup for you."
Taking Shiona's hand, I was half-forced to leave the plaza.
Then, a few hours later.
Shiona stopped me again as I was about to leave the house.
"Um, I was thinking I'd like to read a book..."
"If it's books, there are a few that my brother used to read."
"Not those... well, it's a genre of book that I'm sure isn't here."
"What kind of genre is it?"
"Books about machines. I've been interested ever since I fixed Mad's the other day."
"I see. I'm happy that Rei is interested in something."
"Yeah, thank you. So, I'm going to go to the library."
"Does it have to be today?"
"Yeah, sooner is better. I want to read it as soon as possible."
"But, it's going to rain soon, you know?"
"The weather doesn't matter. I'll go even if it rains."
"But the book might get wet, you know?"
"It's okay, I'll take a bag with me."
"Hmm... then I'll go and borrow it for you."
"Eh? No, it's okay, I'll go myself."
"No, it's fine. I also have some shopping to do, so I'll go there on the way."
Saying that, Shiona returns to her room.
Why is that?
I feel like Shiona is trying to keep me away from the library.
No, that's not it.
It would probably be more accurate to say Tipi.
I don't know what that means, but it seems like she really doesn't want us to meet.
Shiona says it gently, but I can feel her feelings.
But, why in the world?
"I'm ready, Rei. What kind of book should I borrow?"
"You probably wouldn't understand even if I told you, so I'll go with you."
"No, it's okay. Rei, just relax."
"Then... I'd like you to borrow a book with electronic circuits in it."
"Electronic circuits, got it. Well then, I'm off."
Shiona went out.
Waiting for a few minutes.
It's probably about time Shiona is out of sight.
I reached for the door leading outside.
...That's strange.
It's not locked.
But the door wouldn't open no matter what.
It's as if it's bolted from the outside.
--Could it be, is that what's happening?
When Shiona left, she locked the door with a lock that can only be used from the outside, without me noticing.
That's why I can't get out of this door.
--But, why?
--For what purpose?
I returned to the living room, holding my head.
When I glanced at the table, a piece of paper had been placed there before I knew it.
It's a note from Shiona.
To Rei,
I think you were surprised that it was locked.
Do you remember me telling you that a nearby town was attacked?
So, I'm locking the door as a precaution.
Please stay home, okay?
I've prepared soup and bread for your meal.
Please heat it up and eat it.
Make sure you never go outside.
I've heard stories about humans who repeat looting, even from that deceased young man.
Perhaps those Ningen are coming near here.
If that's the case, it's dangerous to go outside.
I see. Shiona was worried about me.
But, if that's the case, then it's dangerous for Shiona to go outside too.
Shouldn't I, as a man, have been the one to go shopping?
--Don't try to deceive yourself....
It's certainly true that there are Ningen who loot.
Even so, is it necessary to lock the door from the outside?
Rather, if it's locked from the outside, then the key to open it is also on the outside.
Entry into the house becomes easier.
--That's strange.
If she was really wary of Ningen who loot, she wouldn't have sung in the plaza yesterday.
She wouldn't do something that would intentionally gather people.
If that's the case, then why?
--There's only one thing I can think of.
She locked me in.
To keep me away from Tippi.
There's no way Shiona would do something like this without thinking.
There must be a reason.
And it must be something she's doing for me.
......Could something have happened to Tippi?
Is she trying to keep that from me?
Something that's not good for me... so I won't be sad knowing about it...
I couldn't sit still.
I want to see Tippi. I want to confirm it.
A blue girl, alone in the library, continuing to cry.
I wanted to wipe away that girl's tears.
I look around inside the church.
There was a window in a very high position.
Even if I could climb up, there's no guarantee I could get out and down safely.
But that's the only way to get out of here.
Suddenly, a white cloth caught my eye.
A curtain swaying in the wind.
There were several of them in the room, long, large, and sturdy to cover the large windows.
I start removing the curtains from all the windows.
From the sky closed off by dark clouds, there is no sign of sunlight pouring in.
When I tied the five curtains together on the table, they became quite long.
It's long enough to reach down to the first floor.
I tie the end of the curtain to the window lattice.
I wrapped it around many times and checked the strength repeatedly.
It's okay.
It should be able to support my weight alone.
I tie the other end of the curtain to myself.
And with determination, I leaned my body out of the window.
The ground visible from there looks very far away.
I feel a little faint, but I can't back out now.
Gripping the curtain tightly, I slowly lower my body.
Halfway down, a strong wind shook me.
As my body swung like a pendulum, I did my best to cling to the curtain.
I waited several minutes for the wind to die down.
I took one big, deep breath and resumed lowering my body.
It probably took about ten minutes for my feet to finally reach the ground.
My body was so exhausted that I almost collapsed on the spot.
But I don't have time to rest here.
I started walking towards the library where the blue girl is waiting.
As if to obstruct my feelings, rain quietly begins to fall.
As if to moisten the parched town, its intensity gradually increases.
Not having an umbrella, I continue walking without minding getting wet.
The wet clothes stuck to my bare skin, making me feel uncomfortable.
I sheltered my right hand, covered with a glove, as if protecting it from the rain.
Puddles started to form under my feet, and distant thunder began to rumble.
My rough breaths occasionally carried rainwater into my mouth.
In contrast to my hot body, the cold rain beat down from outside.
Spitting out the rusty-tasting rain, I finally arrived.
At the library where the blue girl was waiting alone.
The inside is dimly lit, and no light leaks out at all.
Is that child buried alone again in that dark sea of books?
Just thinking about it made my chest ache terribly.
I entered the entrance and proceeded to the depths where the blue girl is waiting.
"You came after all..."
A voice came from the back.
It wasn't Tipi's.
It was the very person who was keeping me away from here--.
"I wrote in the note that it's dangerous outside and you shouldn't go out, didn't I? Or maybe you didn't see it?"
"No, I saw it."
"I see... So you knew and came anyway. Rei is a bad boy."
Fufu, I hear Shiona's laughter.
But I can't see her expression well in the dimly lit hall.
"Why did you lock me up?"
"Locked you up...? Well, I guess that's how it turned out. I'm sorry."
"You must have a reason, right? Would you mind telling me if you're okay with it?"
"...A reason? The reason is simple. I don't want you to see her."
"You don't want me to see her...?"
"The blue girl who's up ahead."
"Tipi? Why?"
"I can't tell you that. It's top secret."
"Wait, I don't understand what you're saying. Why can't I see Tipi?"
"That's... because it's not allowed."
"That's not a reason! Tell me properly."
"I can't tell you the reason."
I couldn't help but raise my voice.
At the same time, I realized that my chest was burning red and hot.
Is this "anger?"
Am I feeling anger towards Shiona...?
I don't mean to. I just want her to tell me the truth.
But my words just now seemed to have upset Shiona.
I can't see her expression clearly in the dark, but the atmosphere coming from her has changed.
An air of hesitation, as if she's struggling to say something.
Shiona opened her mouth slightly, as if to say something... but then closed it again.
And tilting her chin down as if to look down, she whispered the words.
"...Because it will bring unhappiness."
"Unhappiness? To whom?"
"...To Rei, to me... and to everyone living in this town, I guess."
"The people in town? Because we meet? I don't understand what you're saying."
"Certainly, you may not understand now. But you'll surely regret it later."
"Why would I regret it? Hey, Shiona, tell me clearly. I'm not very smart, so I don't understand unless you tell me clearly..."
"In other words, it's like this..."
The sound of boots.
Shiona is approaching me in the dimly lit entrance.
The next thing I felt was warmth.
And, softness.
Shiona was hugging me.
"Shiona... eh? W-what...?"
"Please, Rei... won't you just go home with me like this?"
"Like this...? What do you mean?"
"It's very bad for Rei and Tipi-chan to meet. To be precise, bad things will happen in a chain reaction if you meet. So..."
"Could it be that I made Tipi angry? Is that why she doesn't want to see me, or something like that?"
"No, it's the opposite. Tipi-chan loves Rei very much."
「Then--」
「That's why I can't meet her. Please, understand.」
The arms Shiona had wrapped around my waist tightened.
A sweet fragrance enveloped my entire body, making my head spin.
「...Is that Shiona's wish?」
「Yes, it is. It's my heartfelt request.」
「If I were to meet Tipi, what would Shiona think?」
「I would be very, very sad. I think I would feel blue and prickly.」
「Why? Why does Shiona feel that way?」
Shiona pulled her face away from me and looked up at me with upturned eyes...
She said as if she had made up her mind.
「Rei... because I like you.」
「L-like...?」
Those words almost made my mind shut down.
Sweet breath.
Lips that seemed like they were about to touch.
Hands around my waist.
Touching body temperature.
We were as close as we could possibly be.
And, those words just now.
Though it was just a word made of only two connected characters, it contained very deep emotions.
These words filled my chest with tremendous force.
I was feeling an unprecedented level of 'joy'.
To be needed by someone. To have a certain level of emotion poured into you by a specific someone.
I don't know any greater joy than this.
And now, I am about to obtain that joy.
I put my limp arms around Shiona's back.
Shiona accepts it.
Warmth increases deep within my chest.
"Shiona, I..."
"Yes, Rei. I understand. That's why, let's go home, to our home..."
Shiona's hand is linked with mine.
I turned on my heel and started walking towards the library exit.
"...Thank you, Rei. But you know, this is for the best. Because this is for Rei's sake."
I felt a sense of discomfort at those words of Shiona's.
Shiona called out to me with a puzzled look as I suddenly stopped walking.
"Shiona, you just said that, didn't you? 'For my sake'."
"Yes, I certainly said that."
"That's not right, Shiona."
"Not right? What's not right, Rei?"
"If you're saying it's for my sake, then this is wrong."
"It's not wrong. Doing this is for Rei's sake."
"It's wrong. Because, I'm happy when I can be of use to someone. I'm here to be of use to someone. But now, I'm trying to disappear from the person I can be of use to. That's not my joy, and it's not for my sake. Then, who is this for?"
"Shiona, I'm going to Tippy. That's not for anyone else, it's for myself. If someone becomes unhappy because of this, then it's my fault. But, even if that's what happens, I won't stop. Because that's the result I wanted."
Releasing Shiona's hand, I once again rushed through the entrance.
Shiona's voice didn't reach my back.
Shiona just stared at me silently, without saying a word, with a sad expression.
Passing through the rain-scented entrance, I moved my feet deeper into the library.
I could feel the moisture on the soles of my shoes being absorbed into the carpet with each step.
The dry library air clung to my wet skin.
I continued to feel unwell.
That might be related to what happened with Shiona, whom I just parted ways with.
The depths of my chest ached, as if I had swallowed something heavy.
Shiona's face flashed through my mind again and again.
Every time, she was wearing a sad smile.
Why did things turn out this way?
Why did I do such a thing?
A wave of regret washed over me.
But, I couldn't stop my feet.
--That child is in the depths of this.
A girl who is always alone.
A girl who is always blue.
A girl who is always shedding tears.
I couldn't bring myself to leave that girl alone.
That's why I'm walking down this hallway.
Paintings were hung on the walls of the hallway.
The paintings that Tippy draws, one each day.
In the painting drawn on brand new paper, a single girl was depicted.
I immediately knew who that girl was.
A girl drawn small and alone in the large paper.
Tears streamed down her cheek.
The recent paintings all had the same composition.
A painting of a solitary girl crying.
Looking at that painting, my chest ached terribly.
The girl had been alone all this time.
I felt like I understood that sadness.
I wanted to quickly wipe away that sadness.
I wanted to tell her that she wasn't alone.
I wanted to tell her that I was by her side.
Dragging my wet soles, I proceeded down the long hallway.
As I gazed at the paintings hung at a height Tippy could reach, I continued forward.
At that moment, I suddenly felt a sense of incongruity.
It wasn't because of the content of the paintings.
The problem was the number of paintings.
No matter how you look at it, Tippy is a young girl.
Even if that child drew a picture every day, could she really have drawn this many?
…Perhaps there were days when she drew several pictures in a day.
Even so, the number of these paintings is impossible.
Was the girl that lonely?
Did she have nothing else to do but draw pictures?
Ah, why did I leave the girl alone?
How many tears did I make her shed because of that?
The amount of tears of the girl in the paintings increased with each passing day.
It seemed to represent the deepening of the girl's sadness.
I hurried.
To the girl who must be crying alone in the depths of this place.
To heal that sadness.
And to wipe away those tears.
The girl. To hold her body in these two hands.
I walked as quickly as I could, to the deepest part of the library, until I was out of breath.
The girl wasn't there, in the place she should always be.
The bear plushie that she's always with, never letting go, wasn't there either.
All that was there was an unfinished picture and crayons.
In the unfinished picture, there was a figure of a girl crying all alone.
Where could Tippy have gone?
I searched the surrounding bookshelves, but her figure wasn't to be found.
Could she be somewhere in this library?
Or outside this library?
I don't know the truth.
I won't know until I try to find Tippy.
I started walking.
Weaving through the bookshelves, I searched for the figure of the blue-haired girl.
The library, with its vast grounds, is not suitable for searching for someone.
In addition to that, there's this darkness.
You can't find anything just by looking from the edge of the bookshelf.
I'll have to check step by step, with my own feet.
I walked between the bookshelves, from the back of the library towards the entrance.
Before I knew it, the clothes that should have been wet were starting to dry.
And then, when my hair was completely dry...
Finally, I was able to find the figure of that girl.
The girl was on a large stepladder, arranging books on the shelf.
The girl is an inhabitant of this library, and also serves as a librarian.
She's probably returning the books that the townspeople returned to their original locations.
That's a harsh thing for this little girl to do.
The thousands of bookshelves in this library are stacked to the height of the ceiling and connected.
I don't even want to think about the total number of books in the collection; it's terrifying.
The girl faces such a large number of books and manages them like this every day.
All alone, inside this library.
Thinking about that, I couldn't help but feel a tightening in the depths of my chest.
Tippy, stretching on the stepladder, returns a book bigger than her face to the shelf.
After finishing that task and taking a breather, Tippy turned her face toward me.
"...Ray! ...W-w-w-w-wah..."
Tippy, noticing my presence, loses her balance on the stepladder.
"Careful, Tippy!!"
The stepladder falls over.
Tippy's hand reaches out.
Responding to that hand, I stretched out both of my hands.
--An impact pierces through my chest to my back.
When I realized it, I was holding Tippy in my arms, falling backward onto the floor.
"Ray... you came, Ray...!!"
Tippy was nuzzling my chest over and over.
Relieved, I stroked Tippy's head.
Her soft hair welcomed my hand.
"Tippy, are you hurt anywhere? Are you injured?"
"Yeah, I'm okay. Does Ray hurt anywhere?"
"I'm fine. Thank you for your concern."
"You saved Tippy... I love you, Ray...!!"
The little girl's hands gripped my clothes tightly.
I felt a slightly wet and warm sensation on my chest.
Tippy is shedding tears.
But it looked like tears different from usual.
Surely they are tears of relief.
I must be able to lighten Tippy's heart a little by being here.
Thinking so, joy rushes through me.
"Tippy was arranging the books. I'm a good girl, right? Good girl?"
"Yes, you're a good girl. A very good girl."
"Hey, pet me. Because I'm a good girl, pet Tippy's head."
"Yeah... Tippy is a good girl, a good girl..."
I stroke her silky hair.
"Yay... Ray is petting my head. Tippy is so happy..."
"Do you always arrange the books?"
"Yeah. I'm repairing the books. Because I want lots of different people to read them."
I look up at the bookshelf.
Certainly, some of the books are quite old.
Some have worn spines, and some are discolored.
Tippy is repairing these...?
I remember wetting the books in the rain.
If I handle them roughly, I'll end up increasing Tippy's work like this.
I vowed from the bottom of my heart to treat them with care.
I sit up and lean my back against a nearby bookshelf.
"Sorry I'm late."
"It's okay... because Ray came here like this."
"Were you okay by yourself?"
"No... I was very, very lonely."
"Were you crying?"
"Yeah... yeah, yeah..."
Tippy presses her face against my chest.
Occasionally, I could hear her sobs.
"It's okay, I'll be with you from now on."
"Always? Ray, will you stay with Tippy?"
Yeah, that's right. I'll try to come to the library as much as possible.
Won't you lump me together with them?
Tippy raised her face.
Large tears were pooling in her eyes.
That's a little difficult. I'm currently being taken care of by Shiona.
But, I'll come every day. That'll be enough to not be lonely, right?
Yeah... but, the nights are very lonely.
The nights, huh...
It's dark and quiet... Sometimes, Tippy thinks she might be all alone in the world.
That's not true. That's not true...
All I could do was hug Tippy.
Tippy has a sweet scent.
A sweet scent different from Shiona's.
Yeah, I know... Tippy is happy just that you come here like this. Hey, Ray. Is it okay if I ask you something?
Yeah, what is it? Tippy
Will you help me?
Yeah... of course, it's the least I can do.
I stood up and took Tippy's hand.
Pushing a cart filled with several books, we strolled through the library.
Next... um, a book called 'The Philosophy of Mind and Body'.
"If that's the one, it's Easy 493, third shelf from the top, thirteenth book from the right."
As soon as I said the book's title, Tippy stated its location without missing a beat.
It was as if she knew every single book in this library.
In the place she mentioned, there was indeed a gap for one book.
When I inserted it, it fit perfectly.
Tippy wasn't just saying things randomly.
She was pointing out the book's location with certainty.
I became interested and decided to ask a slightly mischievous question.
"Hey Tippy, can I ask you something?"
"Do you remember the opening part of this novel?"
What I presented was a rather old-fashioned novel.
Tippy stared intently at the title, and began to recite as if opening a book in her mind.
"Below me was a drop of five stories. Cream-colored bricks were laid right next to the school building, creating a walkway that looked pleasant to stroll along. Right next to the walkway was a flower bed, and even from this height, I could see the colorful flowers. If I were to throw myself from here, would the cream color and the flowers all be stained with my dirty blood?"
Tippy recited it word for word, without a single mistake.
It matched the handwritten text in the novel perfectly.
"Could it be that you remember all the books here?"
"Hmm... I don't know."
"Then, what about this book?"
After glancing at the book I presented, Tippy fluently recited.
"The human body consists of approximately 206 bones, starting from the head with the occipital bone, frontal bone, temporal bone, parietal bone, sphenoid bone, ethmoid bone, malleus, incus, stapes, inferior nasal concha, lacrimal bone, nasal bone, vomer, maxilla, palatine bone, zygomatic bone, mandible, hyoid bone, then connecting to the cervical vertebrae, extending to the thoracic vertebrae, lumbar vertebrae, sacral vertebrae, coccygeal vertebrae, ribs, and sternum."
"...Then what about this one?"
I presented another handwritten book, this one titled "The Complete Pi Encyclopedia."
"What about the beginning of this 'Soulless Child Theory'?"
"'Everything is finite, and even the soul is no exception. A child born after the soul has been exhausted will be a soulless vessel. - Edward Morgue'"
Tippy has memorized all the books here.
But, why?
Even with tremendous memorization skills, she would first need to read all these books.
Even if she kept reading every day, she could never finish reading this sea of books.
What on earth is going on...?
"Ray, what's wrong?"
"Oh, it's nothing. Come on, let's put the next book away."
There's no point in thinking about something I can't figure out.
For now, I'll focus on helping Tippy with her work.
After returning all the books to the shelves, we sat down in our usual spot.
"Ray, thank you for helping me."
Tippy is being even more affectionate with me than usual.
Is it a reaction to not being able to see me until now?
The way she clings to me is cute and endearing.
"It's okay, Tippy. You're always doing this by yourself, right?"
"Yeah... I'm always, always alone. It's lonely."
"...Since when have you been alone?"
That might have been a forbidden question.
Tippy looked up at me sadly.
"Tippy has always been alone, for a long time."
And then, Tippy told me.
The sad story of how Tippy came to be alone.
"Papa, Mama."
It was a story from when Tippy's parents were still in the library.
The girl loved them very much.
She loved her kind mother and father very much.
Her mother was always smiling and gently hugged Tippy.
Her father was always organizing books, gently watching the two of them.
"Tippy is as spoiled as ever."
Her father takes out an electronic device for books from the desk.
"Oops, that's right. Tippy liked this one better."
He puts away the electronic device with a wry smile and takes out a "book" made of paper instead.
The technology of printing has already become obsolete and is now a precious cultural relic.
"Welcome, Tippy-chan."
She is called onto her mother's lap and sits down happily.
And on Tippy's lap is a bear plushie that her parents chose for her.
Tippy was happy every day.
She enjoyed the days she spent with her beloved mother and father.
And there wasn't a day she didn't feel happiness.
Her mother always praised the pictures Tippy drew.
"She's sure to be an artist in the future. Father, I'm so proud,"
Her father always had hope for Tippy's future.
If only those days could last forever.
I want to stay together, the three of us, just like this.
Tippy always thought so.
Before she knew it, the number of days her parents frowned increased.
Tippy didn't like that expression.
The town also seemed restless.
The adults were all talking about something, saying the same thing.
But the young Tippy didn't understand what it meant.
She just had a growing anxiety that her life as it was would be destroyed.
One day, the phone rang.
To Tippy, that sound sounded very sad.
The father who answered the phone began to frown.
That expression that Tippy didn't like.
The father, after putting down the phone, was talking to the mother about something.
After a while, the talk turned into an argument.
They were arguing about something.
The only thing I knew was that watching the two of them argue was very sad.
"Tippy-chan, will you listen to me?"
After a while, her mother looked at Tippy with a serious expression.
Behind her was her father--and packed luggage.
Tippy intuitively realized that her life as it had been would not continue.
"Right now, terrible things are happening in the world."
"Many people are scared and can't sleep at night. Tippy-chan doesn't like that, does she?"
"There are children all over the world who feel that way. Your mother wants to help them if she can."
"Yes... I knew Tippy-chan would say that... So, Tippy-chan, this is the important part. It's okay if you don't understand, but will you listen?"
"Actually, your father and I have to go far away to help those children. Even if we go, we may not be able to change the situation... But there is a possibility."
"No. Much, much farther. It's so far that it will take days or weeks to get there."
The father stopped Tippy, who was about to go to her room.
"Tippy doesn't need to pack for the trip."
"That's not it... Actually, Tippy, your father and mother are going to that place alone."
"Alone...? What about Tippy...?"
The parents look at each other.
Tippy felt something from her parents' sad faces.
Suddenly, tears began to overflow.
"I'm sorry, Tippy-chan, we can't do that."
"The place your mother and I are going is very dangerous. We don't want to take Tippy-chan to such a dangerous place. Because your mother and father love Tippy-chan very much."
"No... I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to... Tippy wants to go too..."
The parents gently hugged Tippy.
"I'm sorry, Tippy-chan... But your mother and I still have to go."
"I'm sorry, Tippy... It's okay, we'll definitely be back soon."
"We'll be back very soon... So you won't be lonely, we'll be back soon..."
"Tippy, be a good girl and stay home. And show us Tippy's paintings again."
"Oh, that's right. Draw one picture every day. What Tippy saw, heard, learned, and felt. When we get back, will you tell us about it?"
"That's right. I'll also make a lot of stories into books on my trip. I'll come back to tell them to Tippy."
"Yes, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. I promise, so..."
The three family members hugged each other.
To heal that parting, which they didn't know how long would last--.
How much time had passed since then?
Tippy continued to draw, just as her father had told her.
Each time she finished a picture, she would stick it on the wall. So that her parents would see it as soon as they came home.
What she saw...
What she heard...
What she learned...
What she felt...
But that was soon filled with thoughts of her parents.
I want them to hug me, to pat my head, to call my name, quickly... I want to see them...
Her heart was dyed blue, a deep blue.
The girl continued to draw, tears streaming down her face...
Tippy told me about her sad past, shedding blue tears of sorrow.
Her small shoulders were trembling faintly.
A girl enduring sadness right before my eyes.
I can't fathom how great her sorrow is.
Probably because I've never felt that much sadness before.
So I can't understand Tippy's feelings.
But I should be able to heal her sadness.
By holding her small body close.
Surely.
Tippy sat with her back against the wall.
I reached out to her delicate body.
When I touched her shoulder, Tippy's body jumped slightly.
It wasn't rejection.
She just seemed a little surprised by the sudden action in the darkness.
"It's okay, Tippy. It's okay."
"Hey, Ray, you won't disappear from Tippy's sight, will you?"
Yeah, I won't disappear.
You won't leave Tippy alone?
Yeah, I won't leave him alone.
You won't make Tippy lonely?
Yeah, I won't make him lonely.
You won't make Tippy sad?
Yeah, I won't make him sad.
You'll cherish Tippy?
Yeah, I'll cherish him.
You'll hug Tippy?
Yeah, I'll hug him.
You'll hold Tippy?
Yeah, I'll hold him.
You'll pat Tippy's head?
Yeah, I'll pat it.
You'll hold Tippy's hand?
Yeah, I'll hold his hand.
You'll stay with Tippy forever?
Tippy's eyes glimmered faintly in the darkness.
The shoulder I touched held a body temperature that was almost too hot.
I embraced Tippy's body--.
"Oh, you two are getting along well."
The voice that echoed in the darkness didn't belong to the girl who was just trying to heal her sadness.
It was Shiona's, who I should have parted ways with at the entrance.
Before I knew it, Shiona was standing beside me.
With a smile that was still visible even in the dim light, Shiona approached us directly.
"But you know, being too close is also a problem. You're a boy and girl of a certain age, after all."
Shiona stopped the hand I had extended towards Tippy.
"Y-Yeah..."
Tippy's face twisted in sadness, as she had been longing for that arm.
I couldn't help but raise my voice at Shiona.
"Shiona, what are you doing!"
"What's wrong? Why are you so worked up? You have to consider the implications of physical contact with someone of that age."
"That's not it. Tippy is sad... I'm just trying to heal her sadness, even if just a little."
"Sad? About what?"
"About her parents not coming home yet! Tippy has been all alone this whole time. She's been feeling lonely all along!"
"That's reality, so it can't be helped."
"Can't be helped? What does that even..."
Shiona walked up to Tippy.
And then, she looked at Tippy, who was small and grieving.
"Tippy-chan? It's sad, but Tippy-chan, you're going to be all alone, you know? From now on, forever."
She said that with a smile, in her usual tone.
"Shiona, what are you saying..."
"Tippy-chan, you understand too, right? Your mom and dad aren't coming back anymore, right?"
"Shiona... stop... stop saying such cruel things..."
"You've already realized it, haven't you? You just don't want to admit it."
"...no... no... no..."
"Tippy-chan's mom and dad..."
"...Shiona... stop..."
"Are already dead──"
"Stop it, aaaaaaaah!!"
My voice echoed through the library.
My whole body was burning up.
My breathing became ragged, and I felt a pain deep inside my head.
My clenched teeth were also grinding and groaning.
My vision flickered, and I could barely stand.
And at the same time, I was certain.
My chest felt red and prickly. The feeling that Mad always had.
This is the emotion called 'anger'.
I'm feeling anger at the injustice happening before my eyes.
Now, the blue girl's hope has been severed.
With Shiona's heartless words, Tippy was hurt.
Tippy is crying with a voiceless voice.
Her face is all crumpled up.
Turning her sadness into large drops, letting them flow down her cheeks.
With her small body, she is desperately narrating her bottomless sorrow.
Shiona added insult to injury.
"Because that's how it is, right? How long do you think it's been since your mom and dad came back, Tippy-chan?"
"Tippy-chan, you draw pictures every day, right? How many is it now?"
"Stop it..."
"Doesn't it make you sad to draw them every day? How many more pictures do you have to draw before your mom and dad come back?"
"Sto-op it..."
"It's useless no matter how much you cry. Tears only flow to comfort yourself. Just because they flow doesn't mean anything will change."
"...Please stop..."
"That's just self-satisfaction. You're just crying because you know someone will be nice to you if you cry. That's just running away from reality."
"...Sto-op...please..."
"Let's realize it already. Mom and Dad aren't coming back. Never again. Tippy-chan, you'll never be able to see your mom and dad again."
"Also, let me tell you. Rei is only here because he feels sorry for you, Tippy-chan. He doesn't have the love that your mom and dad poured into you. Only pity is binding Rei here. Do you understand, Tippy-chan? You're going to be all alone."
"Stop it――――――"
A roar that echoed.
When that voice echoing off the walls stopped, only Tippy's sobbing remained.
Tippy looks up at Shiona with hollow eyes.
I felt like the light she possessed just a little while ago had disappeared.
"Rei, spoiling and comforting are different."
"That's not true... that's not true..."
"Rei, you need to accept reality too. Tippy's parents are no longer in this world."
"That's wrong... that's not true..."
"Then why haven't they contacted her even once? Not even a single letter to Tippy-chan, who they doted on and loved so much?"
"That's... surely, they're just too busy to find the time to contact her..."
"If they knew the other person was worried, they wouldn't begrudge that time. Even more so if it were their beloved child. The fact that they haven't means—"
"Stop it... please stop..."
"—Tippy-chan's mom and dad are already dead."
I froze.
Shiona's tone was as gentle as usual, and her smile was the same as always.
I wish she would have said it in a cold, emotionless voice instead.
In that abnormal atmosphere, I couldn't continue speaking any further.
Shiona, facing Tippy again, is smiling.
"Tippy-chan, your family is just your mom and dad. But those two aren't coming back anymore. That's why no matter who you're with, you'll never be truly fulfilled. Even if Rei is with you, you can't become a family. That's an unchangeable fact now. You'll always be alone."
Shiona turned on her heel and headed towards the entrance.
On the way, she glanced back at me just once.
She just kept her gaze fixed on the floor.
"Rei... it's all for your sake."
Shiona left the library, leaving only those words behind.
Silence filled the library.
Now, even Tippy's sobs were gone.
I was furious and exhausted by Shiona's words and actions.
I couldn't even stand up.
But I couldn't leave the girl alone like this.
The girl must be thinking.
That she's all alone in the world.
That she has to live in solitude.
I didn't want her to think that way.
I wanted her to know she wasn't alone.
My feelings for Tippy aren't pity.
It's definitely not pity.
I repeated it over and over.
As if telling myself, over and over again.
I reached out and put my hand on Tippy's shoulder.
I pulled her delicate shoulders close.
Tippy initially flinched as if surprised, but then settled against my chest.
She pressed her face against me, crying silently.
I stroked her trembling shoulders over and over.
If only I could ease even a little of the sorrow she carries in that small body...
I don't know how long we stayed like that.
We sat there, leaning against each other.
After a while, when I lost all sense of time.
Tippy got up unsteadily and started walking as if searching for something.
Tippy didn't answer.
It's a sketchbook and crayons.
Tippy came back to me with the two items.
She sat down, leaning her back against my stomach.
Tippy still didn't answer.
Instead, she flipped through the pages of the sketchbook.
With a fresh page as canvas, Tippy picked up a crayon.
And without hesitation, she ran the crayon across the paper.
What she drew was a cute, age-appropriate picture.
The first thing she drew was a picture of a blue girl.
There were traces of tears on her cheeks.
Her eyes were tinged with red.
I gently stroked Tippy's head.
Lowering her gaze again, Tippy runs the crayon across the paper.
Next, it seems she's drawing me.
My hand is placed on the girl's head.
It seems to be a scene of me gently stroking her head.
And then—
It was Shiona.
She's watching the girl from a short distance away with a scary face.
That was Shiona as Tippy sees her.
Even from my perspective, Shiona in front of Tippy probably looks like that in the picture.
Why did Shiona do such a thing?
Shiona said it.
That it was all for my sake.
I don't know what that means.
No, I didn't want to understand.
I don't understand what it means to make Tippy cry and say it's for my sake.
Can I be happy by making someone else unhappy?
No, there's no way that could happen.
It shouldn't happen.
As if to erase Shiona's words that clung to my ears, I hug Tippy tightly.
Her voice was faint and seemed to disappear.
But deep down, I felt a slight hint of joy.
I think as I look at the picture.
Could this be Tippy's way of avoiding sadness?
It is said that people dream at the end of the day.
It is said that this is to organize the memories of the events of that day.
For Tippy, maybe this picture is that.
The events of that day—
Including the good and the bad, she draws everything in the picture.
By doing so, she organizes her memories and calms her heart, doesn't she?
In fact, Tippy's expression has softened somewhat.
As the picture progresses, her sadness eases.
As if she were passing her sadness onto the picture.
Tippy stood up and took my hand.
As I followed where her hand led, I arrived at a wall covered with pictures.
She said she draws one picture a day.
The number of pictures was enormous.
Tippy pasted the picture she drew today at the very end.
Another picture of Tippy's has been added.
The wall full of pictures felt like a diary showing this girl's loneliness.
Tippy must have spent her time alone entirely on this story.
All alone, bearing such a sad story....
Thinking that, something welled up from the depths of my heart.
Looking at those sorrowful eyes, I unintentionally choked up.
Instead of answering, I embraced Tippy.
After a while, I heard quiet breathing.
I compared Tippy sleeping in my arms with the picture diary on the wall.
Could this picture book be Tippy's heart itself?
Thinking about such things, I fell asleep.
It's the church where I live.
I'm standing in front of the familiar white, large door.
I pushed open that door with both hands.
The chapel that continues inside is enveloped in an astonishing silence.
--No, it's not complete silence.
Because the sound of quiet sobbing reached my ears.
I rushed through the chapel.
Then, I came face to face with the person who was sobbing.
It was a person who never stopped smiling.
It was Siona.
Siona was crying, her delicate shoulders trembling.
I couldn't hide my surprise at that.
--Why am I crying?
I didn't know the reason.
But, the fact is that Shiona is crying in front of me.
Those tears are not a lie.
Even so, I couldn't do anything.
...No, that's not true.
There must be something that I can do.
I reach out my hand.
My fingertip was reaching towards Shiona's eyes.
I don't think I can stop those tears.
But, I can wipe away the tears that have flowed.
That's all I can do, but--.
I reach out my fingertip towards the large drop.
On the way, my hand stopped.
My fingertip is made of machine.
The extended index finger has a metallic luster...
That's right.
I had forgotten.
No, I wanted to forget.
I am not a human.
I am a created being.
Why is this?
Am I not even allowed to wipe away the tears of someone I care about?
Siona is crying.
She continues to shed tears.
Is this a sadness that Siona has never shown before?
But, I can't stop or wipe away those endlessly flowing tears.
Then why am I here?
Being here, what can I do for Siona?
I couldn't find the answer.
I couldn't move my outstretched mechanical hand any further...
--Immediately after, a dissonant sound of metal scraping against each other echoed around.
The ear-splitting sound echoed intermittently.
And then, my outstretched fingertip--
The parts crumbled and fell to the floor.
The collapse, which began at the fingertip, increased its range to the palm--wrist--arm--shoulder.
Parts all over my body are collapsing and falling off.
Eventually, it became difficult for me to even stand there, and I fell to the floor.
My legs, my torso, are turning into scrap.
Scrap metal is piling up around me.
I couldn't even make a sound, and had no choice but to accept the collapse.
Siona is still crying.
Crying, stifling her voice.
I can no longer even extend my mechanical hand.
Because there's no longer even an arm or fingertip there.
The collapse corrodes my entire body, reaching even my head.
I don't feel any pain.
I shouldn't feel any.
But...
I felt a pain deep in my chest that should no longer exist.
The last thing I saw as my vision crumbled away was Siona's sad expression and tears.
Eventually, I became just a pile of metal--.
A mountain of scrap.
--And then, I woke up.
I was shouting something, but I don't remember.
My breathing is ragged.
I hurriedly look around.
A dimly lit, dusty space.
The sticky, lukewarm air clings to me.
And then, thick books lined up on the shelves.
This was the library.
I must have fallen asleep yesterday and apparently greeted the morning as is.
I hurriedly take off my gloves and check my right hand.
The hand that should have crumbled away just now was still there, unchanged.
But, just like in the dream, it's made of machine parts.
On my lap, Tippy was somehow already fast asleep.
Her innocent sleeping face doesn't betray any of yesterday's sadness.
It seems I was experiencing what humans call a dream.
During sleep mode, past records can be glimpsed as the memory area is reorganized.
But what I saw just now was probably something like a prediction derived from experience and memory.
Does that mean this kind of possibility is hidden in the future... that's what was calculated?
Even so, how sad.
I still couldn't calm the unrest deep in my chest.
Why do Siona's tears shake me up this much?
And why am I so powerless?
I am not real.
I knew that.
I thought I knew it.
But even so, I want to make them smile.
I want to make Siona, Tippy, and everyone in town smile.
But, I can't do that.
I have an idea of the answer, but I don't want to admit it.
--It's because I'm a manufactured being.
The one truth I can't resist, no matter what.
But even so, I still wished.
I want to make everyone around me smile.
But, I can't make it happen.
When I try to make Tippy smile, Siona doesn't smile.
When I try to make Siona smile, I can't wipe away Tippy's tears.
How difficult this is.
Isn't there a better way to make everyone smile?
While looking at Tippy's sad sleeping face, I repeated it over and over in my heart.
I stroke Tippy's head with my fingertip.
Her smooth hair lets my fingertip pass through to the ends without tangling.
A sweet scent spreads.
"Unn... unnn..."
Is she having a dream? Tippy let out a small voice.
Looking at her innocent sleeping face, my desire to protect her grows stronger.
But, how?
While looking back and forth between my mechanical right hand and Tippy's face, I was at a loss.
I always thought that this kind of gentle time could continue forever.
--But, that wasn't the case.
A strange sound echoed from afar.
It sounded like footsteps, as if many people were walking at the exact same time.
And, faintly, the sound of screams and something being destroyed.
Those two sounds crushed even my small wish.
I hurriedly put on gloves on my right hand.
W-What... Rei, what is it...?
Tippy woke up to the abnormality.
An anxious expression that wasn't there before spread across Tippy's face.
I don't know... but it seems like something happened.
Something? What something?
I have no idea. But I'm sure it's not a good situation.
I stood up and pointed my toes towards the library aisle.
...Rei? Where are you going?
I'm just going to check things out.
No... don't go, Rei.
It's okay, I'm not going anywhere. I'm just going to check things out on the roof for a little while.
No... I don't want you to go...
Tippy hugged me and shed tears.
You must be superimposing my parents' faces onto me.
It's okay. It's okay, Tippy.
No... no...
Have I ever broken a promise with you, Tippy?
That's, that's right. When you said you'd go see me, you always did, right?
So it's okay. I'll look from the roof and come right back.
...Okay. But, come back quickly, okay?
Yeah, of course.
After making a promise with Tippy, I headed to the library roof.
I climbed the long spiral staircase and arrived in front of an old, rusted door.
There's no sign it's been used for a long time.
When I opened it, a grating, unpleasant sound echoed in my ears.
Without minding, I pushed the door open.
...At the same time as that.
An anomaly jumped into my eyes.
Black smoke was rising from all over town.
The scream-like sounds were not a mishearing; they were coming from the mouths of townspeople fleeing from something.
And chasing those townspeople were multiple figures clad in soiled cloaks.
They quietly walked while holding firearms--yet, with efficient coordination, they were surely cornering the fleeing people.
It was as if everything was calculated, such a movement.
The townspeople cornered against the wall and the attackers are exchanging some words.
The attackers exchange glances and nod to each other, then point the muzzle of their guns at the townspeople's heads.
And, without showing a shred of hesitation, they pull the finger they had on the trigger.
──With a dry sound, their heads shook violently as if exploding, and the townspeople collapsed on the spot...
The sound snapped me back to my senses, and I understood the situation.
It's hard to believe, but... this town seems to be under attack.
What Shiona was saying was true...
I rushed back to the lobby in a panic.
Seeing me like that, Tippy asked anxiously.
"Ray... what's wrong? You have a really scared look on your face."
"...I don't really know... but... something bad is happening..."
Unable to tell Tippy directly what I had seen, I spoke vaguely.
"Something bad? What do you mean?"
"I think... this town is being attacked."
"No... Tippy's scared..."
"It's okay, it's far away from town. It should still be safe here, so calm down."
"...Okay... but, what are we going to do?"
"I'm going to go and see what's happening."
I was worried about the town, but I was even more worried about Shiona.
Even though that happened yesterday, she's still a person who helped me.
I haven't even asked why Shiona, who is kind to everyone, is so harsh only to Tippy.
I still don't understand the meaning of her words that she said it was for my sake.
"No, don't go... please... Ray..."
"It's okay, Tippy. I'll definitely come back."
"Really? Really, really?"
"Yeah, of course. So, can you wait for me a little bit?"
"If you come back, Tippy will wait."
Tippy hugged her bear tightly.
Even so, the anxiety cannot be erased from her expression.
Is there nothing I can do for this girl's sadness and anxiety?
Leaving such a guilty feeling in my heart, I left the library.
I decided to use back streets as much as possible on the way to town.
What's happening in town is clearly not good.
There is a risk that I might suffer some damage if I am found.
I try to kill my footsteps as much as possible as I head to the plaza.
I wanted to arrive before the squad if possible, but it seemed impossible because I kept taking detours.
The closer I got to the center of town, the more broken buildings I noticed.
But those were all buildings that didn't seem like they were going to break until yesterday.
Were they destroyed by those strangers who were chasing the townspeople?
Dust is drifting in the town that was beautiful until yesterday.
Why is it necessary to destroy the buildings in this peaceful town?
I just can't understand it.
Amidst the screams and the noise of buildings being destroyed, I arrived at the truth.
--The tragedy unfolding in the plaza.
Many men were chasing and capturing the townspeople.
They pointed guns and used unreasonable violence as a shield, driving away men, women, and even children.
The captured townspeople are being made to sit in the center of the plaza.
Children crying. Inarticulate shouts of anger.
The armed men, not caring about those voices, have cool faces.
No, the expression 'cool faces' might be strange.
They had faces that showed no interest, like a glance at a stone lying on the roadside.
I can't see Shiona anywhere in sight. Is it safe to assume she hasn't been captured yet...?
"--What's the situation?"
"--We've captured the majority of the residents. It's only a matter of time for the rest."
Nearby, I overheard two men talking.
So as not to be noticed, I slowly approached the two of them and eavesdropped.
"How are the water and food supplies?"
"They were sufficiently stocked. As for water, an underground water source was found."
"I see, so it's turned out to be a bigger harvest than expected."
"Yes, it's possible to settle here permanently."
I was certain.
These men are the humans who attacked the town and stole water and food.
I just couldn't forgive their irrationality.
To hurt innocent people for the sake of mere plunder.
But I couldn't do anything more than that.
I couldn't even jump out of that place.
I knew better than anyone that I was powerless.
"But how did you find such a small town?"
"--There was a slave who escaped the other day, right?"
"If I remember correctly, he was advocating for coexistence with the Phloids..."
"Yes. A foolish guy trapped in old-fashioned ideas. Coexistence and harmony with the Phloids are such useless thoughts in this world."
--Coexistence and harmony...
That word brings to mind a young man.
The man I helped, brought to this town... and those were his last words before he passed away.
Does that mean these humans were the ones who inflicted those injuries on him?
"So, we treated him the same as the Phloids, as a labor force we kept alive."
"That's right. When we chased after him to bring him back, he unexpectedly came in handy."
One of the men continues in a monotonous voice.
"After all, a human appeared to help that man and guided us to the town."
Hearing those words, I felt a chill run down my spine.
Why didn't I think about the cause of that young man's injuries back then?
I should have known from Siona that there was a group carrying out looting...
Even when returning to town, if I had paid more attention to my surroundings, I might have avoided being followed.
I regret taking such rash actions on a momentary impulse.
I am the one who created the cause of this attack──…….
"We have finished gathering the town's main people in one place. There are zero rebels."
"I see. Then, select from among them those who are oral ingestion types and have no production or management abilities. Factors that reduce productivity are──"
As he said that, the man receiving the report pulled out a pistol from his pocket.
"Dispose of them."
"--Stop!"
At the same moment I understood the meaning of those words, I shouted.
However, I couldn't help but shout at these humans who so casually said 'dispose' of the townspeople who had taken care of me.
With that, the men who were there turned around.
And our eyes met.
"Secure him."
With that voice, the men rushed towards me.
In a hurry, I started running.
But my body couldn't keep up with my feelings.
My feet didn't turn well, and I ended up running away while losing my balance.
Immediately, the men were closing in behind me.
Their movements are mechanically precise.
Damn it, at this rate, I'll be caught.
As a last resort, I fled into an alleyway.
The alleyway had many muddy spots due to the rain.
While my feet were being caught, I kept running.
Occasionally, I knocked over lumber propped against the wall, trying to slow the men down.
But that wasn't enough to stop them.
I knew the men were closing in right behind me.
Can I escape like this...?
What I was aiming for was the library.
Even if I managed to escape to the library, Tippy's existence would be revealed to them.
If Tippy were attacked──.
I changed the direction of my toes.
I fled into what seemed to be a back door of the nearest building.
Coincidentally, it was Mad's general store.
I searched for a place to hide──.
"! ?"
I found a figure sitting in a chair.
Mad didn't answer. Just like that day after turning the projector, he sat shallowly in the chair with his arms crossed.
"Mad, you can hear me, right!? Stop joking around at a time like this, Mad──Mad?"
I swallowed a scream just in time.
The moment I touched Mad's shoulder, Mad──quietly collapsed from the chair. As if he were already dead.
Wh-Why--!
Did those men 'dispose' of him? But, there are no visible injuries.
"Target acquired."
What brought me back to my senses as I was about to panic was, ironically, the voices of the men who had been chasing me.
But it was far too late.
"We have enough manpower as it is, eliminate him."
Unable to do anything, I just hurriedly jumped back from Mad, the men stepped in, and the lead man aimed his gun at me──
"Rei!"
Immediately after, several things happened simultaneously.
A gunshot rang out with a dry sound.
And a figure slid in front of me as if to protect me──.
"Shio──"
It took me a moment to grasp the situation.
That person was standing there, as if to protect me.
That person turned only their face to look at me.
With the same unchanging smile, that person looked at me.
And, a few seconds later──.
"Shionaaaaaa!"
With a completely blank mind, I scream.
Seeing that figure, my body started moving unconsciously.
With the mechanical arm hidden under my glove, I punched down one of the shelves, causing a chain reaction that toppled all the shelves in the store──scattering fine fragments and even finer dust everywhere.
At the same time, I picked up a can that had fallen on the floor and threw it with all my might towards the window.
The men reacted to the sound of the window glass breaking.
"Did they escape through the window?"
"Chase them!"
The men jumped out through the still-open door.
"They're gone--"
As for me, I was crouching still right next to the fallen shelf, half of my body sunk into the floor that had been knocked out by the impact.
While holding Shiona in my arms so that the shelves and fragments wouldn't hit her.
"Shiona, Shiona, hang in there!"
I desperately shake Shiona, whose eyes are closed.
It seems she's fainted.
I run my eyes over Shiona's body, but I can't find any injuries.
Could the bullet have missed? But, since she's unconscious, I can't say she's unharmed.
In any case, I have to evacuate once.
──Near here, a place where I can do that is…
I take a deep breath and remember.
The girl I left waiting at the library.
I took the back streets, trying not to be seen by the humans, and returned to the library.
Carrying Shiona on my back was a considerable handicap, but I went through the destroyed buildings, threading my way through them again and again.
During that time, Shiona didn't move at all. That helped when carrying her, but at the same time, my anxiety increased.
If something happened to Shiona... While being crushed by that fear, I arrived at the library.
The clouds covering the sky had darkened even further.
Having finally reached the library, I began searching for Tippy.
Is Tippy safe?
So far, there are no signs of the library having been ransacked.
There's no sign that anyone has entered.
Passing through the entrance, the interior of the library was silent.
Feeling relieved, I weaved through the shelves, searching for Tippy.
But no matter how much I searched, I couldn't find Tippy.
Could it be--
Trying to shake off the unpleasant thought, I desperately searched the area.
Could it be--
Relying on hope, I headed to the lobby.
I went around to the back.
There, I found Tippy, covering her ears and eyes, trembling slightly.
I reached out my hand to that small body.
"Tippy, I'm back."
Tippy's shoulders were jumping slightly.
But when she recognized me, she hugged me with the force of a jump.
"Welcome back. I believed in you, Rei."
She pressed large tears against my chest.
Her body was trembling slightly.
Ah, I had made this child anxious again.
I put my hand on her back and stroked it.
"It's okay... I'll never leave you again."
Perhaps relieved by those words, Tippy's trembling lessened and eventually stopped.
"What happened? Shiona, what's wrong?"
Tippy looked at Shiona, who still had her eyes closed, and asked anxiously.
I told her the truth without hiding anything.
"She was shot. To protect me... She doesn't seem to be injured, but she lost consciousness..."
"Show me quickly!"
With unprecedented agility, Tippy picked up Shiona and laid her down on the floor.
"Rei, turn around, I'm going to look at Shiona's wound."
"Ah, okay... wait, is Shiona injured?!"
"I don't know. But I'm going to check."
Seeing Tippy reaching for Shiona's clothes, I hurriedly turned around.
Shortly after--
"……it's okay, there were no problems……Rei."
Tippy's tone had returned to normal.
I quietly turned around.
Shiona was breathing peacefully on the lobby floor where she was lying.
I thought she had been shot protecting me, but it seems she just lost consciousness from the close-range gunshot.
"That's good……"
I sighed with heartfelt relief.
"Rei, why was Shiona shot?"
"Humans came. And they're starting to loot this town. Destroying buildings--"
I didn't mention that the townspeople were about to be 'disposed of,' or that Mad-san might have already been 'taken care of.'
"And when I was found and about to be shot, Shiona protected me--"
I clenched my fist tightly without thinking. Tippy looked at me sadly,
"--I see. But if that's the case... this place might be dangerous too."
She answered with a serious face.
"If we hide, can't we get through this somehow... until the humans leave..."
As if to stop my words, Tippy sadly shook her head.
"The humans have found this town. A town where they can live. So, they'll come here too."
"No way... are those guys going to settle down here...?"
"Because this is a 'town.'"
A town... that's right.
I walked through barren lands before reaching this place.
There was no food or water, and I was constantly facing death.
Those humans must have traveled through such a world, too.
If that's the case, this "town" is a paradise they couldn't have wished for.
"But... even so, why do they do things like stealing? The people of this town would have accepted them."
"It's for them to live."
"It's wrong to think that anything is okay if it's for that... that it's okay to sacrifice someone!"
"...Rei, scary..."
"Ah, sorry, I didn't mean to scare Tippy..."
I released the fist I had clenched in anger and stroked Tippy's head to reassure her.
Let's think about Tippy and Shiona for now.
If we stay in town like this, these two will be in danger, too.
I really want to help everyone in town. But, I can't right now. I don't have the power or wisdom.
I'll freeze the emotions that Shiona and the townspeople taught me for now, and mechanically... make the most efficient choice.
Let's go somewhere we can settle down for a while.
"Tippy, let's leave town for now. And let's think about how to help the people in town."
As I said that, my chest tightened.
It's because I put a rank on lives.
I chose the lives in front of me, within reach.
That's probably a shameful thing. The weight of life is equal, but... even so, I'm trying to choose...
"Yeah, I think that's a good idea."
The little girl's nod lightens my sense of guilt.
"Let's hide in that abandoned factory for now. There shouldn't be anything there that humans would want."
"Then, I have to prepare food for Rei and Shiona..."
"That's right. I wish we could somehow stop by the church."
The library and the church where we are now are on opposite sides of the plaza, at opposite ends of town.
Even if we leave town and make a big detour, we'll be sitting ducks if they snipe at us in a place with no cover. On top of that, I'll be carrying Shiona on my back.
So, does that mean we have to go through the rubble again? It'll be even more difficult this time since Tippy's with us...
I explained that to Tippy as clearly as possible.
"Is it hard to go to the church?"
"Yeah... for now."
"Then, you should go under!"
"...Under?"
"Yeah, under. Go under the ground to the church."
"Yeah, underground. If it's underground, no one will find you."
"Underground... underground, huh... but how?"
"You can go inside through a manhole and go under the town."
...I see.
Certainly, if we do that, we can get to the church without being seen by anyone.
"That's a great idea, Tippy! You're amazing, Tippy!"
"Ehehe... Rei praised me."
"But, where are the manholes located in town?"
"Hmm... Rei, come here."
Tippy takes my hand and leads me to the bookshelf.
Without the slightest hesitation, she came to a certain bookshelf.
"That book."
I take the book Tippy is pointing at and open it.
Inside was a map of the town's manhole locations and its underground waterways.
"That's amazing, Tippy! With this, we can get to the church without any problems."
"Thank you... Rei."
I stroke her head, and Tippy narrows her eyes in delight.
"Alright, Tippy. Let's get going right away."
"Yeah... but wait. I'll get ready, so just a little bit—wait?"
"Yeah, sure."
"Thank you, Rei."
Tippy bows quickly and disappears into the back room.
Tippy said she was okay, but I'm still worried that she hasn't regained consciousness.
Maybe what the humans shot wasn't a bullet-firing gun, but a weapon that takes away freedom of movement.
If I know the cause, I can figure out how to deal with it.
Is an unknown situation really this terrifying?
"Rei, sorry to keep you waiting. --What's wrong?"
Tippy came back from the back room.
"No, it's nothing. I was just a little worried about Shiona."
I answered, trying to appear as calm as possible.
"So, what are you taking with you?"
Tippy, who said she had prepared, was carrying a large bag.
"A stuffed animal and... a picture book and... crayons."
"I see. They're important to you, aren't they?"
"And... pictures of Papa and Mama."
Tippy said sadly.
Pictures of her parents, who will probably never come back.
I don't know how Tippy feels as she stares at those pictures.
"Um, well, what's this then?"
Apart from the large bag, Tippy was carrying a thin but sturdy metal bag in her hand. It seemed a little too rugged for little Tippy to carry.
"This is... I'll tell you about it later. More importantly, Rei, let's go."
"Ah, okay..."
With Tippy's help, I carry Shiona, who is lying on the floor, on my back. Strangely, I couldn't feel her weight.
"I'm ready, Tippy."
"Okay, then... goodbye."
Tippy bid farewell to the countless bookshelves.
Her voice sounded somewhat sad.
I still haven't been able to heal this girl's sadness at all.
But I haven't given up.
We'll be together from now on.
Even if it's just little by little, as we spend that time together.
I want to heal Tippy's sadness.
And someday, I want to see Tippy with a genuine smile on her face.
That was my secret wish right now.
"Alright, let's go."
"--Yeah."
Even so, Tippy followed me without uttering a single weak complaint.
By the time we reached the church, we were quite exhausted.
There was no sign of humans around.
We carefully looked around and stepped into the church.
The chapel was completely silent.
It was a silence that made the town's commotion seem like a lie.
I found a music box on the altar at the back of the chapel.
Was this where Shiona listened to that melody?
The sound of my footsteps towards the music box echoed loudly in the chapel.
I approached the altar and reached for the music box.
As I turned the handle, a melody poured out from inside.
The melody somehow warmed the depths of my heart.
--Suddenly, I heard a singing voice.
It came from behind me.
"Welcome back,"
Shiona said, and got off my back.
"That's not important. Are you hurt anywhere? Tippy said you were okay, but..."
"Yeah, I seem to be fine."
Shiona smiled as if to reassure me. Then, she looked at Tippy, who was next to her.
"Tippy-chan... you came too, huh?"
"Yeah--"
Tippy nodded, looking as sad as ever--yet with a look of resolve.
"Shiona..."
Tippy held out her palm towards Shiona, stopping her words.
"I understand... I understand, but!"
Shiona looked down, as if enduring something.
"--Shiona."
In response, Tippy was gentle as ever...
Those were such unexpected words. Shiona gasped and stared into Tippy's small eyes.
"While I was with Rei, I realized... what Shiona is trying to do."
"But, if that's the case--"
"That's also why I came here. The library is impossible now... Probably this town, too."
"Tippy-chan, I'm sorry..."
"It's okay. Shiona doesn't have to cry, okay?"
Tippy gently embraced Shiona, who knelt down and jumped into Tippy's chest, as she said that.
It was as if Tippy was the older sister, creating such an illusion.
"Rei, what are you going to do now?"
Tippy's words startled me back to reality.
"If Shiona seems okay, I want to help the people of the town. Especially those who are said to be disposed of--"
"Shobun?"
"Yeah..."
It was a terrible way of putting it... Speaking as if they didn't see fellow humans as humans.
"Can Rei do it?"
"I don't know, but... even so, I can't just stand by and watch someone about to be killed right in front of me."
"But, Rei will be in danger."
"Yeah, I know that, but..."
They're the kind of guys who would point a gun at you without a second thought. There's nothing I can do by confronting them head-on.
I'm sure even having a discussion would be impossible.
"I promise. If it gets even a little dangerous, I'll definitely turn back."
"Absolutely. If Rei gets hurt--everything will be irreversible."
Yeah. I can't leave Shiona behind, either.
Rei...
Shiona--
With that one word, we separated as if magnets repelled each other.
I-I'm sorry! It's not like I forgot about Tippy-chan!
Only Shiona... that's not fair...
Tippy pouted slightly, saying such a thing.
I'm sorry, Tippy. I didn't mean it that way...
I apologized as well, gently stroking Tippy's head.
Muu... That's not it at all...
Even so, Tippy's expression wasn't entirely displeased.
Shiona laughed at that sight first--followed by me, and then Tippy also smiled.
And so, we laughed together.
Without anyone saying it, the three of us held hands.
Grasping each other's hands tightly, as if never to let go again.
And before that resolve could waver, I declared.
From now on, let's always be together, the three of us. Always--
But, as if mocking me...
In the distance, footsteps echoed.
Shiona's smile, Tippy's smile, stiffened.
I'm probably stiffening up, too.
Everyone in town has been captured.
Then, the one heading towards this church now is--
Without a doubt, it's a HUMAN.
I was the first to move. I looked outside the window, making sure not to make any noise.
There's one figure. However, I don't know how many will come in the rear.
"Shiona, Tippy, go to the back of the chapel. Crouch down as much as possible so you can't be seen from the outside."
"Okay, but shouldn't we lock the door first?"
"That's no good. If we do that, they'll definitely call for backup. If that happens, we won't stand a chance."
I want to neutralize the HUMAN outside without making any noise if possible.
If it's just one person, I think I can manage. If it's two, we can somehow manage with a surprise attack.
But, if it's three or more--I haven't told Shiona or Tippy, but I was prepared to get captured myself.
I muffled my footsteps and stood in the shadow of the door. In the meantime, the footsteps are getting closer and closer.
The number is one. For now, there's no one following behind.
......Hoo......
I quietly took a deep breath and steeled myself.
I held my breath. The footsteps are--right nearby.
The door slowly opened.
Following that, a man with a pistol slowly entered.
--Now!
In that instant, I swung my arm down with all my might from his blind spot.
Immediately, I kicked away the pistol that fell to the floor.
At the same time, I tried to sweep his legs, but as expected, he dodged it.
We're still at a distance where we're almost touching.
It's probably safe to assume he has weapons other than a gun.
If so, I can catch him off guard by pouncing on him the moment he reaches for it.
But the man quietly tilted his head and looked at me.
「貴様、どういうつもりだ？」
He asked in a voice without inflection.
「何故、我々に敵対する。この町の所有者は貴様なのか？」
Owner? I just want to do what's best for the people of this town.
That's quite the Philoid-like thing to say.
...So what...that's my reason for existence.
As I said that, I took off the glove on my right hand and showed him my mechanical hand.
It's not a good idea to fight me head-on when I have a mechanical body.
If I can make him think that, maybe he'll back off.
Right now, all I need to do is ensure the safety of Shiona and Tippy. Even if my true identity is revealed to them, I will protect what I want to protect.
That is my role as a Philoid.
The man tilted his head again at my actions.
What are you talking about? Philoids cannot engage in any combat actions. They are made to obey orders so that they cannot defy humans.
Huh?
In any case, you are a misfit trapped in old-fashioned ideas. We will eliminate you before you become a source of trouble.
The blade is thrust straight at my throat.
I grabbed the blade of the knife with my mechanical right hand. Then, I put all my strength into it and twisted it sharply.
With just that, the knife blade snapped off from the base.
I put all my weight on him and pushed him down. I put the elbow of my left arm against his throat and pinned both his legs with my knees--
Ray!
Shiona burst out from the back of the room.
I pressed down on the man's throat with my left hand, and said, while raising my bare metal right hand.
It's a metal arm that can break a knife. If I swing it down on his head with all my might, he won't be unscathed.
Ray, stop!
Shiona pleaded in a trembling voice.
--But.
Biting my molars, I put all my strength into it--and swung my right hand down.
My right hand was half-buried.
Not in the man's head, but in the floor right next to it.
Why spare me? Considering your own safety, killing me is the right choice.
The man said that, still expressionless.
That's not true. Killing is the wrong choice, no matter the reason.
Incorrigible. Such inefficient thinking.
"I'll take you hostage. And make them release the people of the town."
I grab the other man's collar and pull him up.
"That's meaningless. My life isn't worth that much. If my death now opens the future for my comrades, there's no reason to regret it."
Without changing his tone at all, the man took something out of his pocket.
It was an old-fashioned bomb. He pulled out the safety pin and grabbed my arm at the same time.
"What!"
I instantly pull my arm back, but it doesn't budge.
I shudder.
Why doesn't this human show any emotion on his face, even in this moment when he's about to throw away his life?
I felt as if my body was bound by the color of his eyes, which seemed to lack any will.
--No good! If I let my thinking stop, it's over!
I instantly switched gears and started analyzing the situation.
What the man has is a really small bomb, about the size of a small fruit.
But, since it's a bomb, it probably has lethal power, and more than anything, the blast could alert the Ningen staying in the town.
When, when will it explode?
The other party intends to self-destruct. It is certain that there is not much time.
But, what should I do? If the scale of the explosion is large, Shiona and the others hiding will also be affected.
It's impossible to neutralize this bomb, so what's the best way to minimize its effect?
I reflexively hug the man. In a way that sandwiches the bomb.
This way, I might at least be able to protect Shiona and the others from the blast. It may be imperfect, but it's the best choice I can think of.
If only the two of us could make it through──
The next moment, the impact came.
From the side. Like being shoved away... no, wait, I was shoved away!
While rolling on the floor, I look at the place where I was.
There, Shiona was, holding the bomb.
「Shiona!」
「Get down!」
The bomb she was holding burst with a strong light and sound.
Perhaps the scale of the explosion wasn't that large because it was a type of bomb not intended to kill.
Even so, I, who was at close range, was directly hit by the blast and sound and felt dizzy.
The human who was also at close range has also lost consciousness.
「Shiona!」
In my swaying vision, I shouted.
Please, please be safe.
「Shiona!?」
「…Rei……」
「Shio…na……」
「Shiona, we need to treat you immediately!」
The distance of a few steps felt incredibly long.
While slapping my wobbly legs, I approached Shiona.
And then, I saw it.
What... is this...
Looking at Shiona, I was speechless.
Her right arm, thrown onto the floor... from the wrist onward... a metallic... frame?
Not bone. Absolutely not. It's clearly different from that of a human.
And--it's not there.
That's strange.
Something that should be there, wasn't.
Red.
That is the proof of a human.
Wh-wh-why?
B-but...
I clench my mechanical right hand covered by a glove.
Yes, if we were the same... if only we were the same....
Shiona, are you... okay?
Yeah, I'm fine with just this much.
There's no way that's true.
There's no way that could be true.
She took the explosion at such a close range.
There's no way she could be okay.
It must be so painful, so painful that she can't help but shed tears.
And yet.
And yet, why?
"Rather than me... Rei, your head."
I followed Shiona's gaze and touched my head.
--Ah, why is this?
Why is it that something Shiona needs is with me?
I don't need this.
I don't need this, so I wished Shiona had it instead.
No, she should have had it.
Shiona touched my head and said.
"You're bleeding, are you okay?"
Blood was flowing from my head.
Red.
Red blood.
Something that doesn't flow in a Phiroyd...
In contrast, not even a drop of blood flowed from Shiona's arm.
Instead, the exposed mechanical parts were visible.
What this means is only one thing.
That is--
"...Rei? There was a loud noise, are you okay--Shiona!? Rei!?"
Tipi, who came out from the back, screamed.
Her expression was anxious, and her eyes were filled with large tears.
"Both of you, you have to heal your injuries...!"
"It's okay... I'm okay..."
I gently embraced Tipi, who was on the verge of panicking, as if to envelop her.
Embraced, Tipi's face showed a slight expression of relief in my chest.
But it was unstable.
It looked like it was about to collapse at any moment, and it made the depths of my chest ache.
"Rei... let's move, we can't stay here anymore..."
Tipi said in a trembling voice. Shiona nodded in agreement.
Certainly, with the explosion just now, other humans will definitely come.
There were many things I wanted to ask.
There were many things I wanted to confirm.
But, I swallow it all for now.
"...Let's go, let's leave the town."
We left the church with only the bare minimum of luggage.
Then, following Tipi's instructions, we used the back streets of the town to escape to the outside, and headed for the abandoned factory.
I was reminded of that again...
The only one whose steps were heavy with fatigue... was me.
Led by Tipi and pulled by Shiona, I continue walking.
Reaching the abandoned factory, I finally lowered myself to the ground.
Next to Shiona, who has a cool face, I regulate my rough breathing.
"Tipi, I'll go get some water."
The little girl glanced at Shiona and then disappeared into the depths of the abandoned factory.
She probably entrusted all the explanations to Shiona.
"...Shiona"
Shiona returns a slightly troubled smile to my voice.
"I think you've already noticed, but I am... well. Everyone living in this town is a Philoid."
That was... what I was trying to look away from.
I had a premonition... I also felt something was off... but it was something I didn't want to admit...
"So... I'm a 'human'?"
When my head was damaged, a red liquid leaked from the damaged area.
It closely resembled the 'blood' that flows inside a human body.
Philoids don't have such liquid installed, so it shouldn't flow.
"You've been misunderstanding because you have a mechanical arm... that's an artificial medical part to compensate for limbs lost in an accident or something."
"No way... then I really am..."
"Yes, you are a human. The parent and partner who created us Philoids. That's you. Everyone in town is a Philoid. Only you were human."
"I see..."
I stare at my mechanical right hand covered in a glove and weakly clench it.
The existence I thought I had was the complete opposite....
Shiona is a Philoid... and I am a human....
In other words, I am a human, the very being I should hate.
I felt something deep inside my chest.
That feeling was painful.
Sad.
And infuriating.
I was the same as those cold-hearted, merciless beings I could only see as evil.
My chest ached unbearably.
I felt anger at the unchangeable truth.
What the man I was dealing with earlier was right.
I wasn't a Philoid, but a human.
And those humans, the rulers, are trying to do terrible things to the people of the Philoid town, the ruled--no, they probably already are.
How did things end up like this?
I just wanted to live with Shiona and the people of the town.
I just wanted to make everyone happy.
But, but, but--
I can't do that.
Because I'm a human.
Because I'm one of those hopeless creatures.
I felt warmth in my fist, which I had unconsciously clenched.
When I lowered my gaze, I saw Shiona's hand placed over mine.
That warmth is artificial.
But, that didn't matter to me.
...It's warm.
Just that alone makes the emotions weighing on my heart fade.
But at the same time, it highlights my own inadequacy.
Do I even deserve to have her kindness directed towards me?
"Do you want to know more? About you all?"
Shiona said to me with a smile.
"By 'you all,' do you mean Ningen?"
"Yes, Ningen. Do you want to know about our partners?"
If I can know, I want to know.
So I nodded.
"I want to know... I want to know why we ended up like this."
"Ray, do you remember the picture of Tippy-chan in the library?"
"Ah, I remember..."
"That picture, Tippy-chan draws it every day. Every single day, no matter what, one picture a day."
I closed my eyelids and recalled that scene.
There were dozens, hundreds of those pictures drawn with crayons.
"How many do you think there are?"
"I don't know... If Tippy is also a Philoid, she's probably been drawing them for years... Maybe around a thousand?"
"Eighty-six thousand six hundred and seventy-one."
"Eighty-six thou--"
Once again, a strong dizziness attacked me. But it wasn't from the earlier explosion, or the subsequent bleeding.
For such a long time, Tippy had been spending it all alone, in that dark library?
There couldn't have been many people who came to that library.
It must have been a lonely existence.
Just thinking about the time Tippy spent there, I felt a terror as if I was losing my footing.
And Tippy endured it.
With that small body.
"From there, several decades before, we Philoids were born. Desired by humans--"
Shiona told me the history of the Philoids as if singing a song.
First, Philoids were androids that had reached the practical stage, equipped with human emotions.
Basic emotional information was installed from the beginning, and a system was adopted that allowed them to learn new emotions through independent thinking circuits.
Including that, it can be said that they are as close to humans as possible.
Therefore, they were able to become beings as close as possible to humans, not only in work but also in life.
Eventually, companies appeared that installed custom-made emotions and memories, and an unprecedented Philoid boom arrived.
Families who could not have children purchased child Philoids, and those who had lost parents or children ordered Philoids with those memories, ushering in such an era.
The number of Philoids increased in the blink of an eye, and in just over a decade, the number produced was comparable to the human population.
Among them, the most revolutionary was the Philoid equipped with 'love,' the most complex emotion of *ningens*.
It had the ability to serve as a companion for life.
It became possible to obtain a loved one without going through the process of romance, and that love was guaranteed semi-permanently.
In a society where late marriage was progressing and more *ningens* were prioritizing work over romance, the demand was great and it was received with acclaim.
However, children were not born into families who married Philoids, which accelerated the declining birthrate.
And the declining birthrate created a shortage of marriage partners, creating a loop in which more and more Philoid marriages increased.
"And, before they knew it, *ningens* forgot how to nurture love."
Shiona smiled sadly.
"*Ningen* children began to be created artificially using science. But *ningens* who had lost love could not teach love to the children who were born."
Love was the origin of all emotions.
Because there is love, you feel the joy of connecting with someone.
Because there is love, you know what you want to protect and feel anger when it is hurt.
Because there is love, you feel sadness when you lose something important.
Because there is love... you share, divide, and know the joy of sharing the same emotions.
But──......, they forgot it.
The *ningens* who came to town are those kinds of "*ningens*."
*Ningens* who have forgotten "emotion" along with love have even lost the heart to care for others.
*Ningens* no longer needed love, and the existence of Philoids with emotions became unpleasant.
When considering the efficiency of actions, there was too much waste... or so they thought.
*Ningens* eventually came to believe that Philoids should be machines.
To deliberately harsh environments... to tasks involving danger... to abuse exceeding specification limits...
But there were also humans who did not approve of that.
Humans who retained the emotion of love appealed, saying that Philoids were partners.
The world was divided in two.
Humans with love, and humans without.
And the humans without concluded.
That the ideas of the old generation were foolish and should be annihilated...
They didn't even hesitate to press the button for a weapon that would scorch the earth.
After that, everything was fast.
It didn't even take five days for retaliation to call for retaliation, and for the world to be enveloped in flames and ash.
A polluted and poisonous earth, black clouds blocking the sunlight, a sea unable to nourish life.
The history of humans would come to an end by their own hands...
It was such a foolish choice.
"We, who were born for the sake of humans, ended up taking away what was most important to them."
"That's not true... we humans are to blame for everything..."
"But you know, there were many humans who survived. No matter how tattered the world becomes, life never stops moving forward."
I can't find the words to respond to Shiona, who speaks to me so gently.
"...Ahem, ah, ahh, ah--"
Suddenly, Shiona began vocal exercises.
And then, she turned to face my questioning gaze head-on──
Nice to meet you. I am MODA-117 Alice mk-17, manufactured by Asou International. Have you completed user registration? If you have registered, please decide on my individual name. It's the first name given to me. Please choose carefully!
I was caught off guard.
It would be easy to dismiss it as something I'd never seen before... but it was the first time I'd seen Shiona so utterly cheerful and innocent.
"Were you surprised?"
Shiona asked, returning to her usual self.
"Y-yeah..."
"That's the oldest memory I have."
I wonder when that was. I can't even imagine.
"Back then, every day was like a festival... it was so lively."
So saying, Shiona showed me a piece of paper that looked like a newspaper clipping.
"World-renowned Musician Passes Away"
The photo on it was the same one that was in the photo frame in Shiona's room.
He had a face similar to mine.
"This is... your brother?"
"Yes, this story is also from a long time ago... You see, I'm the latest model among the Philoids that were manufactured. Fifth generation, I think."
I wonder how Shiona feels about describing herself as 'manufactured'.
Philoids have emotions just like humans.
In other words, they are the same as humans.
Can she really accept it so easily?
"My generation was the first model to be equipped with the concept of human 'death.' It was to get as close to humans as possible. But the models before me don't have that... that's the case with Mad-san and Tippy-chan. Neither of them can understand 'death.' It's useless to explain it. The day they understand will never come."
To continue waiting without knowing death.
It's a hope that exists, but a hope that will never be rewarded.
Despair in the name of hope.
To be confronted with that unconditionally.
If I'm going to be confronted with something like that, wouldn't it be better if you just taught me despair from the start?
I felt that would be better for me.
"Tippy-chan is an earlier model... I think she was a second-generation Philoid. Up to the second generation, they couldn't extract energy from food. That's why she runs on electricity. But there's a limit to how long the battery lasts. She carries that bear plushie as an auxiliary battery for that."
Come to think of it, Tippy always had that plushie in her hand whenever she moved somewhere.
I had no idea it was a battery.
But that explained something.
The reason Tippy was always in that library.
That library has the only power generation system in town.
Tippy stayed in that place to continue functioning.
"Tippy-chan's parents also died a long time ago. Probably more than 200 years ago. But Tippy-chan, who has no concept of death, is waiting. Always and forever, all alone."
What a cruel story.
I don't know the lifespan of a Philoid, but Tippy has spent hundreds of years like that.
Shedding tears every single day.
Trapped by a future that will never come... imprisoned by unfulfilled hope.
In that library, all alone.
It feels like there's a lead ball in the depths of my chest.
It's painful and agonizing.
But the more I think about it, the more it sinks into the depths of me.
"But, even knowing that, it's still painful."
And Shiona is aware of death. In other words, she can't even hold onto the hope that she might see them again.
"Ray, you saw Mad-san collapse at the general store, right?"
"Yeah... it was strange. It was like his soul just left him, even though he had no external injuries--"
I understand now. Mad-san was already broken at that time.
"But, we have to keep living like this. Until the day we die--until we break. For us who don't get sick, that's a time equal to eternity. That's why we try to be human. Wouldn't it be too sad otherwise? We take over the work our partners did, or fill in for positions that have disappeared... we keep the world turning, just like humans did. So that this world that humans kept turning never stops."
Mad-san ran the general store.
There were photo studios, bars, and all sorts of shops in town.
That was all thanks to the work of the Philoids.
It was the Philoids' effort to protect the world of humans.
It was the last hope of the Philoids who were left behind.
"We spend every day so that when humans return someday, we can tell them about that fun world, so we can return it to them."
Shiona showed a smile.
An emotion that definitely doesn't fit the current situation.
With that smile, Shiona was protecting herself.
That smile looked sad to me.
"But... we Philoids also have a defect. That is, if something unbearably painful happens, only some kind of emotion comes to the forefront. I'm like this, Mad-san is always angry, and Tippy-chan is always sad."
But,
That's our last fortress. If even that emotion disappears, we'll break... we'll die.
Then, when Shiona was shot, Mad was--
That's right. He didn't just go on a trip. After Ray finished showing him that movie, Mad stop--no, he stopped moving.
So, you closed the store--Shiona?
Yeah. I thought if I didn't, Ray would start to wonder, even if the townspeople didn't. And you did, right?
Well, yeah, but...
If the store had stayed open there, I definitely would have gone inside and found Mad not moving.
If the humans hadn't come, I probably never would have noticed.
In the end, it was confirmed that I wasn't just seeing things.
I didn't want to believe it, but it was the truth.
My brother used to say, 'Emotions are pieces of the puzzle of life.' The pieces of emotion connect life. If emotion is missing, all the pieces will collapse. That's the same for humans and Philoids. Mad broke because the emotion of anger towards his son dissipated.
If that's the case, then I killed Mad.
I went and found the playback device on my own, and I showed Mad his son's movie without permission.
If I hadn't done that, Mad would still be moving now without breaking.
Sensing my feelings, Shiona moved to my left side and put her hand over mine.
It's okay, it's not your fault, Ray. Sooner or later, we're all destined to end up like that. It's the same as humans not being able to escape death. Mad was probably happy. He was able to know his son's true feelings in the end.
Maybe. But--
An unbearable feeling swells up.
If I had known that back then--I would have stopped him, even by force.
You're so kind, Ray--
That's not true...
Shiona stood next to me.
I couldn't see Shiona's expression.
Anxiety pounded against my chest from the inside.
Because even knowing, I still wish for it. I wish that someday, I'll be able to see that smile again.
Shiona smiled sadly as she looked down at her brother's picture.
That's why, when I first met Ray, I was so happy. Ah, so it was a dream after all, I thought. My brother was alive, I thought.
Dying.
Whether you know about it or not, it's painful either way.
Made to be convenient for humans, forced to have a family, and then left with only the pain of death.
Selfish and awful.
That's us, humans.
Tipi is feeling the loneliness of losing her family. That's why, if we act like family, she'll 'die'. But that doesn't mean I don't want you to say those things to Ray. We Philoids have a rule that we can't do or say anything that 'makes them realize we're Philoids.' Because it would shatter the humans' dreams. But I went too far... I'm sorry.
When Shiona lowered her head, a sweet scent wafted around.
Certainly, what Shiona did wasn't something that could be forgiven.
But, considering Shiona's feelings, it was clear that that method was the most reasonable.
It can't be helped. Shiona was just following the rules, it's not her fault.
Forgiving someone like this, and someone being forgiven.
Apologizing, and being apologized to.
Crying, getting angry, laughing.
That's what humans are.
They, the Philoids, knew that better than anyone.
"Thank you for telling me, Shiona. For being so kind to me, a human--"
I felt ashamed as a human.
To think that I'm repaying the kindness of these Philoids, who are doing so much, with evil.
Even as we're standing here, humans might be 'disposing' of Philoids in the town.
And the Philoids probably can't offer much resistance to that.
Thinking that, I couldn't hide the pain in the depths of my heart.
Shiona gently reached out and embraced me.
A warm warmth enveloped me.
"Of course. Humans and Philoids are partners, both in the past and now. It's decided that it will be that way far into the future too."
I felt like the emotion I couldn't understand until the very end was there.
It was warm, vast, deep, strong, gentle, soft, large, and precious.
Humans had lost something significant.
But, they remembered the part that humans had forgotten.
For many years, many decades, many centuries.
While enduring loneliness, they continued to protect it.
I felt like I had to inherit that and protect it in the same way.
It wasn't a duty or an order.
It was something I myself desired.
I'm back, I found some clean water.
As I was sharing body heat with Shiona, Tippy called out to me from behind.
For some reason, I felt embarrassed and instinctively distanced myself from Shiona.
The warmth that had been touching my skin was snatched away by the air.
But that gap was immediately filled with a new warmth.
I looked and saw Tippy had slipped in between Shiona and me.
"Tippy too... hug me."
Shiona and I exchanged glances.
Shiona seemed to be entrusting the decision to me.
Tippy has lived in solitude for two hundred years.
If things continue as they are, Tippy will be able to live semi-permanently without breaking.
But, is that happiness?
Does an empty life have any value?
I embraced Shiona.
Including Tippy, who was standing between us.
Shiona, in the same way, embraced me.
Tippy hugged both of us and muttered softly.
"Warm..."
It was warmth for the first time in two hundred years.
Tippy had been waiting for something so trivial for two hundred years.
That was a very sad time....
If I could give Tippy two hundred years' worth of warmth, I would definitely want to give it to Tippy.
Because then, I feel like I could say that the time Tippy waited wasn't wasted.
"What are you going to do now, Rei?"
Shiona asked me while still hugging Tippy from behind.
"If I could... I still want to help everyone in town... but I don't think I can right now."
I feel bad for the people in town, but I don't have the power to do so.
First, I want to ensure the safety of Shiona and Tippy.
It's a little far, but let's go to the factory where I woke up.
No, that place probably wasn't a factory.
A facility where people who could no longer live in the world due to war continued to sleep until the polluted land became even a little better.
My... awakening was a little late.
There was still electricity there. Shiona and I can ingest food orally, so if we have the food we brought from town, we'll be fine. But in Tippy's case, she needs to be charged.
"Shiona..."
Tippy raised her voice, probably realizing it just from those words.
"Yes, that's right... I'm sorry."
"No. I thought I had to say it soon."
Tippy continued, sounding somewhat sad, yet with a slightly stiff expression.
"Tippy too, has to do what Tippy can do... while there's still time."
"...Tippy-chan?"
Something must have caught her attention, Shiona questioned Tippy.
"The three of us, let's survive together."
Those were words without any certainty.
There was no guarantee of anything.
Even so, all I could do was continue to say those words.
"We will, the three of us, survive together forever and ever."
It was just an ideal.
I know the world isn't sweet enough to live on ideals alone.
Of course, Shiona probably knows that too.
Even so, Shiona didn't express any doubts to me.
Anxiety or dissatisfaction.
She sealed all those words away.
Surely her heart must have been filled with them.
In fact, my heart was being trampled by those feelings.
Even so, it was necessary.
Words of hope.
"......Yeah."
Shiona nodded and hugged me and Tippy even tighter.
And so, we began our journey towards the facility.
"This is... outside the town..."
Facing the wilderness, Tippy hugged her bear plushie tighter to her chest.
Is this different from the scenery Tippy knows?
Yeah. When I saw it before, there was a road, there was a forest, and then--and then--
The scenery Tippy described was like an even larger-scale version of the festival days Shiona had told me about.
It seems that in those days, humans freely controlled not only towns, but also nature, the Phylloids, and even the weather.
So... by the time I started operating, humans had already begun to decline...
Shiona seemed a little lonely. The hem of her clothes billowed greatly in the dust-filled wind.
Alright, let's go!
With a little food and a spare battery for Tippy, we started walking through the wilderness to survive.
And above all, to survive.
Struggling, struggling, to survive.
Floundering, floundering, to stay alive.
Just being alive is enough.
Just being alive had value.
I truly believed that from the bottom of my heart.
Using the position of the sun, faintly discernible through the dim clouds, as a guide, I walked while searching my memories.
As the sun set and the temperature dropped, the three of us snuggled together and fell asleep.
Sometimes singing songs, sometimes encouraging each other, sometimes joking around...
We continued on a journey that was not always just painful.
We crossed the reddish-brown earth and reached our destination three full days later, just as the sun was beginning to set.
The building is half-buried in sand... no wonder we couldn't find it. I can't believe this facility was still here...
As we entered, faint lights flickered on, and the air conditioning hummed faintly from somewhere.
The room was exactly as it had been when I woke up. First, I gathered up the Phylloid parts that would be unpleasant for Shiona and Tippy and put them away.
I'm sure these Phylloids were protecting us humans while we were in cold sleep.
「やったー、すわれるー」
Tippy ran over and was the first to sit on the sofa that was there.
As soon as she sat down, all the strength seemed to drain from her body.
It seems I was pushing her pretty hard.
「……なんだかさむいね、ここ」
It was originally a facility for cold sleep, after all.
Even though we're inside, it's a little colder than outside.
Now that the air conditioning is working, I want to believe that the function to raise the temperature inside the facility is still working.
But I don't know where it is.
I wish we had a heater or something...
We can do this. Rei, sit next to Tippy.
Like this?
Get closer!
L-like this?
When I asked that, almost pressed against Tippy, Shiona looked satisfied and said,
Yeah, this should be fine!
And then, Shiona sat on the opposite side from where I was pressed against Tippy.
Like me and Tippy, pressed close together.
See? Isn't this warmer?
Y-yeah... I guess so.
It's definitely warmer. But...
How is it, Tippy-chan? Still cold?
Mmm... warm.
Tippy narrowed her eyes and snuggled against my arm.
Warm? Good, I'm glad.
Yeah, warm... really warm, Rei. It's like...
Like what?
When we're like this, it's like we're a family.
............
Tippy's Papa and Mama used to hug Tippy like this a lot.
Yeah. It's like that time, it's warm.
...Yeah, it's warm, isn't it.
...Hey, hug me again? Squeeze Tippy tight?
I almost hugged her without thinking, but I stopped when I felt Shiona's sad gaze.
Tippy-chan, I can't do that.
Why? Won't you hug me tight?
Yes, that's right. Because Tippy, we're not family or anything.
Not family... is Tippy all alone?
Yes. No matter how long we're together, you're alone. That's something that can't be changed.
If you only picked up the words, they sound cold, as if she hates Tippy.
But I understand now.
That those words are full of kindness.
The only emotion left within Tippy.
--Sadness.
To fill Tippy's heart means releasing her from sadness...
In other words, it's the same as dying.
Until now, I had been hugging Tippy without thinking.
But perhaps that was a kindness that was far too cruel.
No, maybe it wasn't even kindness at all.
It was just a self-satisfying act that only shortened Tippy's lifespan.
Shiona had been enduring it all this time.
To protect Tippy's feelings of sadness... more than anything, to protect Tippy.
She probably really wanted to hug her.
She probably wanted to pat her head and say kind words.
She probably wanted to give her a smile that turned her heart orange.
Without reaching out to this blue girl, she had been enduring it all along.
That's why I thought I had to endure it, too.
That's what I thought, but... I couldn't stop myself.
I just couldn't bring myself to leave this girl with such a sad expression in front of me.
I embraced Tippy, and Shiona who was beyond her, together.
The depths of my eyes grew hot.
I know this is an act that shortens Tippy's lifespan, but I ask myself why I can't stop.
Aren't I just temporarily satisfying my own desires...?
I really am a human after all...
Selfish, full of self-interest, a human who hurts others.
I hugged them both tightly, painfully so.
I drew in the warmth of two people.
As if to fill the void of two hundred years, we brought our warmth closer.
The warmth of three people doesn't allow us to feel the cold, even within the freezing facilities.
It was that warm.
From Shiona's mouth, a melody naturally spilled out.
That song that Onii-san made.
That melody lights a warmth deep within my heart.
Her gentle singing voice echoed throughout the factory.
"Tippy, you know, Tippy loves this song that Shiona sings."
Tippy said, burying her face in my chest.
"It reminds me of when Papa and Mama were here... somehow, the tears just won't stop."
A girl repeating her sorrow.
Tippy has been repeating that sorrow for two hundred years.
I may not be able to wipe away those two hundred years of sorrow.
But I can give her this moment of warmth.
I decided to put those two hundred years' worth into this fleeting warmth, and embrace them both.
But that small moment didn't last long.
"Huh... Tippy?"
I turn my gaze to Tippy, who is sitting on the sofa.
There, Tippy was blankly staring ahead as if in a daze.
"What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?"
"Hmm? ...Hmm..."
She doesn't seem to be doing well.
Is it because she's been released from the tension, or because she walked for so long?
Either way, it seems like she needs to rest.
"Tippy seems tired too, so let's rest for today."
"...O-okay."
She replies a beat late. It seems she was thinking about something.
"Rei, Tippy-chan might be lacking energy. That's probably why her attention is scattered."
"I see... then we need to replenish her electricity. --But, how do we do that?"
"It's non-contact charging. The charging equipment should be common, so first we need to find a connector and store electricity in the bear plushie."
"Got it. If I find something that looks like it, I'll ask you to confirm."
"Leave it to me."
Leaving Tippy on the sofa, I start checking what's inside the facility.
Many cold sleep devices are lined up. I look for one that is still leaking cold air.
Then, I open the maintenance lid at the base and examine several cables connected to the distribution panel.
Before long, I discover something like a power connector connected to a thick cable.
"Yeah, this type should be fine. Tippy-chan, lend me the plushie."
Shiona borrows the bear plushie from Tippy, opens the zipper on its back, and exposes the connection terminal.
When she inserts the charging connector there, the bear's eyes blink twice.
That must be the signal that charging has started, Shiona sighs in relief.
Tippy also tightly grips the bear's hand. Just that seems to transmit electricity, and I feel the light in her eyes intensify.
"Shiona, let's have a meal too."
I show her the oral blocks I found when I was looking for the charging cable.
It's the same thing I found when we left this facility.
"The taste is nothing compared to Shiona's soup, but I think it does have nutrition."
"No, I'm happy because I was hungry. Just being able to have a meal makes my heart feel warm."
I line up the portable dishes and place the oral blocks on top.
I thought this would make it look a little more like a meal.
Because it's a time like this, I want to cherish the everyday, even in the little things.
I wanted to imitate, even a little, what we used to do in that town──at Shiona's house.
"It looks delicious."
Shiona smiled, as if understanding my wish.
We put our hands together before the meal.
Tippy, who was watching us, comes to our side.
Then, she puts the bear plushie in front of us and puts her hands together just like us.
"Together with everyone."
"Tippy-chan...?"
"Haha, Tippy is a very delicious feast. It's very luxurious."
Tippy looked shy and bashful.
In these past few days filled with nothing but hardship, it was a time when my heart felt at peace.
Surely in the distant past, we humans lived this kind of life with our partners called Phylloids.
No, it should be a life we can still get back even now.
Just like I, who had lost my emotions, was taught by them... I should be able to regain the time I had forgotten...
I was thinking about such things while bringing the oral block remaining on the plate to my mouth.
──It was then.
『Warning. The wear rate of the main battery exceeds 90%. Please replace and maintain the battery immediately.』
Suddenly, Tippy started saying such things in a businesslike tone.
『An online replacement request will be made to the service center――The service center is offline. Retrying.――The service center is offline. Retrying.――The service center is offline. Retrying...』
"Shiona, this is――!"
"I don't know the details, but Tippy-chan's battery can't be charged anymore."
"Can't be charged..."
Was the voltage different? No, that shouldn't be a problem since it's going through the bear plushie.
Then, is there a problem with the battery itself?
If there's a possibility... could it be deterioration over time? Come to think of it, it's a battery that's been running for over 200 years.
It wouldn't be strange if it was completely worn out.
"Maybe we need a new battery..."
"A brand new battery... Besides, Tippy-chan's generation couldn't be replaced without a specialized technician disassembling it first, I think...!"
"No way..."
Cold sweat ran down my back.
In other words, Tippy will stop functioning as is--no, will she die?
"No, after coming all this way...!"
"It's okay... because I knew it would happen."
Tippy's voice returned to its usual tone, and we could only stare as if struck by lightning.
"Tippy-chan, you knew this was going to happen, didn't you--"
"Yes... I thought it would happen since I left the library. I also noticed that the battery charging rate had been dropping for 6427 days."
Tippy answered with a weak smile.
"More importantly, Tippy has to do what Tippy can do... Rei, could you bring me the metal bag Tippy had?"
"O-Okay!"
The slim, yet somewhat rugged metal bag that Tippy had been carrying ever since she left the library. It was heavier than expected, and I carried it in front of Tippy.
Tippy casually placed one hand in the middle of the bag. Just like that, the two locks on the handle side automatically unlocked.
Inside was a single black board. Its size was about that of a slightly larger book.
However, it was much thinner, only about half the size of a short picture book.
Tippy carefully took it out with both hands and slowly turned to face me.
"Rei. Place your palm here. The non-mechanical one."
"Like this?"
As Tippy told me, I placed my non-prosthetic hand on the black board. Then--
A fluent male voice echoed from the black board.
"Current administrator, Vortex Company MSK-3737 model name 'Dorothy' individual name 'Tippy' has approved the continuation of work. Continuing registration."
"Confirmed. Please state the name to identify the registration applicant."
"Um... Rei."
"Understood. <<Rei>> has been registered as the new administrator. Please receive a verbal explanation of how to use it from the current administrator. That is all."
Having said that, the black board fell silent.
"Tippy, what was that just now..."
"All the books that were in the library, digitized. It's a backup of Tippy's memory storage."
Tippy answered in a slightly tired--yet somehow accomplished--tone.
I recall the many handwritten books that were lined up in the library.
Tippy, who remembered every single word written there without error.
So, Tippy was the one who wrote those books after all.
Even if she were to stop someday... no, predicting that she would stop, so that she could leave a record of the prehistoric civilization as books.
That place wasn't just a library. Tippy herself was the library.
"When you use it, place your hand in the middle of the board just like before. That will make the tablet--the board--light up. After that, you'll be able to call up all the data with the administrator's voice recognition function..."
"Then--"
As Tippy told me, I activated the board called a tablet. As I was told, I placed my palm on it.
『Biometrics confirmed, administrator Rei authenticated. Which data would you like to load?』
"The manual! How to repair a Phylloid... um, how to replace the battery!"
『Initiating search... There are 3,195 items and 124,751 types of information regarding Phylloid repair methods. Narrowing down the search is recommended.』
"From those, Vortex Company MSK-3737 model 'Dorothy'."
『Initiating search... Conditions matched.』
The surface of the tablet glowed brightly. And letters floated to the surface.
『User repairs are almost impossible. Please allow it to rest until personnel from the service center arrive.』
My vision went dark.
"How is it? Is it working well?"
"Yeah, it's working... but..."
"That tablet... only has about fifty years left... to work..."
That's more than enough time for me, but it probably isn't that long for a Phylloid or the library's management system.
"Is it really okay for me to use it?"
"Rather, please use it. From now on... Tippy won't be useful anymore..."
"That's not true! Tippy has always been helping me!"
When I fixed Siona's music box, when I fixed Mad's projector. All of that was possible because Tippy remembered the library's collection perfectly and taught me.
"It makes me happy to hear you say that, Rei--please use this from now on..."
Tippy, who had been sitting on the sofa, slowly lay down.
"Tippy!"
"Tippy-chan!"
I waited for two hundred years.
I can't let it end here.
Tippy's small mouth moved up and down, opening and closing.
It looks like he's saying something, but his voice is so quiet that I can't hear it.
I brought my ear close to his mouth.
"Hey, Rei... Tippy had fun."
Tippy's hand was placed on top of mine.
It's a small, soft hand.
"Rei as my father, Siona as my mother... you're both kind and a family I love very much."
No matter how coldly I treated him, no matter how much I pushed him away, I couldn't hide my true feelings.
Tippy had noticed.
How much we cherished Tippy.
From the moment we got involved, it was decided that Tippy would end up like this.
That there was nothing we could do about it.
That being alone forever was the only way for Tippy to survive.
But that's impossible, isn't it?
Tippy has emotions.
We're not perfect enough to overlook sadness.
No, that's not what you call perfect.
Because we can feel sadness, we are allowed to have emotions.
Slowly.
Like a handkerchief sinking into the water's surface, Tippy's eyes are closing.
Even though he's a Philoid we created, we can't even save him.
We create them, and then there's nothing else we can do.
Humans are truly selfish creatures.
"Hey, Siona..."
Tippy's eyelids slowly opened again. But the light has already disappeared from his eyes. He probably can't see anymore.
"I'm here... I'm here, Tippy-chan..."
Siona's voice was trembling slightly.
"I'm glad... Hey, Siona."
"Yes...?"
"Thank you for everything. You worked hard to keep Tippy from breaking, didn't you?"
"I think you realize this, but Tippy has been running for over two hundred years since he started operating... but his lifespan was originally one hundred and fifty years. So, this isn't Siona's or Rei's fault. It was meant to be..."
When Tippy left the library and came to the church, Siona apologized to Tippy, and Tippy forgave her.
That's what that meant...
"So, please. Siona, don't cry... Sing... Sing a song..."
"Yes... Yes--!"
"Tippy... I love... Siona's songs..."
Siona began to sing. She hiccuped occasionally, throwing off the tune. Even so, Siona continued to sing. To that melody--.
Tha...nk... you...
Tippy smiled--and then stopped moving.
My hand trembled.
It wasn't just that.
My whole body was trembling.
Now, on my lap, another small life has come to an end.
Some people might say it wasn't a life.
But for me, it was an irreplaceable life.
Siona quietly continues to sing.
The tune isn't off anymore. It's the same as always--but that song had a transparent resonance that reached everywhere.
It was a melody dedicated to Tippy.
Something hot flowed down my cheek.
It ran down my chin and fell onto Tippy's cheek.
Tippy isn't crying, but he looks like he's crying.
I hugged Tippy close.
That small body will never move again.
That mouth will never make a sound again.
Those hands will never draw a picture again.
That is "death."
Warmth spread through my head.
Siona was hugging me.
Suddenly, my eyes grew hot.
This is overflowing emotion. It's unbearable pain, uncontrollable sadness... and overwhelming grief.
For the first time in my life, I shed "tears."
Tears for Tippy--.
After that, our lives changed drastically.
The e-book terminal containing all the library's books that Tippy entrusted to me.
Thanks to what was once called a tablet, my knowledge increased rapidly.
How to grow crops, houses that can be made with just stone and mud, how to predict the weather, and many animals and plants that can no longer be seen.
Furthermore, a database of newspapers spanning the past 350 years until the library ceased functioning.
I'm sure if I searched, I could even find information about myself.
"Ray, are you studying again today?"
"Yeah. There are tons of things I need to remember."
"What kind of book are you reading today?"
"Survival--how to survive in any environment."
The power for the cold sleep facility wasn't that much. If that's the case, then I have to become able to manage to some extent with just a small amount of power.
I've already started securing drinking water using morning and evening dew, and the problem of securing drinking water, which was the weakest point of this facility, is improving considerably.
That's right, from here on out, we can no longer move forward by simply relying on physical strength and force like before.
From now on, what we need is knowledge. If we have knowledge, we can face many people alone, or even avoid confronting them in the first place--or even win.
It might even become possible to help the people in town.
I greedily absorbed the "power" that Tippy left behind.
While I was reading, Siona was singing next to Tippy, who had stopped moving.
Among the luggage we brought from town was Siona's older brother's music box.
Occasionally, instead of singing, she would turn the handle and play the music box's gentle melody.
It was a very peaceful and comforting time.
With my current "knowledge," it would be possible to live here with Siona forever.
That's why... I didn't notice.
That there was something wrong with Siona's body...
"Ray, dinner is ready."
Siona, as always, prepared the meal with a smile.
She dissolved the oral block in water, making it into a soup.
It closely resembled the orange, fluffy soup that Siona always made for me in town.
"Thank you, this soup makes me feel better."
"I'm happy to hear you say that. It makes my heart orange."
"But, Siona's soup, the amount is small?"
The amount of soup in the bowl is less than half of mine.
"I'm a Philoid, so if I go into save mode, this amount is enough."
"Is that so?"
Yeah. So Ray, you need to eat well. If you get hungry, you won't have any energy, right?
Ah... why couldn't I realize it?
At this time... her functions as a Philoid were already declining...
She was only operating at a level sufficient for half the amount of energy I was using.
As always, I was reading a book, and Siona was singing a song for me.
While tracing the surface of the tablet with my fingertip, I was thinking about whether there was a way to free the people of the town.
Then, suddenly, the rhythm of the pleasantly flowing song stopped.
Wondering if something was wrong, I looked up and saw Siona frozen while holding her hand over her mouth.
The music box she was holding had also stopped.
Siona...? What's wrong?
Um... no, it's nothing. Just the song...
She said that and took a deep breath.
And then she starts singing again──
...Ah? What was the pitch again...?
Sio...na...?
Ahaha... that's strange, even though it's a song I loved so much, just wait, I'll remember it soon...
Siona closed her eyes and tried to start singing again from the place where she had stopped, many times.
But the melody flowing from her mouth was completely different from what I knew.
What's wrong... I can't remember my brother's song...
Siona!? Is there anything wrong with your body!?
I was an idiot. In the end, I was only thinking about myself.
Siona was kind to me, cherished me, and I was satisfied with that, spoiled myself... I wasn't thinking about her.
Even though she was caught in an explosion that resulted in the loss of the artificial skin on her arm when we left town.
「Siona! At the time of that explosion, you were actually seriously injured, weren't you!」
Siona thought for a moment, then shook her head.
「That was okay, yeah.」
Siona—Philoids don't lie.
But, she will hide words, thinking about Ningens.
Since she said she was okay, there probably wasn't any damage from being caught in the explosion.
As she said—"that."
「……Siona. Can you show me what's wrong with you?」
「……Um.」
Urged by me, Siona hesitated only once before nodding.
I tried to look away in embarrassment at the suddenness of it, but what was there wouldn't let my gaze go.
Siona's white, firm chest.
There, a small hole was open.
「That is...」
Forgetting that it was a woman's body, I approached the wound.
This is a gunshot wound.
I immediately remember when she protected me from the Ningens at Mad's shop.
"It hit...it hit..."
"I was wondering if it was okay, but it doesn't seem like it was."
Siona stuck out her tongue and smiled, like a child caught doing something mischievous, but without showing any remorse.
I know that's a smile to keep me from feeling guilty.
Even at a time like this, she's thinking about me.
"... Kuh, search! MODA-117 Alice mk-17 Maintenance Manual!"
Reacting to my voice, the tablet glows faintly.
But Siona covered the screen with her hand. And then slowly shook her head.
Without losing her smile.
"It's my body. I know it best."
"But... there might be a way! If you had told me sooner..."
-- No, there's a reason she didn't say it.
Siona knew it, that she had a fatal injury that couldn't be fixed.
That no matter how much I struggled, it was a reality that wouldn't change.
It's something too horrible to even put into words.
The word 'death' floated in my head.
No matter how much I don't want to think about it, it just pops into my head.
"I know. I'm going to die soon. Since I'm a Philoid, should I say 'break down'?"
No, Siona.
You're not going to break down.
I'm going to die.
Ah ha ha, I guess I lost my focus a little, I can't put any strength in my body...
Just as I thought her shoulders slumped, Siona fell straight toward the floor.
Siona!
I hurriedly caught her, holding her in a position that would be as comfortable as possible.
How long has she been like this?
Why couldn't I have noticed...?
Does 'break down'... mean that I'll stop being me...? But, maybe it can be fixed...?
It's okay... Siona is Siona...
Ah ha ha... you know, right now... I'm a little scared...
Siona... Siona...!
Don't cry, Rei. Tippy-chan will laugh at you if you do.
Siona's hand reaches for my cheek.
It was my second tear that she brushed away with her fingertip.
I don't want Rei to turn blue... I always want you to be orange and fluffy...
It's sad.
An immense sadness wells up.
It multiplies infinitely in my heart, never ceasing.
As time passes, that sadness becomes more and more intense.
Why am I so sad?
That answer comes immediately.
Because you're important.
You were an important existence to me.
Even if a Philoid with the same appearance appeared before me, it wouldn't mean anything.
It's okay if the appearance is different.
As long as the inside is you.
"Rei... you know, I thought of you as family. It's partly because you resembled my older brother, but it's not just that. I thought you were important."
Family.
That is, a being that can be believed in and helped unconditionally, without any benefit.
That is 'love'.
The emotion I had wanted before I knew it.
I had realized that emotion before I knew it.
I had been given it all along... all along.
It's an emotion that's too natural in life, in walking with someone.
"What's wrong, Rei... don't make such a sad face... That's right, let's sing a song, let's go to the plaza again... everyone will be happy."
"...Siona...?"
"Something I promised everyone. Rei gave everyone a smile, made them feel happy."
Those are memories of happier times. Memories of the fun days we spent in town.
It's probably a confusion of memory areas.
But...
......That's right, let's sing. Everyone's looking forward to it.
I turned the handle of the music box that was placed on the floor.
The melody quietly begins to flow.
Siona's cheeks softened, and she closed her eyes and began to sing.
I also closed my eyes, listened to the melody, and reminisced.
It wasn't a long time, but I recalled the scenery of that town where I spent my time.
People walking down the street stopped and turned to look at us.
One by one, they gathered in the plaza.
Children, the elderly, someone's mother, her husband, the townspeople all began to smile.
As if intoxicated by Siona's singing melody.
Surely that scene was something that was taken for granted a long time ago.
Humans and Philoids alike, smiling and spending time together, supporting each other.
It's something we've forgotten... something we've lost that we took for granted...
Hey, Rei... always, always be smiling, okay?
...Yeah.
It's okay to be sad, it's okay to be angry... But... after that, smile.
Hey... if love has a shape, it must be round. Because love never hurts anyone.
Holding back tears, I smile.
Hey... if love has a temperature, it must be warm. Because love warms you as if enveloping you.
Yeah... I'm sure it is.
Because there's love, Rei won't be sad. Because love is something that protects, and it won't hurt Rei. I promise you. No matter what happens from now on, our love will protect Rei.
I had cried so much that my eyes were hurting.
My vision blurred.
But even in that, I could see Siona's smile clearly.
So don't cry. Love is always by your side. Because love is eternal. You don't have to cry, because it's eternal.
I placed my hand on Siona's hand that was on my cheek.
It was warm, but she had almost no strength left.
It was as if something was spilling out from between the gaps in her fingers.
I knew what was spilling out.
But I didn't want to admit it.
I gripped her hand tightly, wishing that it wouldn't spill out.
I can hear a song.
The warm melody that Siona always hummed.
It seeped into the gaps in my darkening heart, filling it with warmth.
I'm sorry, for leaving you alone again.
——! That's not true. That's not true!
I wanted to scratch my own head.
Now, I finally realized.
Siona wasn't afraid of breaking; she was afraid that I would be alone again.
I... I received so much, so much from Siona...!
Rei?
I hold Siona's mechanical hand with my human hand.
That's right, until I met Siona, I was an ambiguous existence, unable to become either human or Firoid.
Siona stayed by my side the whole time—and I was able to become human.
Siona is always inside me, I'm not alone anymore. Joy, sadness, anger... I received them all from you. I'll never forget it.
Ah... damn it, I have to smile here.
I have to reassure Siona, but my emotions won't allow it...
No matter how hard I try, tears spill out from the rising sadness.
So Siona, don't make such a sad face. I'll be okay. I'll definitely be okay.
I see... then, I'm glad.
Siona nodded, looking satisfied.
Huh...
Siona narrowed her eyes as if she was confused. Then, as if pushed out by her eyelids, transparent droplets began to cover her eyes.
I'm sure... that's different...
I said in a trembling voice, smiling to reassure Siona.
Now that I've become human, I understand the meaning of those tears.
Siona seemed to realize it soon too, and smiled back at me.
Tears... are something that flows even when you're happy, right?
The strength slowly drained from Siona's body.
Am I smiling? Am I?
I wonder if I can keep smiling, so Siona won't be worried.
……Again, then.
……Yeah, again, then.
Fuh, and then.
Siona closed her eyes.
In that instant, Siona probably had the most beautiful face I had ever seen.
And then, Siona never opened her eyes again.
That peaceful face looks like it's smiling.
As if she's praying for my happiness.
But there's no happiness in a world without Siona.
The life that continues for me from now on is hell itself.
Can I endure it?
...No, I have to endure it.
My chest tightens so much it hurts.
All the emotions run through my body, creaking.
Is my heart this fragile and weak?
Is losing someone important this painful?
Ugh... Aah...!!
My vision is dyed pure white, and as if to destroy that world, I raised my voice and lamented.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah...!
Siona said.
Certainly, Siona's love might be eternal.
But, I couldn't bear it.
I understand, this is emotion.
What Siona gave me.
This suffering, this sorrow.
But, it's not just that.
The warmth that barely remains in my chest, and the memories with everyone that I can proudly say were fun.
All of that too, Siona gave me.
Both of them, are mine now.
I will never let go of either.
I wonder how much time has passed.
How much time do humans need to sort out their feelings?
I... I was remembering the time I met Siona, over and over again.
The meals we ate together.
The times we woke up in the morning and exchanged greetings.
We went shopping together.
I went to the abandoned factory and made her worry.
She was so happy when the music box was fixed.
We sang in the town square, surrounded by smiles.
We made a promise....
I learned warmth.
I learned joy.
There were times I felt anger.
There were times I shed tears of sadness.
And... I received love.
──No... everything was love.
This tragedy was brought about by the foolishness of us humans, who lost that love.
Humans are hopelessly selfish.
They will repeat the same things over and over...
Even so, they will need someone.
It's an instinct. Even when I woke up here, I wanted to see humans.
It's the instinct to seek love, to want to walk alongside someone.
I can't even realize something so simple...
I look at the cold sleep devices in front of me.
I had Siona and Tipi sleeping in the few that were left, the ones that were functioning properly.
They were originally for humans, but this should help slow down the aging process a little.
I wanted to preserve their appearance, even just a little.
Standing before the two who look as if they are only sleeping, I mutter.
"Siona, Tipi... I'm going."
There's no reply.
There shouldn't be.
But, I continued.
"I'm going on a journey now. Don't worry, it's not a journey without a purpose. I'm going to find a world where humans and Filoides can coexist."
That was also the wish spoken by that human youth who was eliminated.
If there were a world where humans and Filoides could coexist, this kind of sadness wouldn't happen.
If there were a world where humans and Filoides could coexist, there would be no greater joy.
That's why I'm going to find it now.
"And, if that world doesn't exist──"
I clench my iron fist as if covering it with my bare palm.
"──No, it definitely exists. The world you tried to leave for us humans definitely exists."
Finding it will be extremely difficult.
But, I have the knowledge that Tipi gave me.
And, I have the emotions that Siona gave me.
I have a partner in this world who continues to convey "love."
So, this journey from now on isn't a journey of despair.
"I'll borrow this, okay? I'll come back to return it someday."
In my hand is Siona's older brother's music box.
I turn the handle in front of the sleeping Siona, letting the melody of peace contained within resonate.
In time with that melody, I felt like I could hear her song.
"Well then, I'm off."
A world where humans and Filoides can join hands──.
I took that first step.
"Even so, I remained hopeful and continued to reach both arms toward the light."
"Are you awake?"
"...Where... is this...?"
"You've awakened from a long sleep. Do you know your name?"
My name is...
"Manufactured by Asou International, MODA-117 Alice mk-17. An individual name has not been set."
"It seems the settings have been initialized. For now, Alice will do."
The man in front of me held out an old-fashioned wooden box.
"What's this...?"
"It was placed inside the device you were sleeping in."
I accept the box. It felt very nostalgic.
When I opened the lid, there was a dull golden disc. When I turned the handle protruding from the side of the box, a clear melody began to play.
A very beautiful melody flowing as the metal comb is gently plucked.
"It's a song that has been played since long ago."
A melody that isn't in my records.
Even so, it's very nostalgic, warm, and makes my chest feel warm.
And at the same time...
Hot tears streamed from my eyes.
"Emotional function runaway detected. Maintenance may be required."
"No, that won't be necessary. It's good to cherish those emotions. ...Only the knowledge was left behind, but it took a long time to recover the technology to utilize it. I'm sorry."
The man spoke to me gently.
I felt a nostalgic trace in his expression as well.
Not in my records──……My memories…….
"Anyway, shall we go home after completing the routine maintenance?"
"Where to?"
"To town."
The outside of the facility was dazzling.
The sky was blue and endlessly high. White clouds flowed slowly, drawing various shapes.
Warm air filled my artificial lungs. A gentle breeze softly caressed my hair.
It was a natural scene.
For some reason, I felt nostalgic for this ordinary world.
And... for some reason, I felt very sad.
We drove along the paved road.
Every scene visible from the window was beautiful.
Lush greenery thrived.
Small fish leaped on the surface of a clear stream.
In the sky, small birds chirped and flew together harmoniously.
"Alright, we're here."
Passing through the gate, we arrived at a town surrounded by white walls.
It was overflowing with many people.
Humans and Phylloids were holding hands, living their ordinary lives.
The sight made my eyes grow hot again.
"Excuse me, there is still a risk of emotional function runaway. The rhythm pattern in my chest is also not at a normal value."
"It's alright. I'm sure it's the right thing."
"Is that so? In that case, am I a defective product?"
"No, you're normal. You're closer to a human than any other Phylloid."
Those words were very pleasing to me as a Phylloid.
But I don't understand why I'm being told that.
I gazed intently at the town that I felt nostalgic for.
In a corner of the plaza, a human child and a child-shaped Phylloid were playing happily.
That's a photo shop over there. The Phylloid owner is smiling as he takes pictures of a human family.
At a general store in a separate location, humans were shopping, and the Phylloid owner was dealing with them curtly.
"Sensei, welcome back!"
A very cute little girl Phylloid came running towards me.
"Hello, I'm back. Have you been a good girl, Dorothy?"
"Yes! I drew lots of pictures while Sensei was gone. Look!"
The little girl showed me the picture she had drawn, with a beaming smile on her face.
The townspeople are in a circle, laughing.
The picture drawn with crayons is very warm, and just looking at it makes my heart feel warm.
It was a picture that made everyone who saw it feel happy.
Huh? You are...?
The girl looks up at me.
Nice to meet you. I'm Alice, nice to meet you.
Ali...ce? Hello, Alice. Dorothy isn't registered, so she's Dorothy.
Yes, me too.
An unregistered Phylloid. If I don't have a primary partner, what should I do?
Perhaps sensing my anxiety, the man next to me patted me on the shoulder.
What do you want to do?
......What can I do......?
Alice, can you sing a song?
Yes, a song. Like this.
Dorothy closes her eyes and starts to sing.
It was a little clumsy, but it was a familiar song.
It's a song that has been sung since long, long ago. There's no one in the world who doesn't know it.
The man said that and took out a music box from the car.
He opened the lid and turned the handle protruding from the side of the box.
A clear sound was released, and a gentle melody began to flow.
As if drawn to the melody, the townspeople gather around.
Everyone listens to the sound, their expressions becoming peaceful.
I know this scene.
In the memory area that should be pure white—a memory breathing faintly in its deepest part gently taps my heart.
My mouth moved naturally.
The song I should be singing for the first time was familiar to my throat, my lips... my heart.
The music box melody filling the square is very nostalgic.
"Wow, that's so beautiful. You're so good!"
"Yes, this song... is a very important song."
