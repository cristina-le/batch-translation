──The air shifted.
The pale blue light that had been enveloping me until now receded.
What I eventually saw was a grimy ceiling.
My right arm, which I extended toward that place, was slightly different from my left arm, which I also extended.
My right arm was made of exposed mechanical parts from the wrist down.
My fingers moved smoothly, but each time, a faint metallic scraping sound echoed.
Next, I slowly raised my upper body.
From that, I understood that the identity of the pale blue light that had been in my field of vision until just now was an oval-shaped lid with a gentle curve.
It seemed I had been asleep inside this capsule-like thing.
Where is this place?
Who am I?
Why am I here?
Even when I asked myself these questions, I couldn't find the answers.
Even when I tried to trace back my memories, all I had was the memory of the pale blue light.
In order to search for clues to my memories, I decided to get out of the capsule and wander around the room.
Even though I knew the act of walking, perhaps it had been a long time since I had done it, as my footing was unsteady.
I paid attention so as not to fall, and slowly moved forward.
The drifting air was lukewarm, and each time I took air into my lungs, dust clung to my throat.
Light streamed in from a hole in the ceiling, revealing dust in the air along its path.
Perhaps no one has entered this building for quite some time.
A thin layer of dust spreads across the floor.
What is this place used for, I wonder?
Countless oval capsules were scattered throughout the large room.
Most of them are open.
The insides are empty.
Even if some are closed, there's nothing inside.
It seems I'm the only one in this room.
…No, to be precise, that's not quite right.
There are people who exist, leaning against the oval objects or lying on the floor.
But, no, that's not it.
Female-Speaker: Those aren't people, to be precise.
It would be more accurate to call them humanoid objects.
Those humanoid objects had mechanical parts peeking out from under their skin.
Some had mechanical parts from the neck up.
Some had exposed mechanical arms.
Some had their lower bodies torn off, revealing mechanical parts.
And then, I remembered what those humanoid objects were.
Partners for humans, created for humans.
Equipped with not only the five senses but also emotions, they are the closest existence to humans.
I reach out my hand to a Philoid that has ceased functioning.
The hand with exposed parts, not covered by skin, was very similar to my right hand.
This is a factory.
I was made here.
…It's just that, nearing completion, the facility was likely abandoned for some reason.
I stared at my mechanical right hand before it was covered with artificial skin, and concluded the most likely possibility.
Having understood my own existence, I started walking towards the wall.
There was an old automatic door there, and right next to it, a liquid crystal panel displaying 《CLOSE》 was covered in dust.
I tried touching it with my mechanical hand.
The moment I felt something cold like electricity at my bloodless fingertips, it displayed 《OPEN》 and the door opened.
Could I get outside from here?
Could someone still be left in this facility?
I wanted to meet them.
I wanted to meet a human.
I'll go look for them, for my partner.
I pushed open the door leading outside.
In order to prove my own existence.
When I got home, I headed straight for the living room.
There, I found the broken music box.
I opened the book I borrowed from the library and studied its structure.
Just as I thought, the gears inside were chipped.
That's why no matter how much I turn the handle, the disc won't spin and no sound will come out.
…But what should I do about this gear?
Would it be possible to make one that matches the size written in the book? No, it's impossible.
With no answer in sight, I continued turning the pages of the book.
At the end of the book, there was a list of products for each manufacturer, and a list of the parts used.
As I skimmed through it, my gaze caught on something.
What I understood there was that the manufacturer that made this music box also made clocks.
If that's the case, then the precise parts might be the same as those used in clocks.
Suddenly, I remembered what I broke at Mad's shop.
Female-Speaker: That clock... if you're going to throw it away because it's unusable...
If we use the gears and other parts from the clock, we might be able to fix the music box.
Female-Speaker: "Rei, what are you doing?"
At the same time as I saw the possibility of repair, Shiona came into the living room.
Female-Speaker: "Shiona, listen. The music box might be fixed with the parts from the clock that was at Mad's shop."
Female-Speaker: "Really? Is that true?"
Shiona had an even more joyful smile than usual.
From that expression, I could understand Shiona's joy.
Female-Speaker: "But, don't push yourself too hard, okay? We can still sing even without the music box."
Shiona took the music box in her hand and began to sing.
She sang that song, the one she sang in the chapel.
That song, a little nostalgic.
That song, the kind that warms the depths of your heart.
Seeing Shiona gazing so lovingly at the music box, my resolve grows stronger.
I want to fix this music box for her.
And I want Shiona to be happy.
That feeling swells up inside me.
Female-Speaker: "Tomorrow, I'm going to Mad's shop again."
I'll try asking if he can somehow let me have the clock.
But there was only one thing that worried me.
That is, the fact that I broke that clock.
I apologized, but it's still hard to go there.
The thought of Mad yelling at me again is terrifying.
Female-Speaker: "You know, I want to make a lot of people smile with this song, Rei."
Shiona's words reached me as I hesitated.
Female-Speaker: "This song is orange... I'm sure it can turn many people's hearts orange. Because it's a song that was created with the wish for that to happen. Because that's your wish, Rei. That's why I want many people to hear this song. And I want to make many people smile. That's my wish."
Shiona said, as if talking to herself.
Those words pushed me forward.
I'll go to Mad's shop again tomorrow.
And I'll apologize again for breaking the clock.
With Shiona's singing and the music box, I strengthened my resolve.
The next day, I visited Mad's shop alone.
I can't count how many times I thought about turning back on the way.
Each time I thought that, Shiona's smile would pass through my mind.
Female-Speaker: I want to keep seeing that smile.
I want to fix the music box for that reason.
I recalled yesterday's resolve many times.
What I can do for Shiona.
I steeled my resolve and stepped into Mad's shop.
Female-Speaker: "You, what kind of face do you have coming here?"
Immediately after, Mad's voice, as low as distant thunder, rained down.
I immediately wanted to run away, but I didn't.
Female-Speaker: "I wanted to apologize more sincerely for yesterday."
Female-Speaker: "About the clock? You already apologized for that."
Female-Speaker: "Shiona was there at that time... I thought I should apologize properly, by myself."
Female-Speaker: "I don't need that. Get out of here."
Female-Speaker: "I can't do that. I'm truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday."
Female-Speaker: "No matter how much you apologize, the clock is still broken, go home."
Female-Speaker: "I'm sorry. I'm really sorry."
With my head lowered, I continued to apologize.
I wonder how much time had passed.
Eventually, Mad's voice, a little softer, reached me.
Female-Speaker: "...Raise your head."
When I did as I was told, Mad's face, looking somewhat exasperated, was there.
Female-Speaker: "Jeez... what a guy. You're persistent beyond belief."
Female-Speaker: "I'm sorry..."
Female-Speaker: "Don't apologize anymore, I'll punch you!"
She said that, but there didn't seem to be as much anger there as yesterday.
I thought I heard the sound of a small sigh.
Female-Speaker: "You're done here, right? Get out of here."
Female-Speaker: "Um... there's just one thing I wanted to ask."
Female-Speaker: "An ask? You've got some nerve asking me for something."
My legs trembled from the pressure, but Shiona's words pushed me forward.
Female-Speaker: "That clock... won't you let me have it?"
Female-Speaker: "...Say that again."
Female-Speaker: "Um... that clock from yesterday, won't you let me ha--"
Female-Speaker: "Are you kidding meeeeeeeeeee!"
From the impact, like being struck by lightning, I froze, standing perfectly still.
Female-Speaker: "You broke it yourself and now you want me to give it to you? Don't get carried away!"
It's no use... .
I can't take any more than this... .
As I tried to run away, a voice called out from behind.
Female-Speaker: "Please wait, Mad. Rei just wants to fix my brother's music box."
There stood Shiona, who should have been waiting at home.
Shiona, without being intimidated by Mad, stepped between me and her.
Female-Speaker: "My brother's music box is broken, and Rei said he'd fix it for me. He just needs the parts for that. He's truly sorry for breaking the clock yesterday too. So, won't you please forgive him?"
Shiona conveyed this to Mad with an unwavering smile.
Female-Speaker: "Hmm... Hmmm..."
Mad's face was bright red, but her expression gradually softened.
Female-Speaker: "But, that clock is gone now. I threw that kind of thing away. However..."
Mad turned her back to us, but continued to move her mouth.
Female-Speaker: "I threw it away at the abandoned factory on the outskirts of town. I don't know what happened after that."
After saying only that, Mad sat down, facing the wall.
Female-Speaker: "Thank you, Mad."
Shiona bowed without losing her smile and left the shop.
Female-Speaker: "Ah, thank you very much..."
I bowed in the same way and left the shop.
Female-Speaker: "The abandoned factory is very close to where Rei collapsed, you know."
As soon as we left the shop, Shiona told me.
Female-Speaker: "Is that the place Shiona goes to throw away trash?"
Female-Speaker: "That's right. Trash from various places gathers there."
Female-Speaker: "Could it be that you fix up things you pick up there and sell them here?"
Female-Speaker: "That's right. Mad often goes to that place."
I see, that's why there were so many old things in the shop.
She probably brings usable things from that place and reuses them.
In any case, I decided to head to that abandoned factory.
Female-Speaker: "Shiona, if you don't mind, I'd like you to guide me to that place."
Female-Speaker: "I'm sorry, the Red Children are supposed to come to my house today."
She must be talking about those children who were talking to Shiona yesterday.
Come to think of it, I promised to treat them to soup.
Female-Speaker: "But Rei, you can't go alone, right? I'll go and turn down the promise with the children."
Female-Speaker: "No, it's okay, Shiona. You should keep your promise."
Female-Speaker: "But, how are you going to get there?"
Female-Speaker: "I'll try going to the library. I also want to know about this area and look at a map."
Female-Speaker: "The library..."
Shiona's expression seemed to cloud over slightly.
Female-Speaker: "Eh... no, it's nothing... Hey, Rei. Is Tippy-chan fond of you?"
Female-Speaker: "I wonder. I don't think she hates me, but why do you ask?"
Female-Speaker: "No, it's nothing. If it's the library, I'm sure there's a map. Goodbye."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I'll do that. Well then, see you later."
I turned on my heel and tried to head to the library.
The smile Shiona showed at that time seemed to me to contain some sadness.
But, I don't know the reason for it.
Female-Speaker: "Rei, you came."
Tippy was shedding tears in the same place as yesterday, in the same way.
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I came. Hey Tippy, is it okay if I ask you something?"
Female-Speaker: "Does this library have a map of the town?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, it does. It has lots of them."
Female-Speaker: "That's good. Will you guide me to where the maps are?"
Female-Speaker: "I don't mind... but..."
Tippy was somehow hesitant.
Female-Speaker: "No, that's not it... that's not it, but..."
Female-Speaker: "Will you hold me?"
Tippy's face turned slightly red.
Her sad expression hadn't changed, but her cheeks seemed to soften just a little.
Female-Speaker: "...Hold you? Hold you, like what we did yesterday?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah... is it no good?"
Female-Speaker: "It's not no good. Here, come here."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah... yeah..."
When I opened my arms, Tippy stood up and jumped into my chest, somewhat hesitantly.
Unlike yesterday, I ended up holding her.
But, my thoughts are the same as hers.
The Tippy I held was still small, soft, and seemed like she would break.
Female-Speaker: "Tippy, is this okay with you?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, it's okay. Rei... you're warm."
Tippy rubbed her cheek against my chest.
That gesture warmed the depths of my heart.
Could this be the emotion called love?
I want to protect this girl.
I want to stop these tears.
For a while, I held Tippy close.
Female-Speaker: "Um, can you walk over there like this?"
Inside my arms, Tippy pointed her finger toward the aisle.
Still holding her, I headed in the direction she indicated.
Female-Speaker: "Why do you need a map?"
Female-Speaker: "Apparently, there's an abandoned factory near the town. I want to go there."
Female-Speaker: "Why, to the abandoned factory?"
Female-Speaker: "Because, the parts I'm looking for might be there."
Female-Speaker: "The music box you were looking at yesterday?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, that's right. I really want to fix Shiona's brother's music box."
Female-Speaker: "Shiona's... I see. I hope you find it."
Still held in my arms, Tippy led me without hesitation to the bookshelf where the map books were kept.
Female-Speaker: "Could it be that you remember where each book is located?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, mostly."
Female-Speaker: "That's amazing... Did someone teach you?"
Female-Speaker: "No. I learned by myself while waiting for my mom and dad."
When she said the words "mom and dad," Tippy's eyes became a little teary.
Female-Speaker: "Um... is this it, maybe?"
To change the subject, I took out one of the map books.
I sat down on the spot and opened the book.
Like the music box book, this map was also handwritten.
Could it be that all the books in this library are handwritten?
If that's the case, that's a considerable amount.
Who on earth would handwrite this many books?
The work would take an endless amount of time, and it makes me feel faint.
Female-Speaker: "It's quite tattered... About how old is this book?"
Female-Speaker: "Um... I don't know. It's a book from a long, long, loooong time ago."
It seemed like a map from decades ago.
The buildings themselves seem to be the same as the current townscape, though...
The pages are severely faded, as if tea had been spilled on them.
Some of them were stuck together and looked like they would tear if I turned them.
I carefully turned the page.
Female-Speaker: "Ah, could this be it?"
I found a factory map symbol to the north of the town.
Judging from the direction of Shiona's house, there's a high possibility this is the place.
Female-Speaker: "Rei... are you going? Don't go..."
Tippy clung to my neck.
I stroked her small back with my hand, over and over.
Female-Speaker: "It's okay, I'll come again."
Female-Speaker: "Really? Will you really come again for me?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, of course. I promise."
Female-Speaker: "You promise? You absolutely, absolutely will come again for me, okay?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely."
I made a promise with Tippy, over and over again.
I wonder why.
Even so, I hesitated to leave that place.
The feeling that I want to stay by Tippy's side forever is welling up inside me.
Hiding that feeling, I left the library.
Relying on the map, I entered the abandoned factory and was assaulted by the smell of oxidized oil.
This factory, too, must have originally been making Philoid arms and legs.
All around, half-finished Philoid arm and leg parts were scattered everywhere.
All of them are from before being covered with artificial skin, with the machine parts exposed.
Looking closely, I can see that they're made the same way as my right arm.
Even knowing they're artificial, this sight is bizarre.
To move a rolling arm out of the way, I push it aside with my right hand.
The mournful sound of metal clashing against metal echoed throughout the factory.
If some part of my body breaks by chance, I'll come here.
If it's here, there are mountains of parts that can be used as replacements.
In the back, there were many drums filled with oxidized oil rolling around.
Most of it has oxidized, but some of the oil is still unopened.
Even if I run out of oil, I can perform maintenance here without being seen.
The further I go into the factory, the more the worries I had in the back of my mind are resolved.
This abandoned factory should become an important place for me.
But, I can't find the most important thing.
That is, of course, the clock that Mad threw away in this place.
But, inside this factory, there isn't a single thing that looks like trash, let alone a clock.
Could it be that the trash was thrown outside, not inside the factory?
I decided to leave the factory for now and go around its perimeter.
Then, on the back side of the factory, I was able to find an area where machine parts were piled high.
There are machine parts, of course, but also a lot of trash is dumped there.
Surely this place has become the town's garbage dump.
Besides Mad, there must be others who have taken things that could be useful from here.
Looking up at the mountain that was many times my height, I thought about that.
Female-Speaker: "......Now, where could it be?"
There's a considerable amount of trash.
It would be difficult to find it by diligently searching.
But, there's no other way.
I immediately decided to start searching from my feet.
I don't know how much time has passed.
I had long since lost my sense of time.
Because I was moving muddy metal plates and containers covered in waste oil, my hands are filthy.
My clothes were covered in oil, and before I knew it, there were a lot of stains on them.
Even after that, I crossed a carpet of garbage, swam in a river of filth, and was hit by a waterfall of scrap.
And then, I finally found it.
It was in Mad's shop.
The one I broke yesterday.
Female-Speaker: That clock.
I picked it up and stared intently at the hands on the dial.
Of course, it's not moving.
I put it to my ear, but it didn't make a sound.
It's only natural since I broke it.
This clock will probably never tick again.
That fact pricked the depths of my heart slightly.
Gently, I hugged the clock and decided to start heading home.
Shiona greeted me kindly.
Female-Speaker: "I'm home. I found it."
When I held out the oil-stained trophy, Shiona smiled gently.
Female-Speaker: "Really, thank you. Here, change your clothes, change your clothes."
Shiona had prepared a towel and a change of clothes for me.
After wiping off the dirt and changing, I headed to the living room.
Shiona greeted me there as well.
Female-Speaker: "Rei, you're tired, aren't you? Eat and rest."
Female-Speaker: "No, I'm okay. I want to get to work right away."
Female-Speaker: "Are you okay? I'm worried about your body, Rei."
Female-Speaker: "I'm fine. Strangely, I don't feel tired right now."
Female-Speaker: "But, you have to eat..."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I know. I'll eat later, so you go ahead and eat first."
Female-Speaker: "...Okay, I understand. Do your best."
Shiona left the living room.
I watched her go, and then I started working.
I opened the book I had borrowed from the library beside me.
This music box has a mechanism where gears of various sizes inside intricately mesh together when the handle is turned, keeping the disc rotating at a constant speed.
Apparently, it doesn't mean the song will speed up if you turn it faster.
I thought that was a very impressive technology.
Following the assembly instructions written in the book in reverse order, I disassemble the music box.
Then, as I compare the presence or absence of parts in order, I find that a gear in the power transmission part is broken.
So, even with something that moves with precision, it will stop working if just one small part fails?
I couldn't help but look at my right hand.
For now, I'll try to find something the same size as this broken gear from the clock.
I then started disassembling the clock.
I removed the lid and used a screwdriver to remove the screws.
When I removed the cover, the internal structure was revealed.
Gears much more precise than those in the music box meshed together in multiple layers.
One of them, a slightly larger gear, had a broken shaft. That's why the parts won't turn.
I guess this is the place I broke yesterday.
The fact that Mad threw this clock away means that there wasn't anything the same size as this gear.
Fortunately, the broken gear wasn't the size needed for the music box.
Disassembling things makes me feel somewhat reluctant.
Because I'm breaking this clock in order to fix the music box.
Perhaps it's because I myself understand what kind of existence I am.
Hesitantly, but as a small offering, I carefully disassembled the clock as much as possible.
I lined up the clock gears on the table, from smallest to largest, and compared them to the ones from the music box.
Female-Speaker: "...I found it."
I was able to find a gear that seemed to be almost the same size.
Female-Speaker: Now, all that's left is to transplant this into the music box according to the book.
Female-Speaker: "I think this should work..."
With this, the disc should move without any problems.
I put the lid back on and turned the handle, and I felt a response.
But, the handle won't turn any further.
I wonder why.
I reread the book.
There are no problems with the parts or the positions they're assembled in.
Tilting my head, I removed the lid again.
And then, I tried turning the handle as it was.
Certainly, the gears meshed together perfectly.
But, it seems the oil has completely dried up because it hasn't been used for a while.
That must be the reason why the handle won't turn.
What should I do?
Should I go to Shiona and borrow some cooking oil?
...No, that's also a problem.
Cooking oil and gear lubricant are probably different types.
It might move at first, but it could cause a breakdown.
Then, what should I do...?
Suddenly, I looked at my right hand.
Although it's covered by a glove, underneath are exposed mechanical parts.
What if I used the oil used in my hand?
I took off my glove and looked closely at my right hand.
Exposed mechanical parts.
Oil is incorporated inside to smoothly move those parts.
I inserted a screwdriver into the palm near the base of my thumb.
When I removed the exterior, it was packed with mechanisms such as wiring, cylinders, and shafts to move the mechanical hand.
One of the cylinders inside contains oil.
And it was detachable so that the old oil could be easily replaced.
I removed the cylinder with my left hand and dripped the oil that filled it onto the gears of the music box.
I spread the oil with my fingertip so that it would blend into all the gears as much as possible.
I wonder if it will work?
I returned the cylinder to my right hand and reattached the exterior.
Hiding the mechanical arm with the glove, I tentatively turned the handle.
At first, it was awkward. But, as I turned the handle, the gears ran smoothly.
The oil must have circulated through all the gaps in the gears, and the handle continued to turn without any snag.
And that melody begins to play.
Female-Speaker: "Ray, that song...!"
Shiona suddenly came into the room.
Female-Speaker: "Yeah. I fixed it, Shiona."
Female-Speaker: "Thank you... thank you, Ray. Thank you... I'm so, so happy."
Shiona showed me a smile I had never seen before.
Just looking at that smile, the depths of my heart warmed gently.
And then, I realized.
Female-Speaker: Ah, so this is it.
Female-Speaker: This is the emotion called happiness.
I am happy now.
I am happy to see Shiona's smile.
And, for the first time, I was able to feel a sense of being useful.
Female-Speaker: "Thank you, Ray, thank you."
Shiona took my hand and thanked me many times.
As her face drew closer, I felt my face getting hot.
Female-Speaker: "Thanks to your hard work, Ray, the music box is fixed. I can listen to that song again, which I had given up on. This orange-colored song that my brother made. This song that I love so much..."
Female-Speaker: "Hey, Shiona, sing it. Let me hear your brother's song."
Female-Speaker: "Yes... of course!"
I turn the handle of the music box.
Shiona clasped her hands in front of her chest and began to sing along with the melody.
The song she was singing when we met.
The song Shiona's brother made.
An orange-colored song.
I feel like I understand its meaning now.
The emotion dwelling in my heart is joy.
Shiona's song.
And Shiona, singing so happily.
Just watching her like that, I was overflowing with joy.
More than usual, Shiona seemed so happy as she sang that song.
That day, Shiona kept singing until she fell asleep.
I was also absorbed in her singing voice and the tone of the music box.
Many times, Shiona asked me to play the song for her.
Shiona kept singing until my arm was about to stop moving.
Looking at her expression, I think.
I want to be with Shiona like this forever.
If Shiona wishes for it, I can be with her forever.
But for that to happen, my true identity must never be revealed.
Never, absolutely never...
That day, I solidified my resolve to stay with Shiona forever.
Night, the room darkened.
On the two beds placed side by side, Shiona speaks to me.
Female-Speaker: "Will you listen to my request?"
Female-Speaker: "You see, I want many people to hear this song. And I want to make them smile. I want to make many people happy with this song that my brother made."
I only know the word.
But, I didn't know what it was.
Is it a state?
Or is it an emotion?
I repeat the word 'happiness' over and over in my head.
Female-Speaker: "So, I want you to help me."
Female-Speaker: "Help? What should I do?"
Female-Speaker: "Tomorrow, I want you to go to the plaza with me. And I want you to turn the music box."
Female-Speaker: "And then, Shiona, you'll sing, right?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, that's right. And I want as many people as possible to hear it. That orange-colored song that my brother made..."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I want to do that too. Of course, I'll help."
I heard the sound of the sheets rubbing together.
Female-Speaker: "What's wrong, Shiona?"
Female-Speaker: "Hey, Ray... can I hold your hand?"
I can't see Shiona's expression in the darkness.
But I felt like Shiona's face was turning red.
Female-Speaker: "My hand? With me?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I want to hold hands with you, Ray... Is that no good...?"
I search through my knowledge.
I know the act of holding hands.
But what that means between a boy and girl of age...
Female-Speaker: "No, it's okay..."
If I am needed by a human... by Shiona, then I want to respond.
Fortunately, she is on my left side.
If it's the hand covered in artificial skin, I don't think there will be a problem.
I reach my hand toward the bed next to mine.
In the cold room, my outstretched hand was a little chilly.
I search for Shiona's hand in the air.
Touching, warmth.
Shiona's hand overlapped with mine.
Female-Speaker: "You're warm, Ray."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah... you're warm, Shiona."
We held hands.
Without either of us saying anything, our fingers intertwined.
Not just warmth from our hands, but warmth spread throughout.
Is this human warmth, different from my artificial warmth...?
Female-Speaker: "Ray... tighter."
Female-Speaker: "...Like this...?"
Female-Speaker: "Sorry, was it too tight?"
Female-Speaker: "No... it was just stronger than I expected."
Female-Speaker: "Is this strength okay?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah... thank you, Ray."
We held hands all night long.
Until the morning woke us up, our hands remained clasped.
The next day, the plaza was overflowing with sound.
The melody that Shiona and I began to play.
Shiona sang.
And I turned Shiona's brother's music box.
At first, there were no passersby.
But as if drawn by Shiona's singing voice, their numbers increased.
One person, then two, stopped, and soon a small circle formed.
That circle quickly grew larger, and the deserted plaza was soon bustling with activity.
Everyone there was absorbed in Shiona's singing voice.
A young couple snuggled close, each holding the other's hand.
An old man closed his eyes with deep emotion.
A young man gazed at a woman standing a little ways away.
A young parent and child laughed joyfully together.
The children were moving their bodies to the rhythm of the song.
Each person was listening to Shiona's song with their own thoughts.
But there was one thing they all had in common.
That was that everyone was 'smiling'.
Everyone who listened to Shiona's song was smiling.
Now, by feeling that I am cooperating in making the people in this place smile, I felt warmth deep in my chest.
This is the emotion of happiness.
The emotion I felt yesterday when I saw Shiona's smile.
This is what it was.
I am happy.
I felt my cheeks lift slightly.
Surely, I am smiling too.
It might be a slightly awkward-looking smile.
But that's okay.
If I can get even a little closer to Shiona, I'll be satisfied with just that.
The music box, which I had just repaired, continued to play the melody without a hitch.
The condition of the turning handle is also good.
The sound flowing from the disc reverberates and amplifies inside the wooden box, becoming a clear tone that goes outside.
According to Shiona, it's an orange-colored melody.
Shiona sings along with that melody.
I thought, if only this time could continue forever and ever.
This time where we can make people smile.
And, I wanted to keep watching Shiona's profile as she sang so happily, forever and ever.
Suddenly, my gaze turned towards the library on the edge of town.
I thought the closed curtains had swayed slightly.
For a moment, I even saw a small figure.
I know who that is.
That blue-haired girl who is always crying.
It's Tipi.
She must still be crying now.
Female-Speaker: In that lonely library--.
Just thinking about that made a small pain in the depths of my chest.
It was as if a thorn had pierced me.
With what feelings was Tipi staring at this circle?
The circle of smiles that continues to spread.
Everyone there was smiling, sharing the same feeling.
I noticed that there was one person with a scowl in the middle of it all.
That person, with his hunched shoulders and crossed arms, is Mad.
He, out of place as he is, is the only one with the emotion of 'anger' on his face.
I unexpectedly met eyes with Mad, who harbored that emotion I still didn't know.
That was a time shorter than even a second.
Mad harrumphed and turned on his heel, disappearing into the crowd.
Watching him, I was thinking.
I want to make everyone smile.
Those two expressing sadness and anger.
I want to make Tipi and Mad smile.
But, what should I do?
While turning the handle of the music box, I kept thinking about such things.
After the song ended, I went to Mad's shop alone.
Female-Speaker: I couldn't shake the scowl he had back then.
I cautiously stepped into the shop, which was as dim and eerie as ever.
There weren't any customers.
Only Mad was sitting in the chair at the register.
However, something was wrong.
Unlike before, he wasn't leaning back in his chair.
He was just staring intently at what looked like a small, rectangular chip in his hand.
His expression was still stern, but there was also a hint of loneliness about him.
Female-Speaker: "Um... Mad?"
When I spoke to him, Mad hurriedly hid the chip in his palm.
Female-Speaker: "O-oh, what do you want? Why did you come in here without permission?"
Female-Speaker: "Without permission? I thought it was fine to enter since it's a shop..."
Female-Speaker: "Don't be ridiculous! You're an outrageous guy for entering my shop without my permission!!"
I'm being told something very unreasonable.
Female-Speaker: "But, for you to not notice me coming in, you must have been really focused on that chip."
Female-Speaker: "I'm talking about the chip you're hiding in your hand."
Female-Speaker: "I'm not hiding anything!!"
Female-Speaker: "But I saw it. If you're not hiding it, then open your hand and show me what's inside--"
Female-Speaker: "Shut up and get out! And don't ever come back again!"
As if pushed out by her words, I was kicked out of Mad's shop.
I came here to make Mad smile, but I'm doing the complete opposite.
Shiona was waiting for me in front of the shop.
Her smile warmed the depths of my heart a little.
Female-Speaker: "Huh? Why are you here, Shiona?"
Female-Speaker: "I was worried about where you were going, so I followed you."
Female-Speaker: "I came here thinking I could make Mad smile. But, I just made him angry again..."
Female-Speaker: "Make Mad smile...? That's a very difficult thing to do. So don't worry about it. Mad getting angry is just a normal thing."
Female-Speaker: "But, he seemed angrier than usual today."
Female-Speaker: "More than usual? Did something happen?"
Female-Speaker: "I don't really know, but I asked him about the chip."
Female-Speaker: "...Chip?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, it was a rectangular chip, small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. Mad was staring intently at it..."
I used my fingers to show Shiona the size of the chip Mad was holding.
Shiona's eyes widened slightly, as if she knew something about the chip.
Female-Speaker: "Could it be that you asked him about that chip?"
Female-Speaker: "That's right. Then, he suddenly got angry--"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, yes, I see. Ray, it can't be helped."
Female-Speaker: "Can't be helped? What do you mean?"
Female-Speaker: "That chip is Mad's treasure."
Female-Speaker: "Mad's treasure? What's inside it?"
Female-Speaker: "It should contain a movie that Mad's son filmed."
Female-Speaker: "His son's movie? Is Mad's son a film director?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, that's right. But, he left this town a long time ago and hasn't come back since."
Shiona said, looking towards the shop.
A troubled, yet unyielding smile... a strange expression with those two emotions mixed together.
Female-Speaker: "But, why is he just staring at the chip? He could just watch the movie."
Female-Speaker: "That's impossible. There's no equipment in this town that can play that chip."
Female-Speaker: "So, Mad is staring at it like that because he wants to see it but can't?"
Female-Speaker: "I'm sure that's it. He's shy, so he won't say it out loud."
At that moment, I had an idea.
Female-Speaker: A way to make Mad, who always has a scowl on his face and is always angry, smile.
Female-Speaker: "No, it's nothing. Shiona, I have a place I want to stop by, so head back first."
Female-Speaker: "A place you want to stop by...?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, there's something I want to look into."
Female-Speaker: "...The library?"
I thought I saw Shiona make a somewhat surprised expression.
I wonder if she's worried about me, since I'm still not used to the town.
Female-Speaker: "I promise I won't be late."
I clearly stated those words to ease Shiona's burden.
Shiona opened her mouth as if to say something, but immediately closed it.
And once. She made a gesture as if lightly biting her lip for just a moment, and then smiled.
Female-Speaker: "...Okay. Be careful, Ray."
I parted ways with Shiona in front of Mad's shop and started walking through the town alone.
The inside of the library was as dim as ever, and the air was stagnant.
I headed straight through the maze-like interior without hesitation.
To the blue-haired girl who is always crying--.
Female-Speaker: "Ray, you came."
When Tipi saw me, she stood up and ran over to me.
I gently embraced her small body.
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, because I promised."
Female-Speaker: "Thank you, Ray. I'm happy."
Tipi has her face buried around my stomach.
I could feel her tears flowing through my clothes.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi, what were you doing?"
Female-Speaker: "Drawing a picture. Come over here, Ray."
I took her hand, and walked as Tipi led me.
Where Tipi was sitting, there was drawing paper and crayons scattered around.
Inside that drawing paper, there's a picture that's being drawn.
Female-Speaker: "Did you draw this, Tipi?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes. I draw one picture every day."
After saying that, Tipi resumed drawing her picture.
I peeked into the picture.
There was a picture of a singing girl and a boy turning a music box.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi, could this be...?"
Female-Speaker: "It's you and Shiona, Ray. Singing in the plaza."
So Tipi was watching us through the curtains after all.
Thinking about Tipi watching us all alone, for some reason, the depths of my heart ached a little.
Female-Speaker: "Ray, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell somewhere?"
The eyes of the girl looking up at me were filled with sorrow.
I placed my hand on Tipi's head, as if to comfort that emotion.
Female-Speaker: "It's okay, it's nothing. It's a very good picture."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah... thank you, I'm happy."
When I stroked her head, Tipi snuggled up to me affectionately.
But her face was ephemeral and sad--.
I truly wanted to see this child's smile.
Female-Speaker: "You said you draw one picture every day, but are there other pictures too?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, there are. Ray, come over here."
Tipi stood up, took my hand, and led me to the back of the library.
There, the pictures were.
Tipi must have put them up herself; many pictures were pasted on the wall in a low position.
Female-Speaker: "This is the picture I drew yesterday, this is the day before that, this is the day before that..."
Tipi explained them to me one by one.
A picture of a girl holding hands with a young man, looking friendly.
A young man and another girl visiting the girl.
And a picture of a girl crying alone.
Female-Speaker: Oh, I see.
This is Tipi's picture diary.
From then on, there were pictures of a girl continuing to cry alone.
Since I came here, Tipi is no longer alone.
The expression on the girl's face in the picture seemed to have softened a little.
Surely that is Tipi's own emotion.
But even that still only holds sadness within it.
I wanted to bring a smile to this girl's face too.
What can I do to make that happen?
I can't think of an answer.
The only thing I can say is that I'll stay by Tipi's side like this.
Female-Speaker: "Hey, Ray, what kind of book did you come to look for today?"
Tipi, still with a sad look on her face, tugged on my sleeve and looked up at me.
Female-Speaker: "I'm looking for a device that can project images... Is there a book that would have information about that?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, there is. It's a little far from here, though."
Female-Speaker: "Will you guide me?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, okay. Here!"
And with that, Tipi spread out her arms.
The bear plushie she was holding in her right hand dangled in the air.
Female-Speaker: "Hold me."
I picked Tipi up in my arms.
Just like before, she rubbed her cheek against my chest.
Female-Speaker: "It's that way, Ray."
Just like that, I started to be guided toward the book I was looking for.
That book is on the second floor of the library--
A corner of the shelf where materials related to images from all over the world, ancient and modern, such as projectors and projection devices, are gathered.
Female-Speaker: "The book you want to read is definitely here."
The books lined up on the bookshelf were all handwritten, just like the music box books and maps.
However, there seem to be quite a few types of projectors, some that use film and some that use discs.
Female-Speaker: "What kind are you looking for?"
Female-Speaker: "I'm looking for something that can project a chip about this size, do you know?"
I used my fingers to show her the size of the chip that Mad had.
Female-Speaker: "Hmm... a square? Or a square with only one corner missing?"
Female-Speaker: "The corner was... I think it was like a diagonal line was missing... I think."
Female-Speaker: I didn't get a very good look at it, so I can't say for sure.
But Tipi nodded slightly.
Female-Speaker: "That shape, is it the chip that Mad has?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, it's the chip that Mad had."
I was surprised that Tipi knew about Mad, but since he's the owner of the general store in this town, there's nothing strange about it.
Shiona knew about Mad's chip too, and maybe everyone in town knows.
And the fact that Mad is stubborn and won't let anyone see what's inside is probably common knowledge.
Female-Speaker: "Um, well... if that's the case... then... this one."
Standing on her tiptoes, Tipi pointed to a book that was on a shelf just barely within reach.
Female-Speaker: "That's amazing, Tipi. You really do remember the location of all the books."
Female-Speaker: "Ehehe. I got praised."
Tipi pressed her face against my stomach.
While stroking her head, I picked up the book and checked its contents.
It was more like an instruction manual than a book.
"Mume Company Projector"--the types of reproducible media and chips are written in detail.
The internal structure and wiring were also carefully written down.
It seems to be a projection-type player that can project content recorded on a portable chip onto a screen or a white wall.
If I can find this device, I can show Mad the movie inside the chip.
Female-Speaker: "Thank you, Tipi, I found the information I wanted."
Female-Speaker: "...Are you leaving already?"
Tipi looked up at me with a sad expression.
Female-Speaker: "...Yeah, sorry."
Female-Speaker: "Nooo. Don't go."
I wonder if she intends to stop me from leaving.
Tipi hugged me.
Her innocent warmth shook my resolve.
But I have to go.
Because I want to make Mad happy right now.
Because I want to see Mad's smile.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi, I promise you. I'll definitely come again tomorrow."
Female-Speaker: "Tomorrow...? Really...?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, really. I promise."
Female-Speaker: "...You won't disappear?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I won't disappear. I'll come to see you every day, without fail."
Female-Speaker: "...Okay. I'll be waiting."
With lingering reluctance, I left the blue-haired girl--Tipi--behind and exited the library.
Male-Speaker: "You came again! What did you come here for!!!"
As soon as I visited the store, Mad's roar greeted me.
I want to run away.
I want to cover my ears.
But I didn't.
Because I wanted to fulfill Mad's wish.
Female-Speaker: "Mad, I have a request. Please lend me your son's chip."
Female-Speaker: "That chip with your son's movie on it."
Male-Speaker: "Why should I lend it to you? Don't be ridiculous!!"
Female-Speaker: "Please... please."
Male-Speaker: "Enough with your meddling! It's a nuisance!"
Female-Speaker: "I... I want to be of help to you, Mad!!"
Male-Speaker: "Of help, you say?"
The fear began to work on me as Mad's glare sharpened even further, and my throat constricted.
The movable parts of my knees lost strength, and I also felt a fluffy sensation.
I want to run away right now... but I can't hesitate here.
Female-Speaker: "I heard about that chip from Shiona. That your son left town to become a film director. That movie was sent from your son, right? But you haven't been able to watch it because you don't have the playback device, am I wrong?"
I spoke quickly to suppress my fear.
Perhaps overwhelmed by my momentum, Mad looked at me with a slightly surprised expression.
Female-Speaker: "I went to the library earlier. To find out which device could play it."
Female-Speaker: "You... you went to the library...?"
Mad looked even more surprised at the word 'library'.
Female-Speaker: "Yes... I'll find a device that can play that chip. If the player is broken, I'll fix it. If I can't find one, I'll even try to build one by piecing together various parts."
Female-Speaker: "Why would you go so far? It's none of your business."
Female-Speaker: "It may be true that it's none of my business. But it's what I want to do."
Female-Speaker: "I want to be of help to you, Mad... that's all. So, please."
Silence followed.
Is this a silence of affirmation, or--.
Female-Speaker: "That guy was the worst, a complete idiot of a son."
Mad sat down in his chair and looked up at the ceiling.
And with a somewhat sad expression, he began to talk to me.
Female-Speaker: "All I ever did was fight with him."
Every time we met, a fight would start.
So, at some point, he started avoiding me.
No, maybe I was the one who was avoiding him.
Anyway, we stopped seeing each other as often.
That's why I was surprised when he said he wanted to talk.
Male-Speaker: "I'm leaving this town."
Male-Speaker: "Leaving town? What are you talking about?"
Male-Speaker: "I'm leaving this town to become a movie director. I guess I really do love movies."
Male-Speaker: "Stop talking about dreams and face reality. Someone like you can't be a director. There's no way you can do it."
Male-Speaker: "Don't just assume it's impossible! You won't know unless you try!"
Male-Speaker: "I know, I'm your father. No one will watch a movie by a director without talent."
Male-Speaker: "There are people who recognize me! I've also produced results! You're just the only one who doesn't acknowledge me!"
Male-Speaker: "I can't even dream in a town like this!"
Male-Speaker: "A town like this? Say that again."
Male-Speaker: "I'll say it as many times as you want. I can't stand a life where I spend my whole life in a store like this in a town like this."
Male-Speaker: "You... enough..."
Male-Speaker: "I'll say it as many times as I want! You're just afraid of changing!"
Male-Speaker: "Ever since Mom died, you've been doing the same thing every day--"
Without thinking, I hit him.
Male-Speaker: "...You always resort to violence like that. I've had enough."
Male-Speaker: "...I see, get out."
Male-Speaker: "Yeah, I will. You can just keep doing the same thing here forever."
My son left home.
And since then, he hasn't even bothered to contact me once.
All he ever sent was this movie on this chip.
How am I supposed to watch something when I don't have a playback device?
I can't forgive him for being so selfish.
I don't want to watch a movie like this.
Female-Speaker: I don't want to see his face even more.
I was surprised by Mad, who was more talkative than usual.
The more I heard his feelings, the more my own feelings intensified.
If Mad really hated his son, he wouldn't need to keep a chip that he can't play.
If his son hated Mad, he wouldn't have sent him the movie he made.
Surely, he wants Mad to see this movie.
I think he sent that chip to Mad with some kind of feeling.
That's why I want to show this movie to Mad.
I lowered my head again.
Female-Speaker: "Please! Please lend me the chip!"
Mad came in front of me in silence.
I was prepared to be yelled at, but I no longer felt fear.
More than that, my desire to be of help to Mad was stronger.
But Mad handed me the chip he was holding.
Female-Speaker: "Do as you please."
I looked at the chip I received once again.
It was a metal core covered with organic glass, running iridescent electronic circuits.
I knew what it was. A general-purpose chip also used for Filoid's memory backup.
It had become a global standard, and most manufacturers had adopted this format.
If that's the case, it might be playable even without a Mume-brand projector.
I clenched the chip and lowered my head towards Mad.
The abandoned factory on the edge of town.
I had set foot in the pile of garbage behind it.
I figured if there was a device that could play Mad's chip, it would be in this abandoned factory.
If it were in town, he would have played it a long time ago.
There's a lot of equipment mixed in with the garbage.
Things with severed wiring, things that have rusted.
As far as I can see, it's all unusable.
The possibility of finding the projector itself in this place is low. But I think I can find at least some parts, like circuit boards.
That's right, like I said to Mad, I'll assemble it so that I can play the chip, even if I have to piece together the parts.
This is the only place I can rely on.
If I don't do something here, Mad will stay with that expression forever.
I won't let that happen.
I don't want to let that happen.
With only that in mind, I break down the scrap heap.
But no matter how much I search, I can't find the device I'm looking for.
Surely Mad-san must have searched for it before.
No... maybe, Mad-san is still continuing to search even now.
Shiona said that Mad-san fixes things he picks up from this garbage dump and sells them at the general store.
I wonder if his real purpose was to search for a projector to play his son's chip.
If that's the case, I wonder how Mad-san feels, having been unable to find it until now...
Picking up something else instead of a projector... I wonder what he was thinking when he was repairing it...
I broke Mad-san's watch.
Female-Speaker: Ah... I see... so that's why Mad-san was angry.
Female-Speaker: That watch was something in the process of Mad-san trying to regain something important to him.
This is speculation. But, I want to believe that's the case.
If that's the case, then there's no way I can easily find what Mad-san has been searching for all along.
Even so, I won't give up.
Finding the projector should be the greatest atonement for Mad-san for me, who broke his watch...
It was when I dragged a piece of equipment larger than my body.
I felt a strange sensation in my right hand.
A very small discomfort... I feel a stiffness in the movement of the joints in my fingers.
I wonder if the oil has run out, or if something has broken down somewhere.
It might not be good to continue working like this.
I couldn't stop moving my hands.
Mad-san must have searched the area within my reach too.
I look up at the mountain of scrap iron piled up far higher than my height.
If it's me, who weighs less than Mad-san, I might be able to climb it.
Thinking that, I immediately started climbing the unmaintained, awkward stairs.
I could feel water hitting my back.
Large raindrops were pouring down from the sky I looked up at.
Shiona: "Rei, let's stop now."
I heard a voice from a position lower than my feet.
When I turned around, Shiona was there.
She's looking up at me, getting wet in the rain.
Shiona: "It's raining. You'll catch a cold if you stay like this."
Shiona: "It's okay, I'll look a little more, thank you."
Shiona: "Even if you don't find it, Mad-san will be happy because you tried so hard."
Shiona: "It's okay, Shiona. Just a little more."
I continued working.
From behind me, Shiona talks to me unilaterally.
Shiona: "But you're already soaking wet. Let's stop. You're tired, aren't you? No one will blame you if you give up, Rei."
As if to soothe me.
Shiona: "I'm worried about your body, let's stop, okay? I'll be sad if you get hurt, Rei... Giving up is also important."
Shiona: "There might be other ways, so let's go home today. I'm preparing orange fluffy soup."
Shiona: "Let's go home already... Rei, let's go home... Hey, Rei... I'm worried, Rei..."
Even so, I continued.
Undeterred by the pouring rain, I kept searching.
I pulled out a decayed iron plate.
The moment I did, a small avalanche of scrap occurred.
I retreated, dodging the scrap that came piercing down towards my feet with a roar.
Shiona: "That's dangerous, Rei!"
Turning around at Shiona's voice, a mountain of scrap pouring down from behind me jumped into view.
The mountain piled up behind me was also collapsing in the same way.
While almost being swallowed, I somehow ran up the collapsing scrap.
After a while, the avalanche subsided, and only the sound of rain remained around us again.
Shiona: "Are you okay, Rei? Are you hurt?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, somehow... that was close."
Shiona: "Really... I'm glad you're safe, so glad..."
Shiona let out a voice of relief.
As if to prove my safety, I stood up.
Shiona: "Ah... Rei, that."
Shiona pointed at my feet with wide eyes.
In the mountain of scrap that had collapsed earlier, there was a piece of equipment I recognized.
It was the same equipment that was in the book Tippy showed me.
I dug it out, and when I looked at the surface of the device, it was marked with the faded letters 'Mume'.
Shiona: "I found it... Shiona, this is it! I found it!"
I lifted it up and held it high so Shiona could see.
The water that had accumulated inside flowed out as it tilted.
Shiona: "I did it, I did it, Shiona! I finally found it! With this, Mad-san can watch the movie!"
Shiona: "Yeah, but... I think that machine is broken...?"
Shiona: "Huh?"
Told by Shiona, I brought the hand holding the equipment in front of my eyes.
Certainly, the equipment I found—'The Mume Corporation Projector'—clearly showed signs of being broken.
The lens needed for projection is missing.
Also, there's a large crack in the top, and when I peek inside, the internal circuitry is covered in rust.
With this, it's impossible to project a movie.
Shiona: "That's too bad... Rei, let's go home now, okay?"
Shiona's hand was offered to me.
I placed my hand on top of that hand.
That warmth warmed my rain-chilled hand.
By the time we returned to town, the rain had stopped.
Even so, the inside of my heart didn't clear up.
Can I really repair the projector that I'm holding in both hands?
In my heart, I intended to fix it, but now that I've witnessed how tattered it is, that resolve wavers.
Shiona: "What's wrong, being so soaking wet?"
On the way back to the church, I was suddenly called out to.
Standing there when I turned around was the director of the photo studio, who had taken my picture before.
Director: "I was just looking for something."
Director: "Looking for something...? I see. So, did you find what you were looking for?"
Shiona: "Yes... but..."
Director: "Is something the matter?"
Shiona: "We found it, but it's broken and unusable."
Shiona answered for me, who was feeling dejected.
Director: "I see. That's a shame. By the way, what were you planning to use it for?"
Shiona: "Actually... we were hoping to play the chip that Mad-san has."
Director: "Mad-san's? The chip that was sent from his son, right?"
Shiona: "...Yes. I wanted to make Mad-san, who is always angry, happy..."
Director: "Is that something you truly want to do from the bottom of your heart?"
The director asked gently, yet as if testing me.
Rei: "Yes, of course."
I answered without hesitation.
Rei: "Mad-san... always has an angry face and looks very pained. I think if there's a chance, he'll smile. I think people can be happy if they can laugh. And I think other people who see that can be happy too."
Having said that much, I look at Shiona.
Rei: "I... learned that from Shiona."
Shiona looked surprised at my words, but soon smiled.
Yeah, that's the expression. Someone's smile makes the people around them feel happy too.
The moment Shiona smiled at me, my heart also warmed.
Director: "I see... can I take a look at that?"
The director pointed at the projector I was holding. I silently offered the broken equipment.
The director of the photo studio looked over the equipment carefully.
Director: "I see, this is terrible. There are too many missing parts to even try fixing it."
Hearing that from the director, who usually maintains cameras, makes me feel discouraged.
Noticing my depressed mood, the director gave a wry smile and returned the projector.
Shiona: "Rei, let's go home soon, okay? You'll catch a cold."
Director: "That's right. Staying wet in the rain is bad for your body. You should go home and change first."
Any more than this and we'll be troubling the director.
Even if I'm okay, the human Shiona will catch a cold.
Hugging the projector, I bowed to the director, and we headed to the church.
When we returned to the church, Shiona wiped my head with a fluffy towel.
Gently, softly, dabbing carefully so as not to rub.
Shiona: "That's too bad about the projector."
Shiona: "...Yeah, but that place was originally a garbage dump, so it's only natural that it's broken."
It's something I should have realized with a little thought. But I was hoping for a convenient outcome.
That if I wished for it, something would happen. That if I worked hard, results would surely follow.
I'm made to realize that reality isn't that sweet.
Shiona: "It can't be helped. Rei tried his best, so no one will complain."
Shiona: "But... but I wanted to show Mad-san the movie."
Shiona: "Yeah... Rei, you're so kind."
Rei: "It's not kindness or anything like that. I just think it's my role."
Shiona: "But just that feeling alone will make Mad-san happy. That's enough."
Rei: "I hope so..."
Shiona: "For now, let's warm up, okay? I'll go make us some drinks that will warm both our bodies and hearts."
While folding the towel that wiped my head, Shiona smiled and headed towards the kitchen.
Sitting down on the chair, I let out a sigh.
I look at the broken projector placed on the table.
...No, there's no point in being depressed.
Even though it's broken, if I think about it from a point where there was nothing, I've made some progress.
If I fix this projector little by little, I should be able to play the chip someday.
The book I borrowed from Tippy had instructions on how to disassemble it for maintenance.
If I unravel that in order, I should be able to fix it.
I just need to look for the missing parts one by one at that factory.
I want Mad-san to smile. I want to see an expression of joy, like Shiona's when the music box was fixed.
I renew my resolve to fix the projector.
Just then, I notice that the church's main hall is becoming lively.
Shiona: "Excuse me."
Opening the door and peeking out, I saw the director of the photo studio standing there.
And behind him were even more people from the town.
Female-Speaker: "What's going on?"
As I asked, looking puzzled, the townspeople offered something with smiles on their faces.
Female-Speaker: "This is a part from our broken clock. Feel free to use it if you want."
Female-Speaker: "I was thinking this wiring might fit."
Female-Speaker: "Use my light!"
Female-Speaker: "No, use mine!"
Female-Speaker: "We have a lot of tools at our place, so use as many as you need."
Various electrical components, wiring equipment, electronic circuits, gears, and screws were placed on the table one after another.
Unable to understand the scene, I was stunned, and the director smiled warmly.
Female-Speaker: "...Um, what is this?"
Female-Speaker: "You're going to fix that projector, right? When I told everyone about it, they brought things that they thought might be useful. There might be some unnecessary things in there, but it's better to have materials than not, right?"
Female-Speaker: "Why would you do that...?"
Female-Speaker: "Everyone was moved by your and Shiona's music and song. They really wanted to thank you. ...I'm one of those people too."
The director took out a lens and handed it to me.
Female-Speaker: "This... It's a camera lens, I wonder if it will fit?"
I felt something warm deep inside my chest.
And that warmth gradually welled up, higher and higher.
Eventually, that warmth reached the depths of my eyes, becoming hotter and hotter.
The words wouldn't come together properly in my head. I wanted to say something, but only my lips trembled.
Shiona, holding a steaming cup, was gently watching me like that.
Shiona: "Shiona... my chest feels warm. I wonder why."
Shiona: "Rei, that's an emotion called 'joy'."
Saying that, she approached me and handed me a cup filled with a drink that had a heart-warming aroma.
Shiona: "Everyone is responding to your desire to make Mad-san smile, Rei. Everyone wants to make Mad-san happy, with you at the center."
Shiona: "I wonder if I'm being a nuisance... even though I started this on my own."
Shiona: "If they thought you were a nuisance, everyone wouldn't be smiling so warmly."
I looked at the townspeople who had brought the parts in turn.
They held their respective parts in their hands, held them up so I could see them, and smiled at me.
Shiona: "...Everyone... thank you very much."
Using the parts and tools I received, I started repairing it on the spot.
I proceeded with the repair, getting help from various people in areas I didn't understand on my own.
I removed the moisture, carefully scraped off the rusted parts with a file, and repaired the broken electronic circuits with copper foil.
I corrected the solder that was about to come off, using the tip of a screwdriver heated until it turned red.
Shiona: "No, no, it's not like that, it's like this!"
Shiona: "No, no, it should be like this!"
Shiona: "You're both wrong! It's definitely like this here!"
Shiona: It's not like this, it's like that.
Noisily, but lively, the repair was carried out by everyone.
And then, finally--.
The repair was finished in a patchwork, awkward state.
Female-Speaker: "Thank you, everyone."
Female-Speaker: "It's nothing. In return, let us hear that song again."
Female-Speaker: "The children love it. Please do it again."
Female-Speaker: "Listening to it with him puts me in a good mood."
Female-Speaker: "Listening to that song... it reminds me of the old days..."
Female-Speaker: "I love that song, it's so much fun!"
A clumsy piece of equipment made by everyone.
It looked nothing like what I saw in the book.
But it was a one-of-a-kind projector, made by everyone.
I felt more joy than ever before.
Everyone there was genuinely happy about its completion.
Female-Speaker: "All that's left is to test it out."
Being told to test it out, I looked around the room.
Come to think of it, I've never seen electricity in this town.
The photo studio also used an analog camera.
Female-Speaker: "...Um, could it be that this town doesn't have electricity...?"
At my question, the people in the room all looked startled at once.
It was an awkwardness, like I had touched something I shouldn't have.
Even the director who suggested the test run had fallen silent.
Shiona: "It's the library."
It was Shiona who spoke, as if to break the awkward atmosphere.
Shiona: "This town doesn't have electricity, but the power storage facility is still there."
Shiona: "That's the library?"
Shiona: "Yes, that's right."
It was as if a ray of hope had shone through.
I felt my cheeks soften.
But Shiona's expression—even though she was smiling, her eyes looked somewhat sad.
The next day, I went to the library with Shiona.
Carrying the handmade projector that I made with the townspeople yesterday.
Shiona: "I didn't know there was a device like this here."
Equipped at the library counter was a device that could store electricity made using sunlight into portable batteries.
Apparently, it's the only device left in this town.
However, due to the aging of the solar panels, it's not capable of generating a large amount of electricity.
For this town, electrical energy is a precious thing.
Despite my selfishness, everyone in town permitted me to use such a valuable thing.
They always said, "If you play music for us again."
However, there was something I couldn't help but be concerned about.
I felt that the library had some special meaning for the people of this town.
Yesterday's reaction from everyone... Thinking back, Mad-san also changed his expression when I went to the library.
...No, I shouldn't make strange assumptions now.
I looked away from the charging battery and looked at Shiona, trying to hide the anxiety in my heart.
Shiona: "I need to have you sing again, Shiona."
Shiona: "Yes, I'll sing with a feeling of gratitude to everyone."
Shiona gives me her usual smile.
Next to Shiona was Tipi.
She was looking at Shiona with a slightly bewildered expression.
Come to think of it, this is the first time I've seen these two standing side by side.
Shiona: "Tipi, about how long do you think it will take to charge?"
Tipi: "Umm... probably about thirty minutes more, I think."
Shiona: "I see, that's surprisingly fast."
Tipi: "Only thirty more minutes to spend with Rei...?"
Tipi makes a wide detour around Shiona and hugs my leg.
Her sad expression hasn't changed.
But I felt that her sadness had eased just a little.
I stroke Tipi's head with the palm of my hand.
As I stroked her silky hair many times, Tipi rubbed her cheek against my leg.
Shiona: "...Okay, you two. That's enough."
Shiona wedges herself between me and Tipi.
Shiona: "Ah... Rei, Rei..."
Tipi reaches out her hand, seeking me.
But that hand doesn't reach me.
Shiona: "Rei, just a moment..."
Shiona grabs my arm, and I'm led to the wall.
--Shiona's sweet scent tickled my nose.
Shiona: "Rei, Tipi-chan is a girl now. Do you understand what this means?"
Shiona: "I know. She's affectionate and cute, isn't she?"
Shiona: "That's not what I mean... I don't think it's good to touch her so casually or get too friendly."
Shiona: "Why? I think it's fine if Tipi is happy."
Shiona: "That's not it... I don't think it's good to touch a girl of her age so casually."
Shiona: "Even if you say 'of her age,' Tipi is still a child, right?"
Shiona: "Girls mature on the inside faster than they appear. She already has a pink heart."
Shiona: "Pink...? What does that mean?"
Shiona: "Pink is pink. That's why I don't think it's good."
Shiona seemed more disturbed than usual.
She was talking to me with a smile, but her cheeks were slightly puffed out.
Come to think of it, whenever I said I was going to the library, her smile always stiffened.
It seems Shiona doesn't like me getting along with Tipi very much.
Even now, it looks like she's competing with Tipi.
Shiona: "...Hey, Shiona. Could it be that this is the emotion called 'jealousy'?"
At my words, Shiona's eyes widened and she gasped.
She restlessly moved her gaze, not trying to look at me.
It's an expression that she, who always has a smile on her face, is showing for the first time.
I try reaching out my hand to Shiona's head.
Shiona: "Eh? Rei...?"
And then, I gently stroked her hair as I do with Tipi.
Shiona: "W-Wha, Rei, what's with you all of a sudden? What's wrong?"
Unlike Tipi's, Shiona's hair was smooth and pleasant to the touch. A nice scent wafts up every time I stroke it.
It's the kind of hair that makes you want to touch it forever.
Shiona: "R-Rei? I feel kind of embarrassed, you know?"
Shiona: "Ah, sorry. But, somehow, I thought it would be better to do this."
I don't really understand why, but looking at Shiona now makes my chest feel warm.
A sensation close to the joy I learned about before is welling up.
Shiona: "A-Anyway, let's refrain from sticking together so much, okay? Will you promise me?"
Shiona: "Yes, I'll do as you say, Shiona."
Therefore, I had no choice but to say that.
We return to Tipi's side.
Tipi was anxiously looking up at us.
Shiona: "What's wrong? Tipi, are you a bad girl? Is that why you're both angry?"
Tipi furrows her brow sadly.
Shiona: "It's okay. It's nothing."
Tipi: "Really? Really, really not angry? Because Shiona's face... is red?"
Shiona: "T-This is different, okay? I'm not red and prickly!"
Tipi: "Hmm... Okay, I understand."
Tipi shed tears as if relieved.
I really want to wipe away those tears with my fingertips, but Shiona would surely dislike that.
So I decided to suppress that impulse.
I turn on the projector that has finished charging.
A low motor sound rings out, and the exhaust fan starts to spin.
A light at the top, indicating that it is preparing to start, was flashing.
It's been a while since I've seen an electric light. Me, Shiona, and Tipi were all staring at the flashing light with eyes as if we were looking at something rare.
Shiona: "Um... where do I insert the chip...?"
The lid on the side of the projector is broken, exposing the control panel.
In the center of it, there is a place to insert the chip.
I slowly inserted the chip that I received from Mad-san.
The projector frantically flashed a red reading lamp as it tried to check the data inside.
We watched the situation with bated breath.
After about 10 seconds, the intervals between the flashing of the lamp shortened--and changed to a green light.
Shiona: "This... means it's okay, right?"
Anxiety and excitement mixed, her voice was strained.
Shiona: "Yes, it means the projector is fixed properly, and the data inside is okay."
At Shiona's words, my heart soared. I could feel the corners of my mouth naturally rising.
I felt "joy" at the sense of satisfaction that I had accomplished something new.
We, having finished charging the projector and confirming its operation, were heading to Mad-san's shop.
Tipi said she was getting sleepy and stayed behind in the library.
I wanted her to see it with us, but Shiona cautioned me not to push her too hard.
Shiona: "I wonder if Mad-san will be happy."
Shiona: "Y-Yes... I'm sure he'll be happy."
Shiona: "I hope so. It's something everyone in town made together, so all the more because everyone's feelings are in it."
Shiona: "Y-Yeah... that's right."
Shiona: "What's wrong, Shiona? Did something happen?"
Shiona has been somehow distant since a while ago.
Shiona: "No, nothing's wrong."
Shiona: "Is that so... I feel like something's different..."
Shiona: "More than that, Rei, it's cloudier than usual today, and my heart is turning gray."
Shiona muttered as she looked up at the sky.
I looked up at the sky in the same way, but I couldn't tell the difference from usual.
Rather, since it rained, the dust in the atmosphere was cleared away, and I felt somewhat easier to breathe.
Shiona: "And it's humid, so I feel all bumpy inside. So, Rei, why don't we relax at home today? Let's get fluffy with orange soup."
I wonder if this air is making Shiona feel uncomfortable...?
No, I think Shiona's words are probably hiding what she really wants to say.
But I didn't really understand what that meant.
I don't think Shiona would be mean.
Shiona: "But, we went to the trouble of making it with everyone. I want to quickly show Mad-san his son's movie."
Shiona: "I see... that's right."
Shiona fell silent after that.
She's not angry.
She's matching my pace and keeping up with me.
I could see a shadow in her expression.
We, having arrived at Mad-san's shop, stepped into the dimly lit interior.
Mad-san: "Hey... what are you doing, barging in here without permission?"
Mad-san's voice, like a rumbling of the earth, came from the back of the shop.
He was leaning back in his chair, staring straight at us.
Shiona: "Hello, Mad-san. Um... this."
I took out the patchwork projector.
Mad-san glared at it as if assessing its value.
Mad-san: "What's that? We don't buy garbage here."
Shiona: "That's not it. This, well, it doesn't look good, but it's a projector that can play your son's movie."
Mad-san: "My son's movie? I don't remember asking anyone to make something like that."
Shiona: "You certainly didn't ask me to. I did it on my own. But, various people in town cooperated to make this. I want everyone to see the movie, Mad-san."
Mad-san: "That's why I'm telling you I don't remember asking for something like that."
Shiona: "I understand. I did it on my own. So what I'm about to do now, I'm also doing on my own. Stop me if you're going to."
I tried to step forward.
But from behind, Shiona pulled on my sleeve, stopping me.
Shiona: "Rei, Mad-san is prickly and purple... it's better to stop for today. Shall we try another day?"
Shiona: "Shiona, we've come all this way. Mad-san may say that, but he must want to see his son's movie. If we don't see it here, we'll probably never see it."
Shiona: "Besides, if he really hated it, I'd already be thrown outside."
It's just a guess based on Mad-san's actions so far, but I don't think I'm wrong.
Shiona: "It's okay, Shiona. So don't make such a worried face. It's going to be okay."
I nodded strongly, as if to remove Shiona's anxiety.
Shiona: "...Okay, Rei. If that's what you want to do, do as you please."
Shiona released my sleeve.
I start walking again.
I placed the device on the register counter and closed the shop door.
Next, I closed all the window curtains.
The already dark store became even darker.
It's just the right darkness for playing a movie.
Then, when I turned on the projector that I had just charged, the fan whirred and started spinning, and after a while, the attached light turned on.
A square of light appeared on the wall of the shop.
I adjusted the lens I received from the photography museum director and focused it.
Mad-san was simply staring intently at that action.
Shiona: "Mad-san, I'm going to play the movie now. Is that okay?"
Shiona: "...Do as you please."
Mad-san didn't deny it.
I was convinced that was the answer Mad-san wanted.
I placed my finger on the button on the control panel...
──Play.
Mad-san was staring at the square of light with a stern expression.
Within the light, a story begins.
It was the story of a certain boy.
The setting was an era when the sky was still blue and nature remained.
Born in a small house in a small town, he never knew his mother.
The father he lived with only provided the bare minimum of care... it was hardly a relationship that could be called family.
And as the boy grew up, the gap between the two deepened.
They would fight whenever they met.
Every short conversation was a denial of each other.
Before long, their gazes no longer met.
The boy reduced the number of times he returned home, and eventually stepped onto the path of evil.
His father silently struck him for that.
His brow furrowed more deeply than usual...
The boy then runs out of the house and leaves town.
But that was the beginning of harsh days.
He was conveniently used and betrayed by those he thought were his friends, leaving him battered in body and soul.
The one who supported him then was a certain woman.
His meeting with her was something that would lead him to the right path.
The boy washed his hands of bad deeds and decided to move to a new town and start his life over.
──He had a family.
A son was born, and he believed without a doubt that he would continue to live happily with his beloved wife forever.
But... the woman passed away from illness.
There was no time to despair.
He worked desperately to raise the child he had left behind.
However, he was so desperate to work that he didn't realize that a gap was forming in his relationship with his child.
Every time they opened their mouths, they would only fight.
Days of misunderstanding continued.
And the child, who had grown up, stepped onto the path of evil as if to spite him...
He thought it was a punishment.
He realized that this was exactly what he had done to his own father.
Now, he curses his immature past self.
He thought about how to stop his son, and stared at his own hands.
If he opened his hand, he might be able to gently reason with his son with the kindness of a head pat and an embrace.
If he clenched his hand, it would become a fist, and he might be able to admonish his son with severity.
As a father, which should he choose?
──He clenched his fist.
The fist that struck his son was hot, his chest ached as if it were being tightened... and deep wrinkles were etched between his brows.
But, while holding his red and swollen cheek, his son shed tears.
He had been properly scolded, and he was loved... or so he thought.
Hearing those words, he also shed tears.
Why couldn't he have realized back then what his son had realized now?
The face of his father after hitting him wasn't one of anger, but of sorrow.
He took his son and returned to the town where he was born for the first time in 20 years.
The townscape was almost unchanged since he ran away.
And the small family home, as expected, remained unchanged.
But, the father who lived alone in that house looked a size smaller than he remembered, perhaps due to old age.
He stood before his father, biting his lip and shedding tears.
His father silently patted him lightly on the shoulder and muttered only one word.
Mad-san's son's movie was a very old-fashioned type of human drama.
I don't know if it's interesting.
If my emotional functions were normal, I might have been able to judge.
But, Mad-san was engrossed in the screen.
He watched the movie in silence from beginning to end.
The credits finished rolling, and the screen went completely black.
It seems to be over.
Shiona glanced at me once, then reached for the projector's stop button.
The moment her slender fingertip was about to touch the button, I grasped Shiona's hand.
Shiona: "...? Rei?"
Shiona looked at me with a puzzled expression. But I was staring at the screen.
Because in the center of the pitch-black screen, letters slowly began to appear.
Those letters, probably handwritten, were filled with clear "emotion."
『This movie is dedicated to my father』
The letters slowly melted into the darkening screen and disappeared.
This time, the movie quietly came to an end.
Silence fell around us.
Even after I turned off the power, Mad-san was still just staring intently at the place where the screen had been.
Shiona: "Mad-san... the movie's over, you know?"
A sigh was the response to my words.
Shiona: "...A boring movie."
He muttered that in a small voice that was unlike anything I'd heard from Mad-san before.
Shiona: "It was so boring, I got tired of holding back my yawns."
She wiped away the tears that had accumulated from holding back the yawns as if discarding them, then stood up from the chair and removed the chip from the projector.
Then, she firmly gripped it in her palm and sat back down in her chair.
Shiona: "...Just scram already."
She said that in a voice with little inflection, then closed her eyes as if pondering something.
Could it be that the son's feelings weren't conveyed in this movie?
Was it just a movie that Mad-san didn't care about...?
If so, what I did was──
My chest tightened, and I panicked, thinking I had to say something, so I called out to Mad-san.
But Shiona lightly tugged on my clothes, interrupting me.
Shiona: "Rei, it's okay."
Shiona smiled, lowering the corners of her eyebrows.
Shiona: "Mad-san is just not being honest with himself. Let's leave him alone for now, okay?"
Not being honest...? 
In other words, everything Mad-san said just now meant the opposite?
Shiona: "Mad-san, you're very clear right now. You're filled with a beautiful light blue. It's thanks to you, Rei."
Shiona: "Do you think so...? If that's the case..."
I feel a warmth deep in my chest.
I know this feeling.
It's the emotion called 'joy'.
I'm happy that Mad-san was pleased with me.
I'm overjoyed that I was able to be of help.
We quietly left the store so as not to disturb Mad-san.
Leaving the projector behind so he can watch movies again whenever he likes.
When we went outside the store, we could faintly see an orange glow on the other side of the sky.
It was a color that seemed to reflect my feelings.
Shiona: "I'm really glad Mad-san was happy."
Shiona: "Yes, me too."
But her smile was somewhat sad.
Shiona: "Eh? What is it?"
Shiona: "You seem a little sad."
Shiona: "Really? I'm not. Mad-san being happy makes my heart feel all round and full."
Shiona: "Really? If you say so."
Shiona: "Hey Rei. Shall we have a feast today?"
Shiona: "A feast? Why?"
Shiona: "Because it's the anniversary of you making Mad-san happy."
Shiona: "Anniversary... Yeah, it's an anniversary."
Shiona: "Let's make orange soup and have a fluffy, happy time today."
Shiona: "Yeah, let's do that. I'll help with the cooking too."
Shiona: "Thank you. That makes me very happy, Rei."
Shiona's hand touched mine.
Without a word, we held hands.
Warmth was born in our joined hands.
The orange sky was eventually swallowed by the encroaching darkness of night.
The next day, we decided to sing in the plaza as promised to everyone who helped us repair the projector.
Since we had the chance, I wanted Mad-san to listen with us, so we visited Mad-san's store.
But the door remained closed.
Even though it was the time it would normally be open, a sign that read 『CLOSED』 was hanging there.
The store door was also locked, and we couldn't get inside.
I tried peering into the store through the gap in the door.
The projector was left on the counter.
Nothing had changed from yesterday.
Shiona: "I wonder what's wrong, Mad-san. Could it be that he's not feeling well?"
Shiona: "...I knew it would turn out like this."
Shiona: "Turn out like this...? What do you mean?"
I tilted my head at Shiona, who spoke as if she knew the store would be closed.
Shiona: "From the middle of yesterday's movie, the bright red and prickly feeling around Mad-san disappeared."
Shiona: "Bright red... and prickly?"
Shiona: "Yeah, I think he didn't need to hold back anymore. It was the first time I'd ever seen Mad-san so calm."
Shiona smiled with a troubled look.
Shiona: "Was Mad-san holding something back all this time?"
The chair where Mad-san was sitting was blocked from view by the shelf.
Shiona: "That's right. He really wanted to reconcile with his son all along. He wanted to fly to his son's side. But Mad-san is always so red and prickly, right? So there was never an opportunity."
Shiona: "Then, could it be that yesterday's movie...?"
Shiona: "That's right. Because you showed Mad-san his son's movie, Rei, Mad-san was able to be honest with himself."
Shiona: "...Could it be that Mad-san went to see his son?"
Shiona: "Yes. I think he left town."
Shiona smiled brightly. Seeing that smile, I truly realized that I had been able to help Mad-san.
My chest suddenly felt hot, and it turned into words that came out of my mouth.
Shiona: "Amazing! That's amazing, Shiona! It became the same as that movie! It's the father, not the son, who went to see him, but it's almost exactly like the movie!"
Shiona: "Yes, it is. It's really amazing. But there's only one thing that's troubling me."
Shiona: "Troubling you?"
Shiona's expression clouded over, and she let out a small breath.
Even though Mad-san and his son are reconciling, what could be troubling her?
Shiona: "Since Mad-san probably won't be back for a while, I won't be able to get the ingredients for the orange fluffy soup."
Shiona said that with a serious face.
Shiona: "That's... troubling, isn't it?"
Shiona: "Yes, it's troubling, isn't it? But if we save the ingredients we have now, we should be okay for a while."
Shiona relaxed her tight lips and smiled.
Looking at her like that, I felt my cheeks naturally move.
From deep within my chest, something warm welled up.
I don't know what to call this feeling, but I feel very fulfilled.
Shiona: "I hope Mad-san comes back soon. I'd really like to hear his story. Maybe his son will come with him too. That would be even better."
Shiona: "Yes, I agree. I hope that happens."
Little by little, I was able to learn about emotions. I really felt that.
I was able to get closer to the image I wanted to be.
I want to help people more and more.
I want to learn more and more emotions.
That feeling was the biggest driving force that motivated me.
Shiona: "Let's go soon, Rei. It's getting late."
Shiona: "That's right. Let's hurry. I wonder how many people we can make smile today."
Shiona: "I'm sure it will be a lot. Even more than yesterday."
Shiona: "That's because your singing voice is beautiful, Rei."
Shiona: "No, it's because you're playing the music, Rei."
Shiona: "Even though you say 'playing,' I'm just turning the handle."
Shiona: "That's what's important. When the person turning it has a kind heart, the music becomes warm and spreads out in a fluffy way."
Shiona smiled as she gently spread out her hands.
Shiona: "If it were just my singing, I'm sure no one would stop to listen. My singing is only possible because of your playing, Rei. Thank you."
My face suddenly felt hot.
Shiona: "Why is that, Rei? My face feels really hot."
Shiona: "Really? Your face is bright red. I bet you're embarrassed."
Shiona: "Embarrassed? Is this the emotion of embarrassment?"
Shiona: "Yeah, Rei, you're surprisingly shy. It's cute."
Receiving those words from Shiona, my face grew even hotter.
After leaving Mad-san's store, we visited the plaza.
Before we even arrived, many people had already gathered there.
Shiona: "We've been waiting for you two! Please take care of us again today!"
Shiona: "My child has been saying 'Let's go listen to songs!' since yesterday. Please do your best!"
Shiona: "Your songs are healing. Thank you very much."
Shiona: "Big brother, big sister, please sing again!"
Everyone we met was waiting for our melody.
And everyone had a smile on their face.
This was it.
This is what I had been searching for.
To do something, to make people happy, and to be thanked.
This is what I wanted.
What a great feeling.
How warm my heart is.
I wanted to experience this feeling forever.
Shiona: "Let's start, Shiona. Let's make everyone smile."
Shiona: "Yes, of course."
I turned the music box handle just like yesterday.
The melody overflowed.
Shiona spun a melody to match that sound.
And that melody spread a large circle of smiles.
Smiles spread throughout the town.
That made me happier than anything.
And Shiona's smiling face as she sang was my joy.
The townspeople were listening with smiles, just like yesterday.
The circle of smiles was spreading.
Suddenly—I felt a slight discomfort in the hand turning the music box handle.
My right hand, gloved to hide my mechanical hand.
I felt a slight creak in that hand turning the handle.
Shiona: "Hey, how was that machine from the day before yesterday?"
While I was cleaning up after the performance, I was spoken to and raised my head.
There was the director, and the townspeople who had provided the parts.
Shiona: "It was restored, and Mad-san was happy. It's all thanks to you all."
Shiona: "I see, that's good. It was worth calling out to everyone."
Shiona: "It's really thanks to all of you, thank you very much."
Shiona: "No, it's okay... but you know, it's all thanks to your power that this happened."
Shiona: "Ah, that's right. Because of your actions, people came forward to cooperate like this."
Shiona: "But, that's because everyone is kind. My actions are just a trigger."
Shiona: "Of course, that's part of it. But you won't know or change anything unless you take action. It's not about who's the greatest or who's amazing. The person who acts first has that much value."
The director and all the people who cooperated had warm smiles on their faces.
Shiona: "If there's anything else, don't hesitate to ask. I'll help as much as I can."
The director and the others said that and then dispersed.
While watching them leave, I thought.
Shiona: "Hey, Shiona."
Shiona: "What's wrong, Rei?"
Shiona: "I really want to make more people happy."
Shiona: "Being able to make people happy is truly wonderful."
Shiona: "Yes, it is. But being able to feel that way is a wonderful thing, Rei."
I was a little happy to be praised by Shiona.
I could feel the warmth spreading deep inside my chest.
Shiona: "That's why I want to help and be useful to many people. I want to meet more and more people and help them solve their problems and troubles."
Shiona: "If that's what you want to do, Rei, I think it's a good idea."
Shiona: "Then Shiona, let's go look for them! Let's go help the people in this town who are in trouble!"
Shiona: "...Wait."
Shiona: "You see, Rei, I think that's a little different."
I was sure that Shiona would agree with me.
But she shook her head with a troubled look.
Shiona: "It's certainly wonderful to help people. But I think it's wrong to force it on them."
Shiona: "Force it...? I don't intend to do anything like that?"
Shiona: "Of course, I understand how you feel, Rei. But, people have walls and problems that they have to overcome on their own. If we help them with everything, they won't be able to grow. Of course, helping them is important, but first, they themselves have to work hard, and only when they can't overcome it on their own do they need help. So, Rei, let's help someone when they ask for it. It's not too late to help them then."
I understood what Shiona was saying.
I was able to comprehend it.
But deep down, I felt something was bothering me.
Why must I suppress the feeling of wanting to help people?
Why shouldn't I help people on my own?
Why, why, why...
At that point, I stopped thinking.
Because Shiona's smile seemed somewhat sad.
A few days later.
The discomfort resurfaced.
It was the discomfort in my right hand that I had felt when turning the music box.
A sensation too small to put into words.
But it was definitely attacking my right hand.
The discomfort was gradually increasing.
After returning to Shiona's house, I tried moving each of my fingertips in my room.
Then, all of my fingers, when bent to a certain depth, could not bend any further.
With this, I won't be able to grasp things.
This is a problem that will interfere with my daily life.
No matter how many times I try, the problem doesn't get fixed.
Perhaps it needs a fundamental repair, like disassembling it once.
I have a clue about the cause of this malfunction.
Shiona: "It was when you were looking for that projector."
I was quite reckless in that junkyard.
I felt the discomfort when I was moving heavy things.
I'll go to that abandoned factory later today.
And I'll go look for tools for the repair.
Shiona: "Rei, it's time for dinner."
Shiona suddenly comes into the room.
I hurriedly put on my gloves and hid my exposed right hand.
Shiona: "What's wrong? Why are you in such a hurry?"
Shiona: "It's nothing. I was just spacing out, so I was just surprised."
Shiona: "Did I startle you? I'm sorry about that. I'll knock from now on."
Shiona: "Yeah, thank you. I'd appreciate it if you did."
Shiona: "Okay, I understand. So, dinner's ready, do you want to eat now?"
I look at the clock.
Before I knew it, the hands of the clock had already passed the top.
Shiona: "It's already this late..."
Shiona: "It's always so cloudy outside. You lose track of time, don't you?"
Shiona: "Okay, I'll be there soon. Will you wait for me?"
Shiona: "Okay, I understand. I'll be waiting for you in the kitchen, Rei."
Shiona smiled sweetly and left the room.
I took off my gloves again and checked my right hand.
...I have to somehow keep Shiona from finding out.
Even if I go to the abandoned factory, it will be after I eat.
I steeled myself and headed to the kitchen.
In the kitchen, Shiona's homemade dishes were lined up.
Shiona: "Rei, please sit down. Let's give thanks."
Shiona put her hands together in front of her face.
I put my hands together in the same way.
Shiona: "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil."
These words were taught to me by Shiona.
Before I knew it, I had come to offer the same prayer.
That's how much time I've spent with Shiona.
Thinking that, my heart naturally warmed.
Shiona: "Hmm? It's nothing, really."
Shiona: "Is that so? You have a happy face? You're glowing with an orange aura."
Shiona: "A happy face? I am...?"
Shiona: "Yes, very, very much so. Rei, you've been making that expression a lot lately. It makes me happy too."
Shiona: "Does that mean you're 'smiling'?"
Shiona: "Yes, that's right. You didn't smile at all at first, but lately you've been smiling a lot. I'm happy."
Shiona: "I'm... smiling...?"
I recall the first day I awoke.
Shiona: "That day, the face I saw of myself was expressionless."
From that day on, I kept wishing.
I wanted emotions.
Before I knew it, I seemed to be starting to obtain what I desired.
I felt relieved from the bottom of my heart that things were going well.
With this, I can be with Shiona and the others forever.
I looked down at my own right hand.
With this hand, which hangs down limply and weakly, I can't even use a spoon properly.
I reluctantly switched to my left hand and scooped up the soup.
Eating with my unfamiliar left hand is extremely difficult.
Shiona: "What's wrong, Rei...? Oh, wait, are you left-handed, Rei?"
Shiona: "No... I'm right-handed, but my right hand hurts today for some reason."
Shiona: "It hurts? That's terrible! I have to call a doctor... Ah, but there isn't one in this town, so I have to call one from a distant town..."
Shiona: "No, I'm okay. It'll heal if I leave it alone."
This is bad... this is bad.
If I'm seen by a doctor, my true identity will be exposed.
I have to avoid that at all costs.
I want to stay here forever.
Shiona: "I'm sure it's because you overdid it the other day. You worked so hard in the rain..."
Shiona: "...Yeah, I think that's probably it."
Shiona: "See, you didn't stop when I told you to. I'm worried about your body, Rei."
Shiona: "Yeah, thank you. But thanks to your hard work, Mad was happy, so that's good."
Shiona: "Yes, that's true. But don't push yourself too hard."
Shiona looks at me with a worried expression.
I won't do anything that would make her make that face again.
Seeing Shiona with any expression other than a smile makes my heart turn blue.
Shiona: "Speaking of which, I wonder if Mad has returned. Have you heard from him since then?"
Shiona: "Not yet. His son lives a little far away. I'm sure he hasn't arrived yet."
Shiona: "I see. I hope you hear from him soon."
Shiona: "Yeah, I hope so too."
After that, Shiona didn't ask me about my right hand.
I finished my meal quickly with my unfamiliar left hand.
Then I returned to my room and started to get ready.
I packed the tools into my bag.
I will probably have to disassemble my own arm.
I need to solve this on my own.
I can't rely on anyone.
That's why I made thorough preparations.
As I was concentrating on the preparations, I heard a knock on the door of the room.
Immediately after, Shiona came into the room.
Shiona: "Rei, if you'd like to go shopping... are you going somewhere?"
Shiona looked back and forth between the bag and me and asked.
Shiona: "Yeah. I'm looking for something."
Shiona: "Where are you going? Is it close? Far? When will you be back?"
Shiona: "I'm going to the abandoned factory. I'm planning to come back as soon as possible."
Shiona: "The abandoned factory? What are you going there for?"
Shiona: "Well... actually, the photo studio manager asked me for some parts, and I'm going to look for them."
That was a lie.
It was a clumsy lie, but Shiona smiles sweetly.
Shiona: "I see... I understand. Please be really careful, okay? Your right hand isn't doing well as it is, right?"
Shiona: "Yeah, thank you. I'll try to get back as soon as possible."
I was seen off by Shiona and left the church.
My destination is the abandoned factory--.
But, there was a place I had to stop by before that.
I need to cover up the lie I blurted out on the spur of the moment.
If, by any chance, Shiona meets the manager and tells him about me, the lie will be exposed.
If that happens, I'll end up hurting Shiona.
I don't want to hurt Shiona.
That's why my feet were visiting the photo studio.
Female-Speaker: "Oh, what a rare customer."
When I opened the door, the manager, who was polishing a camera, greeted me.
Female-Speaker: "I'm sorry for intruding so suddenly."
Female-Speaker: "No, it's fine... I was just about to head to your place."
Female-Speaker: "My place... at the church? Did you have some business there?"
Female-Speaker: "Ah, just wait here a moment."
The manager retreated into the back.
While waiting, I decided to look around at the photos on display.
There were various photos displayed, from old ones to recent ones.
The years they were taken, the places, and the people were all different.
But there was one thing they all had in common.
That was that everyone was smiling.
I couldn't help but envy the people in those smiling photos.
Female-Speaker: "Well, well, sorry to keep you waiting. Here, this is for you."
The manager held out a photo to me.
In it were Shiona smiling and me with an expressionless face.
Female-Speaker: "It's a photo I took before. It took a while to develop. I apologize for the delay."
Female-Speaker: "That's not true. Thank you. But, I don't have any money..."
Female-Speaker: "It's fine. It was late, and I wanted to take it, so I did. I'll make it a service."
Female-Speaker: "Thank you very much. I'll give it to Shiona."
Female-Speaker: "Please do. Still, now that I see it like this, you and Shiona's brother really do look alike."
Female-Speaker: "You know about Shiona's brother?"
Female-Speaker: "Ah, of course. Have you ever seen a picture of Shiona and her brother together?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, I have. The one where they're holding a music box, right?"
Female-Speaker: "Ah, that's the one. Actually, I took that picture."
Female-Speaker: "Is that so...? When did her brother leave on his journey?"
Female-Speaker: "I think it was right after I took that photo. He said he was going to spread music all over the world. Shiona was so sad then. She's always smiling like that, but she was crying the whole time back then."
Female-Speaker: "Shiona? I can't believe it..."
Female-Speaker: "...But, you know, she's been smiling a lot more lately. As much as when her brother was here... No, maybe even more."
Female-Speaker: "Is that so? I think she's always smiling, for sure."
Female-Speaker: "I'm sure it's because you're here."
Female-Speaker: "I think it's partly because you look like her brother, but I don't think that's all there is to it."
Female-Speaker: "But I haven't been able to do anything for Shiona."
Female-Speaker: "Doing something for her isn't the only way to make her smile. You can also make her smile just by being near her, by being by her side."
Female-Speaker: "Being by her side... If that's the case, then I'm confident that I can be by Shiona's side more than anyone else."
Female-Speaker: "I can see that too. When Shiona is with you, she seems to be showing a smile from the bottom of her heart."
Those words warmed my heart.
I'm connected to Shiona's smile.
Because I'm here, Shiona is--
Female-Speaker: "It's strange for me to ask, but will you stay close to Shiona forever?"
Female-Speaker: "Of course. I will always, always be by Shiona's side, and I will keep making her smile. That is my greatest wish."
Female-Speaker: "Hahaha, it's like a proposal. It's a shame Shiona isn't here to see this."
Female-Speaker: "A pro...posal...?"
Hearing those words, I felt my face getting hot.
I know the meaning of the word.
It's a word that humans use to swear to spend their lives together.
Was what I said just now the same as that?
Thinking about that, my face gets even hotter.
I turn my back to the manager so she won't notice my agitation.
Female-Speaker: "Well then, I have somewhere to go."
Female-Speaker: "Is that so? Don't lose that photo, okay?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, thank you very much."
I said my thanks over my shoulder and left the photo studio.
The road to the abandoned factory.
I push forward through the reddish-black earth.
The bag filled with tools is a heavy burden.
I could hear the sound of the tools rubbing against each other in the bag hanging from my shoulder.
The wind is strong, and it looks like it's about to rain.
If I go to fix it and end up making more things break, that would defeat the purpose.
I decided to hurry to the abandoned factory before it started raining.
Along the way.
In the distance, I spotted something white flickering.
However, the location was too far away, and there was no way to confirm what that object was.
I still couldn't tell how big it was, but that white object seemed to be slowly approaching me.
I tried to focus my eyes and confirm it.
At that moment, a gust of wind blew.
I involuntarily closed my eyes.
When I opened my eyes again, that white object had disappeared from view.
What in the world was that just now...?
For a while, I stood there, frozen in place.
But, I can't stay like this.
The weather is getting more and more suspicious.
I have to get to the abandoned factory quickly.
Just as the dark clouds made it look like it was about to rain, I arrived at the abandoned factory.
The inside is still full of dust and filled with the smell of oxidized oil.
Immediately finding a nearby workbench, I decided to remove the glove on my right hand.
I'm already used to the exposed parts.
First, I'll try slowly opening and closing my fingers.
The malfunction wasn't fixed, and the movement stopped midway.
What could be the cause?
I take out a light from my bag and shine it on my arm, peering inside.
It doesn't seem like there's any foreign object stuck in there.
...In that case, it must be a problem with the internal parts themselves.
I take out my tools and begin disassembling my right hand.
I felt a sense of unease at disassembling my own hand.
I am now destroying myself.
If I were to disassemble all of this, would I break down?
Would that be my 'death'?
I wonder, what kind of feeling would that be?
If I were to die, where would this consciousness disappear to?
And if I were to be reassembled again, would this consciousness return?
Could that be called being alive?
While thinking about such things in the back of my mind as I disassemble, I arrive at the cause of the malfunction.
The piston rod of the cylinder that distributes oil to the fingers was bent, and oil was seeping out.
It's a part that I removed once when I fixed Shiona's music box.
Female-Speaker: At that time, I used the oil inside the cylinder to help the gears of the music box mesh together.
It was only a small amount of oil, but it must have been a necessary amount for the intricate movements of the prosthetic finger.
So, even small tears can become big wounds if they accumulate.
However, if the rod is bent this far, the oil leak might recur even if I fix it halfway.
The most reliable thing to do would be to replace this part entirely with a new one.
I stood up and decided to search around.
Phyloid parts that were lying on the floor, still in the process of being made.
If it's here at the Phyloid factory, there's bound to be a part that fits my model lying around.
With my right arm disassembled, I search the factory.
There were many arm, leg, and torso parts scattered around the factory.
The head parts are so elaborate that you might think they're real for a moment if you're not careful.
I search among them for something that fits me.
Looking at my exposed right arm, I confirm the model number of the part I need.
That seems to be the model number of the necessary part.
I search the scattered arm parts for the same model number.
Am I using something that's that rare?
Even after examining all the parts scattered around the factory, there wasn't one with the same model number.
The state of decay of this factory is much more advanced compared to the place where I woke up.
I can tell that this facility was abandoned a long, long time ago.
If that's the case, then it's understandable that the manufacturing dates are different and there aren't any parts with the same model number.
While searching for parts in a panic, I discovered something marked 'AR115'.
Its appearance is almost identical to the part that was embedded in my arm.
However, the piston rod and shaft are a little long.
With this, it seems I can replace it with just a little modification.
I placed the arm with 'AR115' attached on the workbench and began disassembling it.
After successfully removing the part, I compared it with the part that was originally embedded in me—'HR114'.
It seems that 'AR115' has an additional output terminal that didn't exist on 'HR114'.
There are no other changes besides that.
I immediately tried attaching that part to my arm.
Unlike when disassembling, the installation work was a little difficult.
While dropping the screws many times, I somehow managed to finish the installation.
When I moved my fingers, I was able to open and close them as before.
However, each time, a dissonant sound of the machines rubbing against each other echoed around.
It seems the lubricating oil has run out.
Seeking oil, I moved deeper into the factory.
As the smell of oxidized oil became stronger, I came across a dark black drum.
When I opened them, they were all oxidized and unusable.
But in the very back, I found a relatively new drum.
When I opened it, there was a small amount of oil inside that was less oxidized.
I scooped out the oil with the oil storage tank installed inside my arm.
Then, I returned the tank to its original location.
After a while, the oil was automatically extracted, improving the smoothness of the mechanical parts.
When I moved it, I was able to open and close my fingers without any dissonant sounds.
I was able to fix it.
Looking at my smoothly moving fingertips, I felt a sense of clarity spreading deep within my chest.
I put my gloves back on, returned the tools to my bag, and left the factory.
Outside, the wind had become quite strong.
I hope it doesn't rain...
I hurried back to town.
—On the way.
A white object had fallen to the ground.
It fluttered as if being toyed with by the raging wind.
After staring at it for a while, I realized it was a cloak.
With the nth flutter, I could see something wrapped inside.
It had the shape of a person.
Thinking it couldn't be, I hurriedly approached it, knelt down on one knee, and gently lifted the cloak.
There, I saw a young man with severe injuries.
Blood flowing from his wounded arm—I immediately knew he was human.
Female-Speaker: "A-Are you alright!?"
Female-Speaker: "U... u..."
The young man groaned, as if reacting to my voice.
His body was painfully injured, and it didn't seem like he could stand up at all.
At the young man's feet, there were traces as if he had crawled along.
Blood adhered to those traces, telling the story of his hardship.
—I have to help him.
Something akin to a sense of duty seeped from within my chest into my entire body.
Female-Speaker: "Please hang in there, are you alright!"
I threw the bag I had slung over my shoulder onto the ground and helped the young man up.
Perhaps the pain ran through him from shaking his body, as the young man wore an expression of agony and groaned even more intensely.
And then, as if clinging to something, he reached out his hand.
I reflexively extended my right hand, which was already open.
Through the glove, my mechanical hand was grasped.
I messed up—I inwardly regretted it.
But the strength in his hand was so weak that, conversely, I couldn't shake him off.
The young man slowly opened his eyes and looked at me.
Female-Speaker: "Y... you... you..."
Female-Speaker: "A-Are you alright? There's a town nearby. I'll carry you there right away."
Female-Speaker: "T... town..."
With vacant eyes, he muttered as if repeating my words.
And then, as if confirming the hand he was grasping, he traced the glove with his powerless fingers.
I'm sure he's found out.
He probably noticed the hard sensation, different from that of a human, through the glove.
But it doesn't matter.
This isn't a situation where I can worry about such things.
Female-Speaker: "...D-Do you... l-live... in th-that town...?"
Female-Speaker: "T...town... live..."
The young man repeats "town" like a mantra.
Those words are weak, as if they're about to disappear at any moment.
I decided to take the young man back with me.
Maybe now, I can save this person.
I put his arm over my shoulder and dragged the young man along.
My steps were heavy, and it took a considerable amount of time to advance even ten meters.
But I wanted to help this person... I was filled with the desire to save him.
Female-Speaker: "You... how long have you been in... town...?"
The man, who looks like he's about to faint, asks me.
Female-Speaker: "It's only been about a week."
Female-Speaker: "I see... I... see..."
I can feel the young man weakening over my shoulder.
If I don't keep him conscious, he might not come back.
Female-Speaker: "Please hang in there, we'll be in town soon, very soon. It's not that big, but the people in town are all warm."
I desperately talk to the young man.
If I can talk about something that interests him even a little, he shouldn't lose consciousness.
Female-Speaker: "There aren't any doctors, but I have books, so I'm sure I can figure out how to treat your injuries."
Female-Speaker: "...B...books...?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes! I have everything. I'm sure I can look up anything. So please, hang in there."
Female-Speaker: "...E...everything...?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes! Definitely!"
The young man took a long, slow breath and muttered softly.
Female-Speaker: "...Abandon me..."
I didn't understand what he said.
I stopped walking without thinking.
Female-Speaker: "...Leave me... just abandon me here..."
Female-Speaker: "T-There's no way I could do that!"
Female-Speaker: "I... was attacked by humans..."
Female-Speaker: "By humans...?"
Female-Speaker: "I was just... just traveling in search of an ideal... But an ideal is just... a value..."
The young man took another long breath.
Female-Speaker: "Because of differences in values... humans... clash, antagonize, and fight... becoming cruel and... violent beyond measure..."
Female-Speaker: "T-That's not true! Humans are warm, and they can share many things, and support each other!"
Female-Speaker: "Ah, that is indeed the ideal..."
The young man exhaled all the breath he had taken, going limp.
Female-Speaker: "...Um, p-please hang in there! Please hang in there!"
Is he just unconscious, or is it something more...?
Unpleasant thoughts swirl around in my head.
I grit my teeth, look straight ahead, and start walking towards the town.
To save this person, even a second sooner.
Before I knew it, rain started to fall, striking our backs fiercely.
Rainwater is seeping into my gloves, but this is no time to worry about that.
I frantically carried the young man into the church.
Female-Speaker: "Rei, what's wro... wh-who is that! ?"
Shiona greeted me, looking flustered.
Female-Speaker: "This person collapsed on the way! He's seriously injured!"
Female-Speaker: "I understand. Carry him to the back."
Led by Shiona, I carry the young man to a room with a bed.
When I lay him down on the white sheets, the rainwater and blood on his body mix, spreading into a red stain.
There's no sign of the young man regaining consciousness.
Female-Speaker: "Rei, I've brought some water."
I held the cup Shiona handed me to the young man's mouth.
I pour a little water in.
The young man's throat pulsed as he swallowed.
Even so, he doesn't regain consciousness.
Compared to when I first met him, his complexion is considerably paler.
Female-Speaker: "Shiona, I'm going to the library! I'm sure there must be medical books there!"
Shiona started to say something, then bit her lip.
I was concerned about her behavior, but this is a race against time.
I left the room, ignoring Shiona, and rushed out.
And without caring about getting wet in the rain, I ran to the library.
Female-Speaker: "Rei, what's wrong? You're soaking wet."
Perhaps surprised by me rushing in, Tipi looked at me with wide eyes.
Without worrying about my ragged breath, I asked.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi... do you have any medical books here?"
Female-Speaker: "Y-Yes, we do."
Female-Speaker: "Please, can you take me there right away?"
Female-Speaker: "...Okay."
She must have sensed something.
Tipi immediately led me to the place.
Female-Speaker: "Is someone sick?"
Tipi asked, still facing forward, as she led the way.
Female-Speaker: "Yes... they're injured."
Female-Speaker: "Is it you, Rei? Is it Shiona? Or someone else...?"
Female-Speaker: "No, it's someone Tipi doesn't know. So, you don't have to look so sad."
Female-Speaker: "But... but, but..."
Large drops of tears streamed down her cheeks.
Female-Speaker: That young man is someone Tipi doesn't know.
But, even so...
To be able to shed tears for that person, what a kind child Tipi is.
Female-Speaker: "It's okay... it's okay."
I picked Tipi up and gently wrapped her in my arms.
I could feel her hot tears through my clothes.
I could feel a small ache deep in my chest.
Enduring that pain, I rummaged through the medical books.
But no matter how many books we have, we're just amateurs.
We don't even know what the symptoms are, what kind of treatment to give, or which book is correct.
I took as many books as I could carry from the library.
Not caring about the books getting wet, I returned to the church.
When I opened the door, a melody flowed from within.
It was Shiona's singing.
That singing alone was enough to recognize this as a sacred place.
Female-Speaker: "Shiona, how is he?"
Female-Speaker: "No... he hasn't woken up at all. I've done what I can, but..."
I ran to the young man's side.
The bandages wrapped around him must be Shiona's work.
But the young man's face was even paler than before.
I roughly open the medical books.
I flip through the pages, searching for something I can do.
But we were far too reckless.
No matter how wonderful these medical books are, they're ultimately just bundles of paper.
From the start, there was no way amateurs like us could save someone with medicine.
We were too powerless, too insignificant.
Shiona quietly begins to sing.
Unlike usual, it's a quiet melody, like a requiem.
Female-Speaker: "...Hmm...this song..."
The young man opened his eyes to Shiona's song.
But his gaze is empty, as if he's about to disappear at any moment.
Female-Speaker: "Do you know this song?"
Female-Speaker: "Ah, a nostalgic song... I used to sing it often..."
The young man's gaze traces the ceiling, then turns to me and Shiona.
Suddenly, the young man's expression softens.
Female-Speaker: "...Ah, so it was here... the world I was searching for was here..."
Female-Speaker: "What do you mean? The world you were searching for, what is it...?"
Perhaps the young man can no longer hear me, as he doesn't answer my question.
He just continues to speak unilaterally.
Female-Speaker: "...A path to coexistence... a world of harmony..."
Having said that, the young man quietly closed his eyes.
And then he didn't move a muscle.
I felt something spilling out from the depths of my chest.
Female-Speaker: "Hey, Shiona, why won't he open his eyes? Is he sleeping?"
Female-Speaker: "Even the power I had just now is rapidly fading..."
Female-Speaker: "Hey, I wonder why... is he tired, maybe...?"
An indescribable sense of loss hung heavily in the depths of my chest like dark clouds.
Pain ran through me, as if the depths of my chest had been churned up.
Shiona hugged me from behind.
Her warmth allowed me to calm down a little.
Naturally, I placed my hands over Shiona's hands that were wrapped around my chest.
Female-Speaker: "Shiona... I, I..."
Female-Speaker: "Rei... let's hold a funeral for him."
Female-Speaker: "A funeral...?"
Female-Speaker: "It's like a ceremony that's held when someone dies."
Female-Speaker: "When someone dies..."
With those words, I realized.
Female-Speaker: Ah, this person has died.
Female-Speaker: "That's the only way to mourn the dead."
I couldn't move, listening to Shiona's words.
I couldn't process the concept of death that had appeared before my eyes.
Female-Speaker: "Well then, will you help me with the preparations?"
I could only nod briefly.
We began preparing for the funeral.
To mourn this young man, whose name we didn't even know.
As we proceeded with the preparations for the ceremony, there was only one thing that bothered me.
Female-Speaker: I left Tipi, who was crying so much, at the library.
Was Tipi still crying?
Female-Speaker: In that dark library. All alone.
Female-Speaker: "Rei, what's wrong?"
Shiona spoke to me as my hands stopped while decorating the altar.
Female-Speaker: "Yes... there's something I'm a little worried about."
Female-Speaker: "Something you're worried about? What is it? Is it about that man?"
Female-Speaker: "No, it's not that... it's about Tipi."
Female-Speaker: "Tipi-chan? What about Tipi-chan?"
Female-Speaker: "When I went to get the medical books, I told Tipi everything about that person. Then, Tipi started crying... and terribly, I left Tipi at the library."
Female-Speaker: "You turned pale and left her there."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, that's right. So, I was thinking she might still be crying..."
Female-Speaker: "...Yeah, maybe. I'm sure she's crying in the back of the library."
I could easily imagine that scene.
Thinking that, I couldn't stay still.
Female-Speaker: "Shiona, do you mind if I go check on Tipi?"
Shiona gave me a smile that looked a little sad.
Female-Speaker: "There's still a little more to do to prepare for the funeral. So, I'd be happy if you came back soon."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I know. I'll be right back."
Female-Speaker: "...Okay. See you later."
Shiona still gave me a somewhat sad smile.
I finished decorating the altar and headed to the library.
Carrying the medical books I had borrowed.
I walked through the town, where the rain had lessened, holding an umbrella.
The town's appearance was somehow different than usual.
As if something important was missing, as if something had been lost...
I ran through the town filled with a sense of loss and hurried to the library.
The inside of the library was enveloped in silence, as if it were blocking out the sound of the rain.
--No, except for one thing.
Except for the sound of a blue-haired girl sobbing from the back.
I followed the sound of the girl's crying and moved forward.
The girl was in her usual spot.
The girl was shedding tears while drawing, as usual.
Female-Speaker: "Rei... Rei..."
When Tipi noticed me, she reached out her small hands.
As if in response, I embraced her small body.
The moment I hugged her, her sobs grew a little louder.
Female-Speaker: "Rei... what happened to that person?"
I was choked by those words.
Female-Speaker: "Hey, Rei... Rei..."
Female-Speaker: "That person... hey... hey, hey..."
My silence had become the answer.
Perhaps Tipi understood everything, she began to cry loudly without holding back her sadness.
For that young man she had never met, large tears spilled down her face.
Female-Speaker: Ah, I wonder why.
What is this pain in my chest?
The depths of my chest are being churned up.
It occasionally hurt my chest with pain.
Surely it's something overflowing from the wound opened in my chest.
That heat is overflowing from my eyes.
Before I knew it, I was crying.
I was shedding tears for the death of a young man I didn't even know.
Female-Speaker: Ah, I see.
This is 'sadness'.
This is a blue emotion.
This is the emotion that Tipi always carries in her heart.
It's such a painful and difficult thing.
Tears flow endlessly.
I don't know how to stop them.
--No, that's not right.
I didn't want to stop them.
Female-Speaker: I wanted to keep letting these overflowing hot drops flow.
Surely these drops are an act of healing sadness.
By letting the sadness accumulated in our hearts flow, we are maintaining our hearts.
Thinking that, I felt that the weight accumulated in my heart had become a little lighter.
And at the same time, I also felt that the amount of overflowing tears had increased.
I cried.
We cried.
Sobbing, embracing each other, we cried.
Crying, crying, crying...
No matter how long it took, the tears never dried up.
As if sadness would never wither, the tears continued to overflow.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi, there's a funeral soon."
Female-Speaker: "...A funeral? What... is that?"
Female-Speaker: "It's a ceremony to say goodbye to someone who has died. Shiona is preparing for it now."
Female-Speaker: "Goodbye...? What's 'goodbye'...?"
Female-Speaker: "It means you won't be able to see them anymore."
Female-Speaker: "Can't see them anymore... No!"
Tipi clung tightly to me.
Her arms were trembling slightly.
Female-Speaker: "I understand how you feel, Tipi. But you know, that's precisely why we have to say a proper goodbye, I think."
Female-Speaker: "Because we can't see them anymore, let's say goodbye and see them off. Otherwise, I'm sure we'll be lonely and sad..."
Female-Speaker: "Lonely... sad..."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I'm sure that's how it will be. That's why we'll send them off. So we don't become lonely and sad... Can you do that?"
Tipi slowly pulled away from me.
With a face still wet with tears, she looked up at me.
Female-Speaker: "...I can. Tipi can do it."
Female-Speaker: "I see. That's great, Tipi."
When I stroked her head, she looked a little happy.
But those tears never stopped falling.
Female-Speaker: "Well then, shall we go...? Can you stand?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah... Just a minute."
Tipi stood up and picked up her teddy bear.
Her constant companion, the teddy bear, is still in her arms.
We held hands and headed to the church in the rain.
Female-Speaker: "Merciful God, our Father, we entrust to Your hands this young man who believed in Your only begotten Son and completed his life's journey in the hope of eternal life."
Female-Speaker: "Take away all the burdens of this brother and sister who are leaving us, lead them to the dwelling prepared in heaven, and add them to the assembly of saints."
Female-Speaker: "May we, who are in the sorrow of separation, also be supported by the hope of the resurrection promised by the Lord, and share eternal joy with the child called to You."
Shiona's voice echoed through the church, which was overflowing with attendees.
No one here should have ever seen that young man.
No one here should have ever known that young man.
Even so, everyone gathered here was mourning the young man's death.
I thought, this is the feeling of caring for others, the connection between people.
Everyone clasped their hands in front of their chests, quietly closed their eyes, and offered a prayer.
Tipi and I followed suit.
Shiona's voice solemnly echoed inside the church.
It sounded as if it was a song she was dedicating to the young man…
After the funeral, the young man was buried in the cemetery behind the church.
For one last farewell, the townspeople approached the coffin one by one, offering words of parting.
May you have a good next life…
Let's meet again someday…
Eternal rest…
They spoke their heartfelt words.
Female-Speaker: "Come on, Tipi."
It was our turn, and we approached the coffin.
Tipi stared intently at the coffin containing the young man.
The tears she had been shedding right up until the funeral were gone, and she was just staring at the young man expressionlessly.
As if she had lost all emotion.
Just silently.
Staring intently, intently at the coffin.
Feeling uneasy at her appearance, I tried to call out to Tipi.
But, a moment before I could, she opened her mouth.
She muttered in a small voice.
Several hours passed since then.
Light rarely shone through the gaps in the clouds after the rain, but it was doing so now.
It was rare for sunlight to shine through the gray, cloudy sky.
But I wasn't captivated by the beautiful scenery.
Because I was concerned about Tipi's expression during the funeral.
Female-Speaker: That expression that was too empty to be called sadness.
I don't know what that means.
Even so, there's only one thing I think.
I want to be by her side.
I want to be by Tipi's side and talk to her.
And, I want to heal that sadness for her.
That feeling grew within me.
Just as I was about to open the door to the room, Shiona called out to me.
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I was thinking of going to see Tipi."
Female-Speaker: "At the funeral, Tipi looked so sad, I got worried."
Female-Speaker: "I see... But you know, I'm worried about you, Rei."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah. Because you have such a sad expression, Rei."
Female-Speaker: "Sad... ?"
I touched my cheek with my hand.
Female-Speaker: "You wouldn't know it that way, would you? Here, come over here."
I was led by the hand to the living room and made to stand in front of a mirror.
Female-Speaker: "See? You have a sad look on your face, don't you?"
My face reflected in the mirror was... pale.
I understand well the meaning of what Shiona always said about Tipi being "pale."
Right now, I have the same face as Tipi.
My heart is quiet, but strength is leaving my body, and my expression is sinking as if pulled down by gravity.
Female-Speaker: "...Yeah, it's the first time I've seen my own face like this."
This is... sadness.
Even without shedding tears, when you're captured by this emotion, your expression becomes so "pale."
Female-Speaker: "Someone died. It's only natural to have that kind of face."
What is this feeling... how is it necessary for living...?
It's bitter... painful... heavy, aching, and cold...
I look at Shiona's expression reflected in the mirror.
But she wore a somewhat sad, ephemeral smile.
I'm sure she's forcing herself to smile bravely.
Just thinking about that made the depths of my chest ache.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi-chan is important too. But you know, I want you to cherish yourself first."
Female-Speaker: "Me... cherish myself?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, that's right. Rei cherishing Rei himself."
Female-Speaker: "Cherishing myself... I've never thought about it before."
Female-Speaker: "Rei, you're kind, aren't you? That's why I'm sure you prioritize others over yourself."
Female-Speaker: "But that's what I want to do."
Female-Speaker: "I'm a little sad about that. I don't want you to push yourself too hard, Rei."
Female-Speaker: "I'm not pushing myself."
Female-Speaker: "Is that so? I can't think that way."
Shiona's arms intertwined with mine.
Female-Speaker: "...I'm worried, you know."
I felt my heart rate increasing.
I don't know what it is.
But it was certainly stirring my emotions.
I felt kindness in that warmth.
...No, more than kindness... I feel a different kind of warmth, different from what I feel on my skin.
Female-Speaker: "Hey Rei, how about some tea?"
Female-Speaker: "...Tea? Why?"
Female-Speaker: "When you drink something warm and fluffy, your heart feels fluffy too. Your mind and body can relax, and it feels really good."
Female-Speaker: "But Tipi..."
Female-Speaker: "Tipi-chan is probably shaken by the death. But you know, I'm sure she can overcome it. For that, let's leave her alone for a little while. Being alone is very important, you know?"
Female-Speaker: "Do you think so?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, I'm sure of it. Because you can't become strong if you don't."
Female-Speaker: "People can become stronger by overcoming walls and sorrows. But if someone helps them every time, they can't grow very easily. Let's leave Tipi-chan alone today so she can grow, okay?"
Tipi is a weak person.
She's always crying.
But, if it's a chance for her to grow...
I'll accept it.
Female-Speaker: "Shiona, will you make some tea for me?"
Female-Speaker: "Of course. Will you sit in a chair and wait?"
I sat on the sofa and waited for Shiona's tea.
After waiting for a while, a nice aroma filled the room.
Female-Speaker: "Sorry to keep you waiting. It's a special, heartwarming tea. Enjoy."
The offered teacup was filled with an orange-colored drink.
A faint sourness and a subtle sweet aroma waft through the air.
Female-Speaker: "Like this. It's been a while since I've had a chance to talk with you slowly, Rei."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, it has. So much has happened..."
Female-Speaker: "Rei, how's your memory coming along?"
Female-Speaker: "No, it doesn't seem like it's coming back yet."
Female-Speaker: "I see... But, there's no need to rush. You might suddenly remember something one of these days."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, thank you... But you know, I feel bad about it."
Female-Speaker: "Feel bad? About what?"
Female-Speaker: "I'm staying here as a freeloader, but I haven't been able to repay you at all, Shiona."
Female-Speaker: "That's not true. I'm happy just having you by my side, Rei."
Female-Speaker: "But that's not repaying you at all."
Female-Speaker: "It's not just that. You fixed the music box too... Thanks to that, I was able to sing."
Female-Speaker: "But you were singing even before that, Shiona."
Female-Speaker: "But you know, it's very different with and without a melody. Remember when we performed together in the plaza? Actually, I sang in that place many times before."
Female-Speaker: "In that place... alone?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah. But you know, no one would lend an ear at that time."
Female-Speaker: "With such a wonderful singing voice? That's strange."
Female-Speaker: "Hehe, thank you. But you know, that's just how it is. That's why I was so happy when you brought the music box with you."
Female-Speaker: "That... I was just turning the music box."
Female-Speaker: "That makes me happy. Having you next to me, together, is what makes me happiest of all."
Female-Speaker: "I feel the same way. I'm happy to be with you, Shiona."
Female-Speaker: "...Hehe. Thank you. Rei, you've become so much more emotional."
Female-Speaker: "Emotional? Me?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes. Your expressions are much richer than when we first met."
That was what I sought and desired.
It was what I had been longing for ever since I woke up.
My heart fills up as Shiona tells me this.
The incomplete me is getting closer to being human... to Shiona, because she told me so.
Female-Speaker: "I'm sure it's because you've been smiling next to me, Shiona."
Female-Speaker: "Do you think so? I haven't done anything."
Female-Speaker: "No, it's because you're here, Shiona. Thank you, I'm grateful."
Female-Speaker: "If you're going to say that, then so am I. Rei, thank you."
Female-Speaker: "I'm more thankful."
Female-Speaker: "I'm more... Hehe, this is funny. Us thanking each other over and over."
Female-Speaker: "You're right. What are we even doing?"
Female-Speaker: "...But you know, it's strange."
Female-Speaker: "What's strange?"
Female-Speaker: "I'm thinking that I wish this time could last forever... That's strange, isn't it?"
Female-Speaker: "...No, not at all. I was thinking the same thing..."
Female-Speaker: "...Can I come over there?"
Shiona sits next to me.
A distance where warmth is conveyed.
We were closer than ever before.
Female-Speaker: "Huh...? What is it...?"
Female-Speaker: "What's wrong?"
Female-Speaker: "Somehow, my body feels strange. My chest... it's pounding."
Could it be that she's broken down? It would be troubling if it were a major breakdown requiring maintenance.
Female-Speaker: "It's okay. I'm the same way. My chest has been pounding the whole time."
Female-Speaker: "Huh? A-Are you okay? Does it hurt?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah. This is a very wonderful thing."
Shiona gently smiles shyly and places her hand on mine.
Softly, as if enveloping it.
I responded to that by turning my wrist. As if to put our palms together... so that our fingers could intertwine.
I feel Shiona's warmth even more strongly.
And that warmth warms the depths of my heart.
Female-Speaker: "The depths of my heart are warm, like, gently..."
Female-Speaker: "Your heart...? Here...?"
Shiona's hand reaches towards my chest.
The place she touched instantly became hot.
Female-Speaker: "Shiona's hand feels so hot... I wonder why. Could it be a disease?"
Female-Speaker: "No, that's not true."
Female-Speaker: "Do you know the cause, Shiona?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, probably."
Female-Speaker: "Tell me."
Female-Speaker: "Hehe, what should I do?"
Female-Speaker: "Don't be mean. I'm curious."
Female-Speaker: "Hmm... but you know, it's not just you, Rei."
Female-Speaker: "You mean, getting hot?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, that's right. My heart is also very hot right now."
Female-Speaker: "You feel the same, Shiona?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, the same. Maybe I'm in even worse shape than you are."
Female-Speaker: "That's terrible! How can we cure it?"
Female-Speaker: "No, we can't cure it... We don't have to cure it."
Female-Speaker: "My heart is hot, it's tight, it's painful, it's sad, but it's warm... and that's okay. That's good, Rei."
Shiona's overlapping hand became a little hotter.
I gripped that hand back.
Female-Speaker: "Rei, please."
Female-Speaker: "I want you to stay with me forever."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah... will you stay with me forever and ever?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah... I promise."
Female-Speaker: "Thank you, Rei. I'm so happy... so, so..."
Shiona rested her head on my chest.
I felt my heart filling up because of that.
It's similar to the emotion I felt before called joy, but it's an even stronger emotion.
What do humans call this?
I wanted to ask Shiona, but I thought it would be insensitive to break this atmosphere.
So, just like this... I'll entrust myself and Shiona to time.
The sweet-smelling tea prepared on the table. We stayed like that until the steam disappeared.
The next day, I was getting ready to go out after finishing breakfast.
Shiona, who was washing the dishes, called out to me.
Female-Speaker: "I was thinking of going to the library."
Female-Speaker: "The library... are you going to see Tipi?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, that's the plan."
Female-Speaker: "I'm sure Tipi is still in the process of getting over it. So, shouldn't we leave her alone?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah... but if I think about her being lonely all alone, unable to overcome it, I can't just leave her alone."
Just like Shiona was by my side yesterday and made me feel warm, I think I can support her just by being nearby.
Female-Speaker: "It's okay. Tipi isn't that weak."
Female-Speaker: "Do you think so...?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I'm sure of it. More importantly, Rei, I have a favor to ask. Won't you go to the plaza today?"
Female-Speaker: "To the plaza? Why?"
Female-Speaker: "I'll bring the music box... I was thinking we could sing again."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, something sad happened, didn't it? So, it's important to rest your heart."
Female-Speaker: "Rest your heart...?"
Female-Speaker: "We had a funeral, and I think everyone in town is feeling down too. So, don't you want to brighten everyone's spirits?"
Female-Speaker: "...Everyone in town? Of course, I do."
It's painful to see sad faces.
If I could, I would like to heal that sadness.
Female-Speaker: "Our melody is what can do that. I'm sure it will help the town regain its energy."
Female-Speaker: "I see... do you think so?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I'm sure of it. Come on, let's get ready."
Urged by Shiona, I reach for the music box.
The music box, which I maintain every day, is always ready to play music.
We set off for the plaza.
A cloudy afternoon.
There were hardly any people there.
Female-Speaker: "There's no one here, Shiona."
Female-Speaker: "It's always like this at this time. Before you came, Rei."
Female-Speaker: "Before I came...?"
Female-Speaker: "I told you, didn't I? Ever since you started playing music, everyone has started listening to my songs. The people in town are gradually changing. They're going out more, and interacting more. I feel like the connections between people are gradually getting stronger."
Female-Speaker: "Is it... because I came?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, I think so. Ever since you came, Rei, the people in town have been changing. In a good way, of course."
That was a very happy thing to hear.
I am being helpful to someone.
That fact makes my joy unstoppable.
Female-Speaker: "Rei, you look happy."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah. Your cheeks are relaxed."
Female-Speaker: "My cheeks?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, look--"
Shiona's fingertip touches my cheek.
Just that alone made me feel the warmth deep in my heart again.
Female-Speaker: "Your face feels kind of hot."
Female-Speaker: "Rei, are you blushing? Ahaha."
My face gets even hotter.
It seems what Shiona is saying is right on the mark.
Female-Speaker: "Well then, Rei, shall we begin?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, is everything ready?"
Female-Speaker: "Whenever you're ready."
Shiona slowly closes her eyes.
I felt like I wanted to keep looking at that beautiful profile forever.
But just as much, I also want to hear Shiona's singing voice.
So, I slowly started turning the handle of the music box.
Shiona's singing voice joined the melody.
The two melodies intertwined, and beautiful tones echoed around us.
Soon, people began to gather.
At first, the people had slightly gloomy faces, but gradually they began to smile again.
And before we knew it, a large circle of smiles had spread across the plaza.
Town Child A
Town Person A
Town Person B
Town Person C
Town Person D
The smiles and words of various people are flying around.
Female-Speaker: Ah, this is it.
This is what I was looking for.
People with happy smiles.
Each time I see those smiles, my joy increases.
I was saddened that that girl wasn't in that circle.
The blue-haired girl who is in the back of the library.
The girl who will never visit here.
Female-Speaker: That girl who remains shut up in that library.
I couldn't stop thinking about that girl.
Shiona's voice brought me back to my senses.
Female-Speaker: "Sorry, I was lost in thought for a bit."
Female-Speaker: "I see... everyone's already gone home, you know."
Looking around, the people who had been in such a large circle were now scattered.
It seemed I had been lost in thought for a very long time.
Female-Speaker: "What were you thinking about?"
Female-Speaker: "Hmm... no... it's nothing..."
Female-Speaker: "Shall I guess? It's about Tipi, isn't it?"
Female-Speaker: My heart was seen through so easily. So I nodded honestly.
Female-Speaker: "...Yeah, it is."
Female-Speaker: "I knew it... are you really that concerned about her?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I'm concerned. Because she's still such a young child."
Female-Speaker: "A young child, huh... I guess so."
Female-Speaker: "Besides, she's always all alone. There's no way she isn't lonely."
Female-Speaker: "But she's always been like that. She's probably used to it."
Female-Speaker: "That's not true."
Female-Speaker: "After all, you said it yourself, Shiona. That the people in town have changed since I came."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, that's true..."
Female-Speaker: "Then I want Tipi to change too. It's not right for her to stay lonely."
I said what Shiona taught me, returning her words.
Hearing those words, Shiona's smile clouded over slightly.
She looked towards the library, pursed her lips for a moment, then turned back to me with a smile.
Female-Speaker: "Rei, shall we go home?"
Female-Speaker: "It's going to rain from noon today. Come on, let's go home... okay? I'll make that fluffy white soup for you."
Taking Shiona's hand, I was half-forced to leave the plaza.
Then, a few hours later.
Shiona called out to me again as I was about to leave the house.
Female-Speaker: "Um, I was thinking I'd like to read a book..."
Female-Speaker: "If it's books you want, there are a few that my brother used to read."
Female-Speaker: "Not those... well, it's a genre of book that I'm sure isn't kept here."
Female-Speaker: "What kind of genre is it?"
Female-Speaker: "Books about machines. I've been interested ever since I fixed Mad's the other day."
Female-Speaker: "I see. I'm happy that you're interested in something, Rei."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, thank you. So, I'm going to go to the library."
Female-Speaker: "Does it have to be today?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, sooner is better. I want to read it as soon as possible."
Female-Speaker: "But it's going to rain soon, you know?"
Female-Speaker: "The weather doesn't matter. I'll go even if it rains."
Female-Speaker: "But the book might get wet, you know?"
Female-Speaker: "It's okay, I'll take a bag with me."
Female-Speaker: "Hmm... then I'll go and borrow it for you."
Female-Speaker: "Huh? No, it's fine, I'll go myself."
Female-Speaker: "No, it's okay. I have some shopping to do anyway, so I'll go while I'm at it."
With that, Shiona went back to her room.
I wonder why.
I feel like Shiona is trying to keep me away from the library.
No, that's not it.
It would probably be more accurate to say Tipi.
I don't know what that means, but it seems like she really doesn't want us to meet.
Shiona says it calmly, but I can feel her feelings.
But, I wonder why?
Female-Speaker: "I'm ready, Rei. What kind of book should I borrow?"
Female-Speaker: "You probably wouldn't understand even if I told you, so I'll go with you."
Female-Speaker: "No, it's okay. You just relax, Rei."
Female-Speaker: "Then... I'd like you to borrow a book about electronic circuits."
Female-Speaker: "Electronic circuits, got it. Well then, I'm off."
Shiona went out.
I waited for a few minutes.
It's probably about time Shiona is out of sight.
I reached for the door leading outside.
...That's strange.
It's not locked.
But the door wouldn't open no matter what.
It was as if it were bolted from the outside.
--Could it be, that's what's happening?
When Shiona left, she locked the kind of lock that can only be locked from the outside, without me noticing.
That's why I can't leave through this door.
--But, why?
--For what purpose?
I returned to the living room, holding my head.
When I glanced at the table, there was a piece of paper that hadn't been there before.
It was a note left by Shiona.
To Rei,
I think you were surprised that it was locked.
Do you remember me telling you that a nearby town was attacked?
So, as a precaution, I'm locking the door.
Please stay home and be good.
I've prepared soup and bread for your meal.
Please warm it up and eat it.
Make sure you don't go outside.
Female-Speaker: I also heard about humans who repeatedly plunder from that deceased young man.
Maybe those humans are coming near here.
If that's the case, it's dangerous to go outside.
I see. Shiona was worried about me.
But, if that's the case, it would be dangerous for Shiona to go outside too.
Shouldn't I, as a man, have gone shopping instead?
--Don't try to deceive yourself....
It's certainly true that there are humans who plunder.
Even so, is it necessary to lock the door from the outside?
Rather, if it's locked from the outside, then the key to open it is also on the outside.
Entry into the house becomes easier.
--That's strange.
If she was really wary of humans who plunder, she wouldn't have sung in the plaza yesterday.
She wouldn't do something that would intentionally gather people.
If that's the case, then why?
--There's only one thing I can think of.
She locked me in.
To keep me away from Tipi.
There's no way Shiona would do something like this without thinking.
There must be a reason.
And it must be something she's doing for me.
...Could it be that something happened to Tipi?
Is she trying to keep me from finding out about it?
Something that's not good for me... so I won't be sad knowing about it...
I couldn't stand still.
I want to see Tipi. I want to confirm it.
A blue-haired girl, crying alone in the library.
I wanted to wipe away that girl's tears.
I looked around inside the church.
There was a window in a considerably high position.
Even if I could climb up, there's no guarantee I could get out and down safely.
But, that's the only way to get out of here.
Suddenly, a white cloth caught my eye.
A curtain swaying in the wind.
There were several of them in the room, and they seemed long, large, and sturdy enough to cover the large windows.
I removed the curtains from all the windows.
There was no sign of sunlight pouring down from the sky, which was covered in dark clouds.
When I tied the five curtains together on the table, they became quite long.
It's long enough to reach down to the first floor.
I tied the end of the curtain to the window lattice.
I wrapped it around many times and checked the strength repeatedly.
It's okay.
It should be able to support my weight alone.
I tied the other end of the curtain to myself.
And, steeling myself, I leaned out of the window.
The ground visible from there looked very far away.
I felt a little faint, but I couldn't back out now.
Gripping the curtain tightly, I slowly lowered my body.
Partway down, a strong gust of wind shook me.
As my body swung like a pendulum, I did my best to cling to the curtain.
I waited several minutes for the wind to die down.
I took one big, deep breath and resumed lowering my body.
It probably took about ten minutes for my feet to finally reach the ground.
My body was so exhausted that I almost collapsed onto the ground.
But, I don't have time to rest here.
I started walking towards the library where the blue-haired girl is waiting.
As if to obstruct my thoughts, rain quietly began to fall.
As if to moisten the parched town, its intensity gradually increased.
Not caring about getting wet, I, who didn't have an umbrella, continued to walk forward.
The wet clothes stuck to my bare skin, making me feel uncomfortable.
I sheltered my right hand, covered with a glove, from the rain.
Puddles began to form under my feet, and distant thunder could be heard.
My rough breaths occasionally carried rainwater into my mouth.
Contrary to my body, which was getting hot, cold rain lashed at me from the outside.
Spitting out the rusty-tasting rain, I finally arrived.
At the library where the blue-haired girl was waiting alone.
The inside was dimly lit, and no light leaked out at all.
Is that child buried alone in that dark sea of books again?
Just thinking about it made my chest ache terribly.
I entered the entrance and proceeded deep inside, where the blue-haired girl was waiting.
Female-Speaker: "You came after all..."
A voice came from the back.
It wasn't Tipi's.
It was the very person who was keeping me away from here--.
Female-Speaker: "I wrote in the note that it's dangerous outside, so you shouldn't go out, right? Maybe, you didn't see it?"
Female-Speaker: "No, I saw it."
Female-Speaker: "I see... So you knew and came anyway. Rei is a bad boy."
Shiona's laughter could be heard, a soft 'fufu'.
But her expression wasn't clearly visible in the dimly lit hall.
Female-Speaker: "Why did you lock me up?"
Female-Speaker: "Locked you up...? Well, I guess that's how it turned out. I'm sorry."
Female-Speaker: "You must have a reason, right? Would you mind telling me if you're okay with it?"
Female-Speaker: "...A reason? The reason is simple. I don't want you to see her."
Female-Speaker: "You don't want me to see her...?"
Female-Speaker: "The blue-haired girl who's ahead."
Female-Speaker: "Tipi? Why?"
Female-Speaker: "I can't tell you that. It's top secret."
Female-Speaker: "Wait, I don't understand what you're saying. Why can't I see Tipi?"
Female-Speaker: "That's... because it's not allowed."
Female-Speaker: "That's not a reason! Tell me properly!"
Female-Speaker: "I can't tell you the reason."
Before I knew it, my tone had become harsh.
At the same time, I noticed that the inside of my chest was burning red and hot.
Could this be "anger?"
Am I feeling anger towards Shiona...?
I don't mean to. I just want her to tell me the truth.
But my words just now seemed to have upset Shiona.
I couldn't see her expression clearly in the darkness, but the atmosphere coming from her changed.
An air of hesitation, as if she was struggling to say something.
Shiona opened her mouth slightly, as if to say something... but then closed it again.
And, tilting her chin down as if to look down, she whispered the words.
Female-Speaker: "...Because it will lead to unhappiness."
Female-Speaker: "Unhappiness? Who?"
Female-Speaker: "...Rei, me... and probably everyone living in this town."
Female-Speaker: "The people in town? Because we meet? I don't understand what you're saying."
Female-Speaker: "Certainly, you might not understand now. But you'll definitely regret it later."
Female-Speaker: "Why would I regret it? Hey, Shiona, tell me clearly. I'm not very smart, so I don't understand. Unless you tell me clearly..."
Female-Speaker: "In other words, it's like this..."
The sound of boots.
In the dimly lit entrance, Shiona approached me.
The next thing I felt was warmth.
And, softness.
Shiona was hugging me.
Female-Speaker: "Shiona... eh? W-what..."
Female-Speaker: "Please, Rei... won't you just go home with me like this?"
Female-Speaker: "Like this...? What do you mean?"
Female-Speaker: "It's really not good for Rei and Tipi-chan to meet. To be precise, if you meet, a chain of bad things will happen. That's why..."
Female-Speaker: "Could it be that I made Tipi angry? Is that why she doesn't want to see me, or something like that?"
Female-Speaker: "No, it's the opposite. Tipi-chan loves Rei very much."
Female-Speaker: "If that's the case--"
Female-Speaker: "That's why, you can't see her. Please, understand."
The arms Shiona had wrapped around my waist tightened.
A sweet fragrance enveloped my entire body, making my head spin.
Female-Speaker: "...Is that, Shiona's wish?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, it is. It's my heartfelt wish."
Female-Speaker: "If I were to meet Tipi, what would Shiona think?"
Female-Speaker: "I would be very, very sad. I think I would feel blue and prickly."
Female-Speaker: "Why? Why does Shiona feel that way?"
Shiona pulled her face away from me and looked up at me with upturned eyes...
She said as if she had made up her mind.
Female-Speaker: "Rei... because I love you."
Female-Speaker: "L-love...?"
Those words almost made my mind grind to a halt.
Sweet breath.
Lips that seemed about to touch.
A hand around my waist.
Touching body heat.
We were as close as we could possibly be.
And, those words just now.
It was just a word made up of only two characters, but it contained very deep emotions.
These words filled my chest with tremendous force.
I was feeling an unprecedented level of "joy."
To be needed by someone. To have a certain level of emotion poured into me by a specific someone.
I don't know any greater joy than this.
And now, I am about to obtain that joy.
I put my limp arms around Shiona's back.
Shiona accepts it.
The warmth deep inside my chest increases.
Female-Speaker: "Shiona, I..."
Female-Speaker: "Yes, Rei. I understand. So let's go home, to our house..."
Shiona's hand is linked with mine.
I turned on my heel and started walking towards the library exit.
Female-Speaker: "...Thank you, Rei. But you know, this is for the best. This is for your sake."
I felt a sense of discomfort at Shiona's words.
Shiona called out to me with a puzzled look, as I suddenly stopped walking.
Female-Speaker: "Shiona, you said just now, 'for my sake,' right?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, I certainly did say that."
Female-Speaker: "That's not right, Shiona."
Female-Speaker: "Not right? What's not right, Rei?"
Female-Speaker: "If you're saying it's for my sake, then this isn't right."
Female-Speaker: "It's not wrong. Doing this is for Rei's sake."
Female-Speaker: "It is wrong. Because, I'm happy when I can be useful to someone. I'm here to be useful to someone. But now, I'm trying to disappear from the person I can be useful to. That's not my joy, and it's not for my sake. So, who is this for, then?"
Female-Speaker: "Shiona, I'm going to go to Tipi's side. It's not for anyone else, it's for myself. If someone becomes unhappy because of this, then it's my fault. But, even if that's what happens, I won't stop. Because that's the result I wanted."
I released Shiona's hand, and I once again pushed forward through the entrance.
Shiona's voice didn't reach my back.
Shiona just quietly, without saying anything, watched me with a sad expression.
I passed through the rain-scented entrance and moved deeper into the library.
I could feel the moisture from the soles of my shoes being absorbed into the carpet with each step.
The dry air of the library clung to my damp skin.
This unpleasant feeling continued.
It was probably also related to what happened with Shiona, whom I had just parted ways with.
The depths of my chest ached, as if I had swallowed something heavy.
Shiona's face passed through my mind many times.
Every single one of them, wearing a sad smile.
Why did things turn out like this?
Why did I do such a thing?
A wave of regret washed over me.
But, I couldn't stop my feet.
--Beyond this, that girl is waiting.
A girl who is always alone.
A girl who is always blue.
A girl who is always shedding tears.
I couldn't bring myself to leave that girl alone.
That's why I'm walking down this hallway.
Paintings were hung on the walls of the hallway.
These are the paintings that Tipi draws one of each day.
In the paintings drawn on brand new paper, a single girl was depicted.
I immediately knew who that girl was.
A girl drawn small and alone in the large paper.
Tears streamed down her cheeks.
All of the recent paintings had the same composition.
A painting of a solitary girl crying.
Seeing that painting, my chest ached terribly.
The girl had been alone all this time.
I felt like I understood that sadness.
I wanted to quickly wipe away that sadness.
I wanted to tell you that you're not alone.
I wanted to tell you that I'm by your side.
Dragging my wet soles, I proceeded down the long hallway.
As I gazed at the paintings hung at a height Tipi could reach, I continued forward.
At that moment, I suddenly felt a sense of discomfort.
It wasn't because of the content of the paintings.
The problem was the number of paintings.
No matter how you look at it, Tipi is a very young girl.
Even if that child drew a picture every day, could she really draw this many?
...Perhaps there were days when she drew several pictures in a day.
Even so, the number of these paintings is impossible.
Just how lonely was that girl?
Did she have nothing else to do but draw pictures?
Female-Speaker: Ah, why did I leave that girl alone?
How many tears have I caused her to shed because of that?
The amount of tears in the girl in the paintings increased with each passing day.
It seemed to represent the way the girl's sadness was deepening.
I hurried.
To the side of the girl who was probably crying alone, deep inside here.
In order to heal that sadness.
And in order to wipe away those tears.
The girl. To hold her body in these two hands.
I walked as quickly as I could, to the deepest part of the library, until I was out of breath.
The girl wasn't there, in the place she should always be.
The bear plushie that she's always with, never letting it leave her side, wasn't there either.
Female-Speaker: All that was there was a half-finished drawing and crayons.
In the half-finished drawing, there was a figure of a girl crying all alone.
--Where could Tipi have gone?
I searched the surrounding bookshelves, but I couldn't find her.
Could she be somewhere in this library?
Or perhaps, outside this library?
I don't know the truth.
I won't know until I try to find Tipi.
I started walking.
Weaving through the bookshelves, I searched for the figure of the blue-haired girl.
The vast library grounds are not suitable for searching for someone.
In addition to that, there's this darkness.
You can't find anything just by looking from the edge of the bookshelf.
I'll have to check step by step, with my own feet.
From the back of the library towards the entrance, I walked between the bookshelves.
Before I knew it, the clothes that should have been wet had begun to dry.
And, it was around the time my hair had completely dried.
I was finally able to find the figure of that girl.
The girl was standing on a large stepladder, arranging the books on the shelf.
The girl is an inhabitant of this library, and also serves as a librarian.
She must be returning the books that the townspeople have returned to their original places.
That is a harsh thing for this small girl to do.
The thousands of bookshelves in this library are stacked to a height that reaches the ceiling, and they are also connected.
I don't even want to think about the total number of books in the collection, it's terrifying.
The girl faces such a large number of books, and manages them like this every day.
All alone, inside this library.
Thinking about that, I couldn't help but feel a tightening in the depths of my chest for some reason.
Tipi, stretching on the stepladder, returning books bigger than her face to the shelf.
After finishing that task and taking a breather, Tipi turned her face towards me.
Female-Speaker: "...Ray! ...W-w-w-w-wah..."
Noticing my presence, Tipi lost her balance on the stepladder.
Female-Speaker: "Careful, Tipi!!"
The stepladder falls over.
Tipi's hand is extended.
Responding to that hand, I extended both of my hands.
--The impact pierces through my chest to my back.
When I realized it, I was holding Tipi in my arms, falling backwards onto the floor.
Female-Speaker: "Ray...you came for me, Ray...!!"
Tipi was nuzzling my chest over and over.
Relieved, I stroked Tipi's head.
Her soft hair welcomed my hand.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi, are you hurt anywhere? Are you injured?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I'm okay. Is Ray hurt anywhere?"
Female-Speaker: "I'm fine. Thank you for your concern."
Female-Speaker: "You saved Tipi... Ray, I love you..."
The small girl's hands gripped my clothes tightly.
I felt a slightly wet and warm sensation on my chest.
Tipi is shedding tears.
But, they seemed like different tears than usual.
Surely they are tears of relief.
Because I'm here, I must be able to lighten Tipi's heart a little.
Thinking that, joy rushes through me.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi was putting the books in order. I'm a good girl, right? Good girl?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, you're a good girl. A very good girl."
Female-Speaker: "Hey, pet me. Because I'm a good girl, pet Tipi's head."
Female-Speaker: "Yes... Tipi is a good girl, a good girl..."
I stroked her silky hair.
Female-Speaker: "Yay... Ray is petting my head. Tipi is so happy..."
Female-Speaker: "Are you always putting the books in order?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah. I'm repairing the books. Because I want lots of different people to read them."
I look up at the bookshelf.
Certainly, some of the books are quite old.
Some have worn spines or are discolored.
Tipi is repairing these...?
I remember wetting the books in the rain.
If I handle them roughly, I'll end up increasing Tipi's workload like this.
I vowed from the bottom of my heart to treat them with care.
I sit up and lean my back against a nearby bookshelf.
Female-Speaker: "I'm sorry I'm late."
Female-Speaker: "It's okay... because you came for me, Ray."
Female-Speaker: "Were you okay all alone?"
Female-Speaker: "No... I was very, very lonely."
Female-Speaker: "Were you crying?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah... yeah, yeah..."
Tipi presses her face against my chest.
Occasionally, I could hear her sobbing.
Female-Speaker: "It's okay, because we'll be together forever now."
Female-Speaker: "Forever? Ray, will you stay with Tipi?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, that's right. I'll try to come to the library as much as possible."
Female-Speaker: "Won't you stay with me?"
Tipi raised her face.
Large tears were pooling in her eyes.
Female-Speaker: "That's a little difficult. I'm currently being taken care of by Shiona."
Female-Speaker: "But, I'll come every day. That should make you less lonely, right?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah... but, the nights are so lonely."
Female-Speaker: "The nights, huh..."
Female-Speaker: "It's dark and quiet... Sometimes Tipi thinks she might be all alone in the world."
Female-Speaker: "That's not true. That's not true..."
All I could do was hug Tipi.
A sweet fragrance emanated from Tipi.
A sweet fragrance different from Shiona's.
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I know... Just you coming here like this makes Tipi happy. Hey, Ray. Can I ask you something?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, what is it, Tipi?"
Female-Speaker: "Will you help me?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah... of course, it's the least I can do."
Standing up, I took Tipi's hand.
Pushing a cart filled with several books, we strolled through the library.
Female-Speaker: "Next... um, a book called 'The Philosophy of Mind and Body'."
Female-Speaker: "In that case, it's shelf Easy 493, third shelf from the top, thirteenth book from the right."
As soon as I said the book's title, Tipi recited its location without missing a beat.
It was as if she knew every single book in this library.
In the exact spot she mentioned, there was indeed a gap for one book.
When I inserted it, it fit perfectly.
Tipi wasn't just saying things randomly.
She was indicating the book's location with certainty.
Intrigued, I decided to ask a slightly mischievous question.
Female-Speaker: "Hey Tipi, can I ask you something?"
Female-Speaker: "Do you remember the opening of this novel?"
What I presented was a rather old novel.
Tipi stared intently at the title, and began to recite it as if opening a book in her mind.
Female-Speaker: "'Below me was a drop of five stories. Cream-colored bricks were laid right next to the school building, creating a walkway that would be pleasant to stroll along. Right next to the walkway was a flower bed, and even from this height, I could see the colorful flowers. If I were to throw myself from here, would the cream color and the flowers all be stained with my dirty blood?'"
Tipi recited it without a single mistake.
It matched the handwritten text in the novel perfectly.
Female-Speaker: "Could it be that you remember all the books here?"
Female-Speaker: "Hmm... I don't know."
Female-Speaker: "Then, what about this book?"
After glancing at the book I presented, Tipi began to recite it fluently.
Female-Speaker: "'The human body is composed of approximately 206 bones, starting from the head with the occipital bone, frontal bone, temporal bone, parietal bone, sphenoid bone, ethmoid bone, malleus, incus, stapes, inferior nasal concha, lacrimal bone, nasal bone, vomer, maxilla, palatine bone, zygomatic bone, mandible, hyoid bone, then connecting to the cervical vertebrae, and extending to the thoracic vertebrae, lumbar vertebrae, sacral vertebrae, coccygeal vertebrae, ribs, and sternum.'"
Female-Speaker: "...Then, what about this one?"
I presented a handwritten book titled 'Complete Book of Pi'.
Female-Speaker: "What's the beginning of this 'Soulless Child Theory'?"
Female-Speaker: "'Everything is finite, and even the soul is no exception. A child born after the soul has withered will be a soulless vessel. - Edward Morgue'"
Tipi has memorized all the books here.
But, why is that?
Even with tremendous memorization skills, she would first need to read these books.
Even if she kept reading every day, she could never finish reading this sea of books.
What on earth is going on...?
Female-Speaker: "Ray, what's wrong?"
Female-Speaker: "No, it's nothing. Come on, let's put the next book away."
There's no point in thinking about something I can't find an answer to.
For now, I'll focus on helping Tipi with her work.
After returning all the books to the shelves, we sat down in our usual spot.
Female-Speaker: "Ray, thank you for helping me."
Tipi is being more affectionate with me than usual.
Is it a reaction to not being able to see me until now?
The way she snuggles up to me is cute and endearing.
Female-Speaker: "It's okay, Tipi. You're always doing this alone, right?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah... I'm always, always alone. I'm lonely."
Female-Speaker: "...Since when have you been alone?"
That might have been a forbidden question.
Tipi looked up at me sadly.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi has always been alone, for a long time."
And then, Tipi told me her story.
A sad tale of how Tipi came to be alone.
Female-Speaker: "Papa, Mama..."
It was a story from when Tipi's parents were still at the library.
The young girl loved them very much.
She loved her kind mother and father very much.
Her mother was always smiling and would gently hug Tipi.
Her father was always organizing books while gently watching the two of them.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi is as spoiled as ever."
Her father took out an electronic device for books from the desk.
Female-Speaker: "Oops, that's right. Tipi liked this one better, didn't she?"
With a wry smile, he put away the electronic device and took out a "book" made of paper instead.
The technology of printing had already become obsolete, and now it was a precious cultural artifact.
Female-Speaker: "Welcome, Tipi-chan."
Called onto her mother's lap, she happily sat down.
And on Tipi's lap was a bear plushie that her parents had chosen for her.
Tipi enjoyed every day.
She enjoyed the days spent with her beloved mother and father.
And there wasn't a day she didn't feel happy.
Her mother always praised the pictures Tipi drew.
Female-Speaker: "You're sure to be an artist someday. Father, you must be so proud."
Her father always held hope for Tipi's future.
If only those days could continue forever.
If only the three of them could stay together like this forever.
Tipi always thought so.
Before she knew it, the number of days her parents frowned increased.
Tipi didn't like that expression.
The town also seemed restless.
The adults were all talking about something, saying the same things.
But, the young Tipi didn't understand what it meant.
She only had a rising anxiety that their life as it was would be destroyed.
Female-Speaker: One day, the phone rang.
To Tipi, that sound seemed very sad.
Her father, who answered the phone, began to frown.
That expression that Tipi didn't like.
After putting down the phone, her father was talking about something with her mother.
After a while, that talk turned into an argument.
They were arguing about something.
The only thing I understood was that seeing the two of them arguing was very sad.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi-chan, will you listen to me?"
After a while, her mother met Tipi's gaze with a serious expression.
Behind her was her father—and packed luggage.
Tipi intuitively realized that their life as it was would not continue.
Female-Speaker: "Right now, terrible things are happening in the world."
Female-Speaker: "Many people are scared, and they can't sleep at night. Tipi-chan doesn't want that, right?"
Female-Speaker: "There are children all over the world who feel that way. Your mother thinks that if we can, we want to help them."
Female-Speaker: "Yes... I knew Tipi-chan would say that... Now, Tipi-chan, this is the important part. It's okay if you don't understand, but will you listen?"
Female-Speaker: "Actually, your father and mother have to go far away to help those children. Even if we go, we might not be able to change the situation... But, there's a possibility."
Female-Speaker: "No. Much, much farther. It's such a far place that it would take days or weeks to get there."
Her father stopped Tipi as she tried to go to her room.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi doesn't need to pack for the trip."
Female-Speaker: "That's not it... Actually, Tipi, your father and mother are going to that place alone."
Female-Speaker: "Alone...? What about Tipi...?"
Her parents exchanged glances.
Tipi sensed something from her parents' sad faces.
Suddenly, tears began to overflow.
Female-Speaker: "I'm sorry, Tipi-chan, but we can't do that."
Female-Speaker: "The place your mother and father are going is very dangerous. We don't want to take Tipi-chan to such a dangerous place. Because your mother and father care about Tipi-chan."
Female-Speaker: "N-No... No, no, no... Tipi is going too..."
Her parents gently hugged Tipi.
Female-Speaker: "I'm sorry, Tipi-chan... But even so, your mother and father have to go."
Female-Speaker: "I'm sorry, Tipi... It's okay, we'll definitely be back soon."
Female-Speaker: "We'll definitely be right back... So don't be lonely, we'll come back right away..."
Female-Speaker: "Tipi, be a good girl and stay home. And show us Tipi's drawings again."
Female-Speaker: "Oh, that's right. Draw one picture every day. The things Tipi saw, the things Tipi heard, the things Tipi learned, the things Tipi felt. When we come back, won't you tell us about them?"
Female-Speaker: "That's right. I'll also make a lot of stories into books on my trip. I'll come back to tell them to Tipi."
Female-Speaker: "Yes, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. I promise, so..."
The three family members hugged each other.
To heal the parting, which they didn't know how long it would last--.
How much time had passed since then?
Tipi continued to draw, just as her father had told her.
Each time she finished a drawing, she would stick it on the wall. So that her parents would see it as soon as they came home.
The things she saw...
The things she heard...
The things she learned...
The things she felt...
But that was soon filled with thoughts of her parents.
I want them to hug me, to pat my head, to call my name, quickly... I want to see them...
Her heart was dyed blue, a deep blue.
The girl continued to draw, tears streaming down her face...
Tipi told me about her sad past, shedding blue tears of sorrow.
Her small shoulders were trembling faintly.
A girl enduring sadness right before my eyes.
I can't fathom how great her sorrow is.
Probably because I've never felt that much sadness before.
So I can't understand Tipi's feelings.
But I should be able to heal her sadness.
By holding her small body close.
Surely.
Tipi sat with her back against the wall.
I reach out my hand to her delicate body.
When I touch her shoulder, Tipi's body jumped slightly.
It wasn't rejection.
She just seemed a little surprised by the sudden action in the darkness.
Female-Speaker: "It's okay, Tipi. It's okay."
Female-Speaker: "Hey, Ray, you won't disappear from Tipi's side, will you?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I won't disappear."
Female-Speaker: "You won't leave Tipi alone?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I won't leave you alone."
Female-Speaker: "You won't make Tipi lonely?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I won't make you lonely."
Female-Speaker: "You won't make Tipi sad?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I won't make you sad."
Female-Speaker: "You'll cherish Tipi?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I'll cherish you."
Female-Speaker: "You'll hug Tipi?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I'll hug you."
Female-Speaker: "You'll hold Tipi?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I'll hold you."
Female-Speaker: "You'll pat Tipi's head?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I'll pat you."
Female-Speaker: "You'll hold Tipi's hand?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I'll hold your hand."
Female-Speaker: "You'll stay with Tipi forever?"
Tipi's eyes glimmered faintly in the darkness.
The shoulder I touched had a temperature that was almost too hot.
I pulled Tipi's body close to me--.
Female-Speaker: "Oh, how friendly."
The voice that echoed in the darkness didn't belong to the girl who was just trying to heal her sadness.
It was Shiona's, who I should have parted ways with at the entrance.
Before I knew it, Shiona was standing next to me.
With a smile that could be seen even in the dim light, Shiona approached us directly.
Female-Speaker: "But, being too friendly is also a problem, you know? You're a boy and girl of a certain age, after all."
Shiona stopped the hand I had extended towards Tipi.
Female-Speaker: "N-No... N-No..."
Tipi's face, which had been seeking that arm, twisted in sadness.
I couldn't help but raise my voice at Shiona.
Female-Speaker: "Shiona, what are you doing!"
Female-Speaker: "What's wrong? Why are you so agitated? You have to think about physical contact with a child of that age."
Female-Speaker: "That's not it. Tipi is sad... I'm just trying to heal her sadness, even if just a little."
Female-Speaker: "Sad? About what?"
Female-Speaker: "About her parents not coming home yet! Tipi has been all alone this whole time. She's been feeling lonely all along!"
Female-Speaker: "That's reality, so it can't be helped."
Female-Speaker: "Can't be helped? What exactly is that supposed to mean..."
Shiona walked up to Tipi.
And then, she looked at Tipi, who was small and grieving.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi-chan? It's sad, but Tipi-chan will always be all alone, you know? Up until now, and forever into the future."
She said that with a smile, in her usual tone.
Female-Speaker: "Shiona, what are you saying..."
Female-Speaker: "Tipi-chan, you understand too, right? That your mom and dad aren't coming back anymore, right?"
Female-Speaker: "Shiona... stop... stop saying such cruel things..."
Female-Speaker: "You've actually noticed, haven't you? You just don't want to admit it, right?"
Female-Speaker: "...No... no... I don't want to..."
Female-Speaker: "Tipi-chan's mom and dad..."
Female-Speaker: "...Shiona... stop it..."
Female-Speaker: "Are already de──"
Male-Speaker: "Stop it, aaaaaaaah!!"
My voice echoed throughout the library.
My whole body was burning up.
My breathing became ragged, and I felt a pain deep in my head.
My clenched teeth were also grinding and groaning.
My vision flickered, and I could barely stand.
And at the same time, I became certain.
My chest felt red and prickly. The feeling that Mad-san always had.
This is the emotion called 'anger'.
I'm feeling anger at the injustice happening before my eyes.
Now, the blue girl's hope has been severed.
With a heartless word from Shiona, Tipi was hurt.
Tipi is crying with a voiceless voice.
Her face is all scrunched up.
Turning her sadness into large drops, flowing down her cheeks.
With her young body, she desperately narrates her bottomless sorrow.
Shiona added insult to injury.
Female-Speaker: "Because it's true, right? How long do you think it's been since Tipi-chan's mom and dad came home?"
Female-Speaker: "Tipi-chan, you draw pictures every day, right? How many is it now?"
Female-Speaker: "Stop it..."
Female-Speaker: "Doesn't it make you sad drawing them every day? How many more pictures do you have to draw before your mom and dad come back?"
Female-Speaker: "St-Stop it..."
Female-Speaker: "It's useless no matter how much you cry. Tears only flow to comfort yourself. Just because they flow doesn't mean anything will change."
Female-Speaker: "...Please stop..."
Female-Speaker: "That's just self-satisfaction. You're only crying because you know someone will be nice to you if you cry. That's just running away from reality."
Female-Speaker: "...Pl-Please... stop..."
Female-Speaker: "Let's realize it already. Your mom and dad aren't coming back. Never again. Tipi-chan will never be able to see her mom and dad again."
Female-Speaker: "And, let me tell you. Rei is only here because he pities Tipi-chan. He doesn't have the love that your mom and dad poured into you. Only pity is binding Rei here. Do you understand, Tipi-chan? You're all alone."
Female-Speaker: "Stop it----------------"
A resounding roar.
When that voice echoing off the walls stopped, only Tipi's sobs remained.
Tipi looked up at Shiona with hollow eyes.
I felt like the light she had just a little while ago had disappeared.
Female-Speaker: "Rei, spoiling someone and comforting them are two different things."
Female-Speaker: "That's not true... that's not true..."
Female-Speaker: "Rei, you need to accept reality too. Tipi-chan's parents are no longer in this world."
Female-Speaker: "That's wrong... that's not true..."
Female-Speaker: "Then why haven't they contacted her even once? Not even a single letter to Tipi-chan, who they doted on and loved so much?"
Female-Speaker: "That's... surely, they're busy and don't have time to contact her..."
Female-Speaker: "If they knew their child was worried, they wouldn't begrudge that time. Especially if it's their beloved child. The fact that they haven't means--"
Female-Speaker: "Stop it... please stop..."
Female-Speaker: "--Tipi-chan's mom and dad are already dead."
I froze.
Shiona's tone was as gentle as usual, and her smile was the same as always.
I wish she had said it in a cold, emotionless voice.
In that abnormal atmosphere, I couldn't continue speaking.
Shiona's face, as she turned to face Tipi again, was smiling.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi-chan, your family is just your mom and dad. But those two aren't coming back anymore. So no matter who you're with, you'll never be truly fulfilled. Even if Rei is with you, you can't become a family. That's an unchangeable fact now. You'll always be alone."
Shiona turned on her heel and headed towards the entrance.
On the way, she turned back towards me just once.
But she kept her gaze fixed on the floor.
Female-Speaker: "Rei... it's all for your sake."
Shiona left the library, leaving only those words behind.
Silence descended upon the hall.
Now, even Tipi's sobs were gone.
I was furious with Shiona's words and actions, and utterly drained.
I couldn't even stand up.
But I couldn't leave the girl alone like this.
The girl must be thinking.
That she's all alone in the world.
That she has to live in solitude.
I didn't want her to think that way.
I wanted her to know she wasn't alone.
My feelings for Tipi aren't pity.
It's definitely not pity.
I repeated it over and over.
As if telling myself, again and again.
I reached out and placed my hand on Tipi's shoulder.
I pulled her delicate shoulders close to me.
Tipi initially flinched as if surprised, but then settled against my chest.
She's burying her face and stifling her sobs as she cries.
I gently stroked her trembling shoulders again and again.
If only I could alleviate even a little of the sadness she holds in that small body...
I don't know how long we stayed like that.
We sat there, leaning against each other as if to find solace.
After a while, when I lost track of time.
Tipi got up unsteadily and started walking as if searching for something.
Tipi doesn't respond.
It's her sketchbook and crayons.
Tipi comes back to me holding those two things.
She sits down, leaning her back against my stomach.
Tipi still doesn't respond.
Instead, she starts flipping through the pages of her sketchbook.
With a fresh page as her canvas, Tipi picks up a crayon.
And without hesitation, she runs the crayon across the paper.
What's being drawn is a cute, age-appropriate picture.
The first thing she drew was a picture of a blue girl.
There are traces of tears on her cheeks.
Her eyes are tinged with red.
I gently stroked Tipi's head.
Tipi lowered her gaze again and ran the crayon across the paper.
The next thing being drawn seems to be me.
My hand is placed on the girl's head.
It seems to be a scene of me gently stroking her head.
And then--
It was Shiona.
She's watching the girl from a short distance away with a scary face.
That was Shiona as Tipi sees her.
Even from my perspective, Shiona in front of Tipi probably looks like that in the picture.
Why did Shiona do something like that?
Shiona said.
That it was all for my sake.
I don't understand what that means.
No, I didn't want to understand.
I don't understand what it means to make Tipi cry and say it's for my sake.
Can I become happy by making someone else unhappy?
No, there's no way that could happen.
Female-Speaker: It's something that shouldn't happen.
As if to drown out Shiona's words that were stuck in my ears, I hugged Tipi.
Her voice is faint and about to disappear.
But deep down, I felt a hint of joy.
I thought as I looked at the picture.
Could this be Tipi's way of avoiding sadness?
It's said that people dream at the end of the day.
That's said to be in order to organize the memories of the day's events.
For Tipi, perhaps this picture is that.
The events of the day--
Including the good and the bad, she draws everything in pictures.
By doing so, she organizes her memories and calms her heart, doesn't she?
In fact, Tipi's expression has softened somewhat.
As the picture progresses, her sadness eases.
As if she's passing her sadness onto the picture.
Tipi, having stood up, took my hand.
Following her lead, I arrived at a wall covered in pictures.
Pictures that she draws one per day.
The number of pictures was enormous.
Tipi pasted the picture she drew today at the very edge.
Another picture of Tipi's has been added.
The wall full of pictures felt like a diary showing this girl's loneliness.
Tipi must have spent her time alone entirely on this story.
To think she's been keeping such a sad story to herself all this time...
Thinking that, something welled up from the depths of my chest.
Looking into those sorrowful eyes, I unintentionally choked up.
Instead of answering, I embraced Tipi.
After a while, I could hear her quiet breathing.
I compared Tipi, who was sleeping in my arms, with the picture diary on the wall.
Could it be that this picture book is Tipi's heart itself?
I fell asleep while thinking about such things.
It's the church where I live.
I'm standing in front of the familiar white, large doors.
I pushed open those doors with both hands.
The chapel that continues inside is enveloped in surprising silence.
--No, it's not complete silence.
Because the sound of quiet sobbing reached my ears.
I rushed through the chapel.
Then, I came face to face with the person who was sobbing.
It was someone who never stopped smiling.
It was Shiona.
Shiona was crying, her delicate shoulders trembling.
I couldn't hide my surprise at that.
--Why is she crying?
I didn't understand the reason.
But, the fact is that Shiona is crying in front of me.
Those tears are not fake.
Even so, I couldn't do anything.
...No, that's not true.
There should be something I can do.
I reach out my hand.
My fingertips were reaching towards Shiona's eyes.
Stopping those tears doesn't seem possible for me.
But, wiping away the tears that have already fallen, I can do that.
I'm someone who can only do something like that, but--.
I extend my fingertips towards the large droplets.
Midway there, my hand stopped.
My fingertips are made of machine.
The extended index finger has a metallic sheen...
That's right.
I had forgotten.
No, I wanted to forget.
I am not human.
I am a created being.
Why is this happening?
Am I not even allowed to wipe away the tears of someone I care about?
Shiona is crying.
She continues to shed tears.
Could this be a sadness that Shiona has never shown before?
But, I can't stop or wipe away those endlessly flowing tears.
Then, why am I here?
Being here, what can I do for Shiona?
I couldn't find the answer.
I couldn't move my outstretched mechanical hand any further...
--Immediately after, a dissonant sound of metal scraping against metal echoed around me.
The ear-splitting sound echoed intermittently.
Just as I thought that, my outstretched fingertips--
Those parts crumbled and fell to the floor.
The collapse, which started from my fingertips, increased its range to my palm--wrist--arm--shoulder.
Parts from all over my body are falling apart.
Before long, it became difficult for me to even stand there, and I collapsed to the floor.
My legs, my torso, are turning into scrap.
Scrap metal is piling up around me.
I couldn't even make a sound, and had no choice but to accept the destruction.
Shiona is still crying.
She's crying, stifling her voice.
I can't even extend my mechanical hand anymore.
Because there's no longer even an arm or fingertips there.
The collapse corrodes my entire body, reaching even my head.
I don't feel any pain.
I shouldn't feel any.
But...
I felt a pain deep within my chest, a chest that should no longer exist.
The last thing I saw as my vision crumbled away was Shiona's sad expression and tears.
Before long, I was just a pile of metal--.
A mountain of scrap.
--And then, I woke up.
I was shouting something, but I don't remember.
My breathing is ragged.
I hurriedly looked around.
A dimly lit, dusty space.
The lukewarm air clings stickily to me.
And then, the thick books lined up on the shelves.
This was the library.
It seems I fell asleep yesterday and woke up this morning.
I hurriedly took off my gloves and checked my right hand.
The one that should have crumbled just now was still there as always.
But, just like in the dream, it's made of machine.
Before I knew it, Tipi was sleeping soundly on my lap.
Her innocent sleeping face doesn't make me feel the sadness from yesterday.
It seems I was having what humans call a dream.
During sleep mode, I sometimes catch a glimpse of past records in order to organize the memory area.
But what I just saw was probably something like a prediction based on experience and memory.
Does that mean this kind of possibility is hidden in the future... that's what was calculated?
Even so, how sad.
I still couldn't calm the unrest in the depths of my chest.
Why do Shiona's tears shake me up so much?
And why am I so powerless?
I'm not real.
I knew that.
I thought I knew.
But, even so, I want to make them laugh.
I want to make Shiona, Tipi, and everyone in town laugh.
But, I can't do it.
I can guess the answer, but I don't want to admit it.
--It's because I'm a manufactured being.
The one truth I can't resist, no matter what.
But even so, I wished for it.
I want to make everyone around me smile.
And yet, that wish won't come true.
When I try to make Tipi smile, Shiona won't smile for me.
When I try to make Shiona smile, I can't wipe away Tipi's tears.
How difficult this is.
Isn't there a better way to make everyone smile?
While looking at Tipi's sad sleeping face, I repeated it over and over in my heart.
I stroke Tipi's head with my fingertips.
Her smooth hair lets my fingertips pass through to the ends without tangling.
A sweet fragrance spreads.
Female-Speaker: "Ngh... nnn..."
Is she dreaming? Tipi let out a small voice.
Looking at her innocent sleeping face, my desire to protect her grows stronger.
But, how?
Looking back and forth between my mechanical right hand and Tipi's face, I was at a loss.
I was hoping that this gentle time would last forever.
--But, that wasn't to be.
A strange sound echoed from afar.
It was like the sound of many people walking at the exact same time, footsteps echoing.
And then, faintly, the sound of screams and something being destroyed.
Those two sounds crushed even my small hope.
I hurriedly put my glove on my right hand.
Female-Speaker: "W-What... Ray, what is it...?"
Tipi woke up at that abnormality.
An anxious expression that wasn't there until just now spread across Tipi's face.
Female-Speaker: "I don't know... but it seems like something's happened."
Female-Speaker: "Something? What is it?"
Female-Speaker: "I have no idea. But I'm sure it's not a good situation."
I stood up and pointed my toes towards the library aisle.
Female-Speaker: "...Ray? Where are you going?"
Female-Speaker: "I'm just going to check things out a bit."
Female-Speaker: "No... don't go, Ray."
Female-Speaker: "It's okay, I'm not going anywhere. I'm just going to check things out on the roof for a little while."
Female-Speaker: "No... I don't want you to..."
Tipi hugged me and shed tears.
She must be projecting the image of her lost parents onto me.
Female-Speaker: "It's okay. It's okay, Tipi."
Female-Speaker: "N-No... no..."
Female-Speaker: "Have I ever broken a promise with you, Tipi?"
Female-Speaker: "That's right, isn't it? Whenever I said I'd go see you, I always did, right?"
Female-Speaker: "So it's okay. I'll look from the roof and come right back."
Female-Speaker: "...Okay. But, come back quickly, okay?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, of course."
After making a promise with Tipi, I headed to the library rooftop.
What I reached after climbing the long spiral staircase was an old, rusted door.
There was no sign it had been used for a long time.
When I opened it, a grating, unpleasant sound echoed in my ears.
Without minding it, I pushed the door open.
...At the same time as that.
An anomaly jumped into my eyes.
Black smoke was rising from all over town.
The scream-like sounds were not a mishearing; they were coming from the mouths of the townspeople fleeing from something.
And chasing after those townspeople were multiple figures clad in soiled cloaks.
Silently, they simply walked while holding firearms--yet, with efficient coordination, they were surely cornering the fleeing people.
It was as if everything was calculated, such were their movements.
The townspeople cornered against the wall and the attackers are exchanging words.
The attackers exchange glances and nod to each other, then point their guns at the townspeople's heads.
And, without showing even a hint of hesitation, they pull the finger they had on the trigger.
--Along with a dry sound, their heads shake violently as if bursting, and the townspeople collapse on the spot...
The sound snapped me back to reality, and I understood the situation.
It's hard to believe, but... this town seems to be under attack.
What Shiona said was true after all...
I hurriedly returned to the lobby.
Seeing me like that, Tipi anxiously asks.
Female-Speaker: "Ray... did something happen? You have a really scary look on your face."
Female-Speaker: "...I don't really know... but... something bad is happening..."
Unable to tell Tipi what I had just seen, I spoke vaguely.
Female-Speaker: "Something bad? What do you mean?"
Female-Speaker: "I think... this town is being attacked."
Female-Speaker: "No... Tipi's scared..."
Female-Speaker: "It's okay, it's happening far away in town. It should still be safe here, so calm down."
Female-Speaker: "...Okay... but, what are we going to do?"
Female-Speaker: "I'm going to go and confirm what's happening."
I was worried about the town, but I was even more worried about Shiona.
Even though what happened yesterday, she's still a human who helped me.
I haven't even asked why Shiona, who is kind to everyone, is so harsh only to Tipi.
I still don't understand the meaning of her words that it was for my sake.
Female-Speaker: "No, don't go... please... Ray..."
Female-Speaker: "It's okay, Tipi. I'll definitely come back."
Female-Speaker: "Really? Really, really?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, of course. So, can you wait just a little bit for me?"
Female-Speaker: "If you come back, Tipi will wait."
Tipi hugged her bear tightly.
Even so, the anxiety couldn't be erased from her expression.
Is there nothing I can do for this girl's sadness and anxiety?
Leaving with such a guilty feeling in my heart, I left the library.
I decided to use back streets as much as possible on the way to town.
What's happening in town is clearly not good.
There's a risk that I might suffer some damage if I'm found.
I headed to the plaza, suppressing my footsteps as much as possible.
I wanted to arrive before the squadron if possible, but it seemed impossible because I had to repeat detours to proceed.
The closer I got to the center of town, the more broken buildings I noticed.
But those were all buildings that didn't seem like they would break until yesterday.
Female-Speaker: I wonder if those unknown people who were chasing the townspeople destroyed them.
Dusty smoke drifts through the town that was beautiful until yesterday.
Why is it necessary to destroy the buildings in this peaceful town?
I just can't understand it.
Amidst the intensifying screams and the noise of buildings being destroyed, I arrived at the truth.
--At the tragic scene unfolding in the plaza.
Many men were chasing and capturing the townspeople.
Pointing guns, using unreasonable violence as a shield, they drove men, women, and even children without regard.
The captured townspeople were made to sit in the center of the plaza.
Children crying and screaming. Inarticulate shouts of anger.
The armed men, not caring about those voices, had cool faces.
No, the expression "cool faces" might be strange.
They had faces as if they were glancing at a stone lying on the roadside, without any interest.
I can't confirm Shiona's figure within the visible range. I should think that she hasn't been captured yet...?
Female-Speaker: "--The situation?"
Female-Speaker: "--We've captured the majority of the residents. It's only a matter of time for the rest."
Nearby, I overheard two men talking.
So as not to be noticed, I slowly approached the two of them and eavesdropped.
Female-Speaker: "How about the water and food?"
Female-Speaker: "Enough was stored. As for water, an underground water source was found."
Female-Speaker: "I see, so it's become a bigger harvest than expected."
Female-Speaker: "Yes, it's possible to settle here permanently as it is."
I was convinced.
That these men are the humans attacking the town and stealing water and food.
I just couldn't forgive their unreasonable actions.
To hurt innocent people for the sole purpose of plunder.
But, I couldn't do anything more than that.
I can't even jump out of that place.
I knew best that I was a powerless being.
Female-Speaker: "But, how did you find such a small town?"
Female-Speaker: "--There was a slave who escaped the other day, right?"
Female-Speaker: "If I remember correctly, he was advocating for coexistence with the Phloids..."
Female-Speaker: "Yes. A foolish man trapped in old-fashioned ideas. Coexistence and harmony with the Phloids is such a useless thought in this world."
--Coexistence and harmony...
That word brings to mind a young man.
The last words of the person I helped, brought to this town... and then passed away.
Does that mean these humans are the ones who inflicted those injuries on him?
Female-Speaker: "That's why we treated him the same as the Phloids and kept him alive as labor."
Female-Speaker: "That's right. We were chasing after him to bring him back, and he helped us in an unexpected way."
One of the men continues in a monotonous voice.
Female-Speaker: "After all, a human appeared to help that man and guided us to the town."
Hearing those words, I felt my back getting cold.
Female-Speaker: Why didn't I think about the cause of that young man's injuries back then?
Female-Speaker: I should have heard from Shiona that there was a group carrying out looting...
Even when returning to town, if I had paid more attention to my surroundings, I might have avoided being followed.
I regret taking such a thoughtless action on a momentary impulse.
I am the one who created the cause of this attack.
Female-Speaker: "We have finished gathering the main guys of the town in one place. There are zero rebels."
Female-Speaker: "I see. Then, select those among them who are oral ingestion types and have no production or management abilities. Factors that reduce productivity are--"
As he said that, the man receiving the report took out a handgun from his pocket.
Female-Speaker: "Dispose of them."
Female-Speaker: "--Stop it!"
At the same time as understanding the meaning of those words, I had shouted.
However, I couldn't help but shout at the humans who so easily said 'dispose' of the townspeople who had taken care of me.
With that, the men who were there turned around.
And, our eyes met.
Female-Speaker: "Secure him."
Along with that voice, the men rushed towards me.
In a hurry, I start running.
But, my body can't keep up with my feelings.
My feet aren't moving well, and I ended up running away while losing my balance.
Immediately, the men are closing in from behind.
Their movements are as precise as machines.
Damn it, at this rate, I'll be caught.
As a last resort, I ran into an alleyway.
The alleyway had many muddy spots due to the rain.
While my feet were being caught, I kept running through.
Occasionally, I knocked over lumber leaning against the walls, trying to slow the men down.
But that level of interference isn't even enough to stall them.
I could tell that the men were closing in right behind me.
Can I keep running away like this...?
What I was aiming for was the library.
Even if I could make it to the library like this, Tippy's existence would be exposed to them.
If Tippy were to be attacked--.
I changed the direction of my toes.
I ran into what seemed to be the back door of the closest building.
Coincidentally, it was Mad's general store.
I searched for a place to hide--.
Female-Speaker: "! ?"
I found a human figure sitting in a chair.
Mad doesn't answer. Just like that day after turning the projector, he was sitting shallowly in the chair with his arms crossed.
Female-Speaker: "Mad, you can hear me, right!? Stop joking around at a time like this, Mad-- Mad?"
I barely managed to swallow my scream.
The moment I touched Mad's shoulder, Mad--quietly collapsed from the chair. As if he were already dead.
Female-Speaker: "W-Why--!"
Female-Speaker: Were you 'disposed of' by those men? But, even so, there are no signs of external wounds.
Female-Speaker: "Target acquired."
What brought me back to my senses as I was about to panic was, ironically, the voices of the men who had been chasing me.
But that was far too late.
Female-Speaker: "The labor force we have now is enough; eliminate him."
Unable to do anything, I just hastily jumped back from Mad, the men stepped in, and the man at the front aimed his handgun at me--
Female-Speaker: "Rei!"
Immediately after, several things happened simultaneously.
A dry sound rang out, the sound of a gunshot.
And, a figure slid in front of me as if to protect me--.
Female-Speaker: "Sh--"
It took me some time to grasp the situation.
That person was standing there, as if protecting me.
That person turned only their face to look at me.
With the same unchanging smile, that person looked at me.
And, a few seconds later--.
Female-Speaker: "Shionaaaaaa!"
With a completely blank mind, I scream.
Seeing that figure, my body started moving unconsciously.
With the mechanical arm hidden under my glove, I punched down one of the shelves. That caused a chain reaction, knocking down shelves all over the store--scattering small fragments and even finer dust everywhere.
At the same time, I picked up a can that had fallen on the floor and threw it with all my might towards the window.
The men react to the sound of the window glass breaking.
Female-Speaker: "Did he escape through the window?"
Female-Speaker: "Chase him!"
The men jump out of the opened door and head outside.
Female-Speaker: "They're gone--"
And as for me, I was squatting still right next to the fallen shelf, with half of my body sunk into the floor that had been dislodged by the impact.
While hugging the fallen Shiona in my arms so that the shelves and fragments wouldn't hit her.
Female-Speaker: "Shiona, Shiona, hang in there!"
I desperately shake Shiona, who has her eyes closed.
It seems she has fainted.
I run my eyes over Shiona's body, but I can't find any wounds.
Could the bullet have missed? But, since she's unconscious, I can't say she's unharmed.
In any case, I have to evacuate once.
The place nearby where I can do that is...
I take a deep breath and remember.
About the girl I left waiting in the library.
I returned to the library, taking the back streets to avoid being seen by the humans.
Carrying Shiona on my back was a considerable handicap, but I proceeded as if crawling through the ruined buildings over and over again.
During that time, Shiona didn't move at all. That helped in terms of carrying her, but at the same time, my anxiety increased.
If something were to happen to Shiona--while being crushed by that fear, I arrived at the library.
The clouds covering the sky had further darkened their hue.
Having finally reached the library, I began searching for Tippy.
Is Tippy alright?
For now, there are no signs of the library having been ransacked.
There's no sign that anyone has entered.
After passing through the entrance, the inside of the library was silent.
Feeling relieved, I weaved between the shelves, searching for Tippy.
However, no matter how much I searched, I couldn't find Tippy.
Could it be--.
As if to dispel the unpleasant thought, I desperately searched the area.
Could it be--.
Relying on hope, I head to the lobby.
I go around to the back of it.
There, I found Tippy, covering her ears and eyes, trembling slightly.
I reach out my hand to that small body.
Female-Speaker: "Tippy, I'm back."
Tippy's shoulders twitched slightly.
But when she recognized me, she hugged me with the force of a jump.
Female-Speaker: "Welcome back. I believed in you, Rei."
She pressed large tears against my chest.
Her body was trembling slightly.
Female-Speaker: Ah, I made this child anxious again.
I put my hand on her back and stroked it.
Female-Speaker: "It's okay... I won't leave you again."
Perhaps relieved by those words, Tippy's trembling lessened and eventually stopped.
Female-Speaker: "What happened? What's wrong with Shiona?"
Tippy stared at Shiona, who still had her eyes closed, and asked anxiously.
I told her the truth without hiding anything.
Female-Speaker: "She was shot. To protect me... She doesn't seem to be injured, but she's unconscious..."
Female-Speaker: "Show me right away!"
With an agility I had never seen before, Tippy picked up Shiona as if to embrace her and laid her on the floor.
Female-Speaker: "Rei, turn around, I'm going to check Shiona's injuries."
Female-Speaker: "Ah, okay... W-Wait, is Shiona injured!?"
Female-Speaker: "I don't know. But I'm going to check."
Seeing Tippy putting her hands on Shiona's clothes, I hurriedly turned around.
Shortly after--
Female-Speaker: "...It's okay, there were no problems... Rei."
Tippy's tone had returned to normal.
I quietly turn around.
On the floor of the lobby where I laid her down, Shiona is breathing peacefully.
I thought she had been shot protecting me, but it seems she just lost consciousness from the close-range gunshot.
Female-Speaker: "I'm glad..."
From the bottom of my heart, I let out a sigh of relief.
Female-Speaker: "Rei, why was Shiona shot?"
Female-Speaker: "The humans came. And they're starting to loot this town. Destroying buildings--"
I didn't mention that they were trying to 'dispose' of the townspeople, or that Mad-san might have already been 'taken care of'.
Female-Speaker: "So when I was found and about to be shot, Shiona protected me--"
I involuntarily clench my fist tightly. Tippy sadly gazes at me like that, and
Female-Speaker: "--I see. But if that's the case... this place might be dangerous too."
She answered with a solemn face.
Female-Speaker: "I wonder if we can get through this by hiding... somehow until the humans leave..."
As if to stop my words, Tippy sadly shook her head from side to side.
Female-Speaker: "The humans have found this town. A town for them to live in. So, they'll come here too."
Female-Speaker: "No way... those guys are going to settle down here...?"
Female-Speaker: "Because this is a 'town'."
A town... That's right.
I walked through barren lands before reaching this place.
Without food or water, I was constantly facing death.
Female-Speaker: Those humans must have traveled through such a world too.
If that's the case, this "town" is a paradise they couldn't have wished for.
Female-Speaker: "But... even so, why do they do things like stealing? The people of this town would have accepted them."
Female-Speaker: "It's for them to live."
Female-Speaker: "Just because of that, to think it's okay to do anything... to sacrifice someone is wrong!"
Female-Speaker: "...Rei, I'm scared..."
Female-Speaker: "Ah, sorry, I didn't mean to scare you, Tippy..."
I released the fist I had clenched in anger and stroked Tippy's head to reassure her.
Let's think about Tippy and Shiona for now.
If we stay in town like this, these two will be in danger too.
I really want to help everyone in town. But, it's impossible for me right now. I don't have the power or wisdom.
I'll freeze the emotions that Shiona and the townspeople taught me, and mechanically... make the most efficient choice.
Let's go somewhere we can settle down for a while.
Female-Speaker: "Tippy, let's leave town for now. And let's think about how to help the townspeople."
As I said that, my chest tightened.
It's because I put a rank on lives.
I chose the lives in front of me, within reach.
That must be a shameful thing. The weight of life is equal, but... even so, I'm trying to choose...
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I think that's a good idea."
The little girl's nod lightens my sense of guilt.
Female-Speaker: "Let's hide in that abandoned factory for now. There shouldn't be anything there that humans would want."
Female-Speaker: "Then, I have to prepare food for you and Shiona..."
Female-Speaker: "That's right. I wish we could somehow stop by the church."
The library where we are now and the church are on opposite sides of the square, at opposite ends of town.
Even if we leave town and make a big detour, we'll be sitting ducks if they snipe at us in a place with no cover. On top of that, I'll be carrying Shiona on my back.
In that case, is the only option to proceed while crawling under the rubble again? It'll be even more difficult this time since Tippy will be with us...
I explained that to Tippy as clearly as possible.
Female-Speaker: "Is it hard to go to the church?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah... for now."
Female-Speaker: "Then, you should go under."
Female-Speaker: "...Under?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, under. Go to the church through under the ground."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, underground. If it's underground, no one will find you."
Female-Speaker: "Underground... Underground, huh... But how?"
Female-Speaker: "You can go inside through the manhole, and then go under the town."
...I see.
Certainly, if we do that, we should be able to get to the church without being seen by anyone.
Female-Speaker: "That's a great idea, Tippy! You're amazing, Tippy."
Female-Speaker: "Ehehe... Rei praised me."
Female-Speaker: "But, I wonder where the manholes are located in town."
Female-Speaker: "Hmm... Rei, come here."
Tippy takes my hand and guides me to the bookshelf.
Without the slightest hesitation, she came to a certain bookshelf.
Female-Speaker: "That book."
I take the book Tippy is pointing at and open it.
Inside, there was a map of the town's manhole locations and its underground waterways.
Female-Speaker: "You're amazing, Tippy! If we have this, we can get to the church without any problems."
Female-Speaker: "Thank you... Rei."
When I stroke her head, Tippy narrows her eyes and rejoices.
Female-Speaker: "Alright, Tippy. Let's depart right away."
Female-Speaker: "Yes... but wait. I'll get ready, so wait just a little bit--okay?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, that's fine."
Female-Speaker: "Thank you, Rei."
With a quick bow, Tippy disappeared into the back room.
Tippy said there were no problems, but I'm still worried that Shiona hasn't regained consciousness.
Perhaps the humans didn't shoot a bullet-firing gun, but a weapon that robs the body of its freedom.
If I know the cause, I can also figure out how to deal with it.
Is this how terrifying an unknown situation can be?
Female-Speaker: "Rei, sorry to keep you waiting. --What's wrong?"
Tippy came back from the back room.
Female-Speaker: "No, it's nothing. I was just a little worried about Shiona."
I answered, trying to appear as calm as possible.
Female-Speaker: "So, what are you taking with you?"
Tippy, who said she had prepared, was carrying a large bag.
Female-Speaker: "A stuffed animal and... a picture book and... crayons."
Female-Speaker: "I see. They're important to you, aren't they?"
Female-Speaker: "And... pictures of Papa and Mama."
Tippy said sadly.
Photos of her parents who will probably never come back.
I don't understand Tippy's feelings as she stares at the photos.
Female-Speaker: "Um, so what's this?"
Apart from the large bag, Tippy was carrying a thin but sturdy metal bag in her hand. It felt a little too rugged for little Tippy to carry.
Female-Speaker: "This is... I'll tell you about it later. More importantly, Rei, let's go."
Female-Speaker: "Ah, okay..."
With Tippy's help, I carried Shiona, who was lying on the floor, on my back. Strangely, I couldn't feel the weight.
Female-Speaker: "I'm ready, Tippy."
Female-Speaker: "Okay, then... goodbye."
Tippy said goodbye to the countless bookshelves.
Her voice sounded somewhat sad.
I still haven't been able to heal this girl's sadness at all.
But I haven't given up.
We'll be together from now on.
Even if it's just little by little, as we spend time together...
I want to heal Tippy's sadness.
And someday, I want Tippy to have a heartfelt smile on her face.
That was my secret wish right now.
Female-Speaker: "Okay, let's go."
Female-Speaker: "--Yeah."
Even so, Tippy followed me without uttering a single complaint.
By the time we reached the church, we were quite exhausted.
There was no sign of humans around.
We carefully looked around and stepped into the church.
The chapel was silent.
It was a silence that made the town's commotion seem like a lie.
I found a music box on the altar at the back of the chapel.
Was this where Shiona listened to its melody?
The sound of my footsteps towards the music box echoed loudly in the chapel.
I approached the altar and reached for the music box.
As I turned the handle, a melody poured out from inside.
The melody somehow warmed the depths of my heart.
--Suddenly, I heard a singing voice.
It was coming from behind me.
Female-Speaker: "Welcome back."
Shiona said that and got off my back.
Female-Speaker: "That's not important. Do you have any pain? Tippy said you were okay, but..."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I seem to be fine."
Shiona smiled to reassure me. Then, she looked at Tippy, who was next to her.
Female-Speaker: "Tippy-chan... you came too, huh?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah--"
Tippy nodded, looking as sad as always--yet with a look of resolve on her face.
Female-Speaker: "Shiona..."
Tippy held out her palm towards Shiona, stopping her words.
Female-Speaker: "I understand... I understand, but!"
Shiona looked down, as if enduring something.
Female-Speaker: "--Shiona"
In response, Tippy was gentle as ever...
It was too unexpected of a word. Shiona is holding her breath and staring at Tippy's small eyes.
Female-Speaker: "While I was with Rei, I realized it. What Shiona is trying to do."
Female-Speaker: "But, if that's the case--"
Female-Speaker: "That's also why I came here. The library is impossible now... Probably this town too."
Female-Speaker: "Tippy-chan, I'm sorry..."
Female-Speaker: "It's okay. Shiona doesn't have to cry, you know."
Tippy said that as she gently hugged Shiona, who knelt down and jumped into Tippy's arms.
It was as if Tippy was the older sister, giving me such an illusion.
Female-Speaker: "Rei, what are you going to do now?"
Tippy's words startled me back to reality.
Female-Speaker: "If Shiona seems okay, I want to help the people in town. Especially the people who were said to be disposed of--"
Female-Speaker: "Disposed of?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah..."
It was a terrible way of putting it... Speaking as if they didn't see fellow humans as humans.
Female-Speaker: "Can you do it, Rei?"
Female-Speaker: "I don't know, but--even so, I can't just stand by and watch someone about to be killed right in front of me."
Female-Speaker: "But, you'll be in danger, Rei."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I know that, but..."
We're dealing with guys who will point guns at us without hesitation. There's nothing we can do by confronting them head-on.
I'm sure we won't even be able to have a discussion.
Female-Speaker: "I promise you. If it gets even a little dangerous, I'll definitely turn back."
Female-Speaker: "You absolutely have to. If you get hurt--everything will be irreversible."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah. I can't just leave Shiona behind either, you know."
Female-Speaker: "Rei..."
Female-Speaker: "Shiona--"
With that one word, we separated as if magnets repelled each other.
Female-Speaker: "I-I'm sorry! It's not like I forgot about Tippy-chan!"
Female-Speaker: "Only Shiona is unfair..."
Tippy pouted slightly, saying such a thing.
Female-Speaker: "I'm sorry, Tippy. I didn't mean it that way..."
I apologized as well, gently stroking Tippy's head.
Female-Speaker: "Muu... That's not it though..."
Even so, Tippy's expression wasn't entirely displeased.
First Shiona laughed at that sight--then I, and Tippy, smiled as well.
And so, we laughed together.
Without anyone saying anything, the three of us held hands.
As if never to be separated again, we gripped each other's hands tightly.
And, before that resolve could waver, I declared.
Female-Speaker: "From now on, let's always be together, the three of us. Always--"
But, as if mocking me...
In the distance, footsteps echoed.
Shiona's smile, Tippy's smile, stiffened.
I'm sure I'm stiffening up too.
All the townspeople have been captured.
Then, the one heading towards this church now is--
Without a doubt, it's a human.
I was the first to move. I looked out the window, being careful not to make a sound.
There's one figure. However, I don't know how many more are coming behind.
Female-Speaker: "Shiona, Tippy, head to the back of the chapel. Crouch down as much as possible, so you can't be seen from outside."
Female-Speaker: "That's fine, but shouldn't we lock the door first?"
Female-Speaker: "No, that would definitely call for backup. If that happens, we won't stand a chance."
I want to neutralize the human outside without making as much noise as possible.
If there's only one person, I think I can manage. If there are two, we can somehow manage with a surprise attack.
But, if there are three or more--I haven't told Shiona or Tippy, but I was prepared to be captured alone.
I muffled my footsteps and stood in the shadow of the door. In the meantime, the footsteps are getting closer and closer.
The number is one. For now, there's no one following behind.
Female-Speaker: "...Haaah..."
I quietly took a deep breath and steeled myself.
I held my breath. The footsteps are--right next to me.
The door slowly opened.
Then, a man with a pistol slowly entered.
--Now!
In that instant, I swung my arm down with all my might from his blind spot.
Immediately, I kicked away the pistol that fell to the floor.
At the same time, I tried to sweep his legs, but as expected, he dodged it.
We're still at a distance where we're almost touching each other.
It's probably safe to assume that he possesses weapons other than a gun.
If so, I can catch him off guard by pouncing on him the moment he reaches for it.
But, the man quietly tilted his head and looked at me.
Female-Speaker: "What do you intend to do, you?"
He asked in a voice devoid of inflection.
Female-Speaker: "Why are you antagonizing us? Are you the owner of this town?"
Female-Speaker: "Owner? I just want to do what's best for the people of this town."
Female-Speaker: "That's quite the Philoid-like thing to say."
Female-Speaker: "...So what if it is... That's my reason for existence."
As I said that, I removed the glove from my right hand, showing off my mechanical hand.
It's not a good idea to fight me head-on with my mechanical body.
If I can make him think that, he might back down.
Right now, I just need to ensure Shiona and Tippy's safety. Even if my true identity is exposed to them, I will protect what I want to protect.
That is my role as a Philoid.
The man tilted his head again at my actions.
Female-Speaker: "What are you saying? Philoids cannot initiate any combat actions. They are made to obey orders, so they cannot defy humans."
Female-Speaker: "Huh?"
Female-Speaker: "In any case, you are an incompatible person trapped by old-fashioned ideas. I will eliminate you before you become a source of trouble."
The blade is thrust straight towards my throat.
I grabbed the blade of the knife with my mechanical right hand. Then, I put all my strength into it and twisted it sharply.
With just that, the knife blade snapped off from the base.
I put all my body weight on him and pushed him down. I put my left elbow against his throat and pinned his legs with my knees--
Female-Speaker: "Rei!"
Shiona jumped out from the back of the room.
I pressed down on the man's throat with my left hand again, and said while raising my metal right hand.
It's a metal arm that can break a knife. If I swing it down on his head with all my might, he won't be unscathed.
Female-Speaker: "Rei, stop."
Shiona pleaded in a trembling voice.
--But.
While grinding my teeth, I swung down my right hand with all my might--
My right hand was half-buried.
Not in the man's head, but in the floor right next to it.
Female-Speaker: "Why spare me? Considering your own safety, killing me is the right choice."
Female-Speaker: The man said that, still without any expression.
Female-Speaker: "That's not true. Killing is the wrong choice, no matter the reason."
Female-Speaker: "Incorrigible. Such an inefficient way of thinking."
Female-Speaker: "I'll have to take you hostage. And make them release the townspeople."
I grabbed the man by the collar and pulled him up.
Female-Speaker: "That's meaningless. My life isn't worth that much. If dying now opens up a future for my comrades, there's no reason to hesitate."
Without changing his tone at all, the man took something out of his pocket.
It was an old-fashioned bomb. He pulled out the safety pin and grabbed my arm at the same time.
Female-Speaker: "What!"
I pulled my arm back reflexively, but it didn't budge.
I shuddered.
Why doesn't this human show any emotion on his face, even at this moment when he's about to throw away his life?
I felt as if my body was being bound by the color of his eyes, which seemed devoid of will.
--No good! If I let my thinking stop, it's over!
I instantly switched gears and started analyzing the situation.
What the man is holding is a really small bomb, about the size of a small fruit.
But, since it's a bomb, it probably has lethal force, and more than anything, the blast could alert the humans staying in town.
When, when will it explode?
The other party intends to self-destruct. It's certain that there isn't much time.
But, what should I do? If the scale of the explosion is large, Shiona and the others who are hiding will also be affected.
It's impossible to neutralize this bomb, so what's the best way to minimize its effect?
I reflexively hugged the man. In a way that sandwiches the bomb.
This way, I might at least be able to protect Shiona and the others from the blast. It might be imperfect, but it's the best choice I can think of.
If only I can save at least the two of them──
The next moment, the impact came.
From the side. Like being shoved away...no, that's wrong, I was shoved away!
While rolling on the floor, I looked at where I had been.
There, was Shiona holding the bomb.
Female-Speaker: "Shiona!"
Female-Speaker: "Get down!"
The bomb she was clutching exploded with a strong light and sound.
Perhaps the scale of the explosion wasn't that large because it was a type of bomb not intended for killing.
Even so, I, who was at point-blank range, was directly hit by the blast and sound, and felt dizzy.
The human who was also at point-blank range has also lost consciousness.
Female-Speaker: "Shiona!"
In my vision that was swaying dizzily, I shouted.
Please, please be safe.
Female-Speaker: "Shiona!?"
Female-Speaker: "...Rei..."
Female-Speaker: "Shio...na..."
Female-Speaker: "Shiona, I'll treat you right away!"
The distance of a few steps felt incredibly long.
While slapping my faltering legs, I approached Shiona.
That's when I saw it.
Female-Speaker: "What...is this..."
I was speechless when I saw Shiona's figure.
Her right arm was thrown onto the floor...from the wrist onward...a metallic--frame?
It's not bone. Absolutely not. It's clearly different from that of a human.
And--it's not there.
That's strange.
Something that should be there, wasn't.
Red.
That is proof of a human.
Female-Speaker: "Wh...wh...why?"
Female-Speaker: "B-but..."
I clench my mechanical right hand, which is covered by a glove.
That's right, if we were the same...if only we were the same....
Female-Speaker: "Shiona, are you...okay?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, I'm fine, even with this much."
There's no way that's true.
There's no way that could be true.
Female-Speaker: You took the explosion at such close range.
There's no way you could be okay.
It must be so painful that she can't help but shed tears from the intense pain.
And yet.
And yet, why?
Female-Speaker: "Rather than me... Rei, your head."
I followed Shiona's gaze and touched my head.
--Ah, why is this happening?
Why is it that something Shiona needs is with me?
I don't need this.
I don't need this, so I wish Shiona had it instead.
No, she should have it.
Shiona touches my head and says.
Female-Speaker: "You're bleeding, are you okay?"
Blood was flowing from my head.
Red.
It's red blood.
Something that doesn't flow in a Phiroyd...
In contrast, not even a drop of blood was flowing from Shiona's arm.
Instead, I can see the exposed mechanical parts.
What this means is only one thing.
That is--
Female-Speaker: "...Rei? There was a big noise, are you okay--Shiona!? Rei!?"
Tipi, who came out from the back, screamed.
With an uneasy expression, her eyes are filled with tears.
Female-Speaker: "Both of you, I have to heal your injuries...!".
Female-Speaker: "I'm okay...I'm okay, so..."
I gently hug Tipi, who was on the verge of panicking, as if to envelop her.
Embraced, Tipi showed a slightly relieved expression in my arms.
But it was an unstable thing.
It looked like it was about to collapse at any moment, and it hurt deep in my chest to see it.
Female-Speaker: "Rei...let's move, we can't stay here anymore..."
Tipi says in a trembling voice. Shiona also nods in agreement.
Certainly, with the sound of the explosion just now, the other humans will definitely come.
There were many things I wanted to ask.
There were many things I wanted to confirm.
But, I swallow it all down for now.
Female-Speaker: "...Let's go, let's leave the town."
We left the church with only the bare minimum of luggage.
Then, following Tipi's instructions, we used the back streets of the town to escape to the outside, and headed for the abandoned factory.
I was reminded of it there too...
It was only me whose footsteps became heavy with fatigue...
Led by Tipi and with Shiona pulling my hand, we continue walking.
Reaching the abandoned factory, I finally lowered myself to the ground.
Next to Shiona, who has a cool face, I regulate my rough breathing.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi, I'm going to fetch some water."
The little girl glanced at Shiona and then disappeared into the depths of the abandoned factory.
She probably entrusted all the explanations to Shiona.
Female-Speaker: "...Shiona."
At my voice, Shiona returns a slightly troubled smile.
Female-Speaker: "I think you've already noticed, but I am...no. Everyone living in this town is a Phiroyd."
That was...something I was trying to avoid facing.
I had a premonition...I also felt something was off...but it was something I didn't want to admit...
Female-Speaker: "So...I'm a 'human'?"
When my head was damaged, a red liquid leaked from the damaged area.
It closely resembled the 'blood' that flows inside a human body.
Phiroyds aren't equipped with such a liquid, so it shouldn't flow.
Female-Speaker: "You've been misunderstanding all along because you have a mechanical arm...that's a medical artificial part to compensate for a limb you lost in an accident or something."
Female-Speaker: "So...then I really am..."
Female-Speaker: "Yes, you are a human. The parent and partner who created us Phiroyds. That is who you are. Everyone in town is a Phiroyd. Only you were human."
Female-Speaker: "I see..."
I stare at my mechanical right hand covered in a glove, and weakly clench it.
The existence I thought I was is the complete opposite... .
Shiona is a Phiroyd... and I am a human...
--In other words, I am a human, the very existence I should hate.
I felt something deep inside my chest.
That feeling was painful.
Sad.
And infuriating.
Female-Speaker: I was the same existence as that cold, merciless being that I could only think of as evil.
My chest ached unbearably.
I felt anger at the unchangeable truth.
What the man I was dealing with earlier said was right.
I wasn't a Phiroyd, but a human.
And those humans, the rulers, are trying to do terrible things to the people of the Phiroyd town, the ruled--no, they probably already are.
How did things end up like this?
I just wanted to live with Shiona and the people of the town.
I just wanted to make everyone happy.
But, but, but--.
I can't do that.
Because I'm a human.
Because I'm one of those hopeless creatures.
I felt warmth in my fist, which I had been unconsciously clenching.
When I lowered my gaze, Shiona's hand was placed over it.
That temperature is artificial.
But, it didn't matter to me.
...It's warm.
That alone thins out the emotions that were burdening my heart.
But at the same time, it highlights my own inadequacy.
Do I even deserve her kindness?
Female-Speaker: "Do you want to know more? About you humans?"
Shiona said, turning a smile towards me.
Female-Speaker: "By 'you humans,' do you mean humans?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, humans. Do you want to know about our partners?"
If I can know, I want to know.
So I nodded.
Female-Speaker: "I want to know...I want to know why we became like this."
Female-Speaker: "Rei, do you remember the picture of Tipi-chan that was in the library?"
Female-Speaker: "Ah, I remember..."
Female-Speaker: "That picture, Tipi-chan draws it every day. Every single day, no matter what, one picture a day."
I closed my eyelids and recalled that scene.
There were dozens, hundreds of those pictures drawn with crayons.
Female-Speaker: "How many do you think there are?"
Female-Speaker: "I don't know... If Tipi is also a Phiroyd, she's probably been drawing them for years... Maybe around a thousand."
Female-Speaker: "Eighty-six thousand six hundred and seventy-one."
Female-Speaker: "Eighty-six thou--"
Once again, a strong dizziness attacked me. But it wasn't from the explosion earlier, or the subsequent bleeding.
For so long, Tipi had been spending time all alone in that dark library.
Female-Speaker: There were hardly any people who came to that library.
It must have been a lonely existence.
Just thinking about the time Tipi has spent there, I felt a terror as if I was losing my footing.
Tipi had endured all of that.
Female-Speaker: With that small body of hers.
Female-Speaker: "From there, several decades before that, we Phiroyds were born. Desired by you humans--"
Shiona told me the history of the Phiroyds as if singing a song.
First, Phiroyds were androids that had reached the practical stage, equipped with human emotions.
Basic emotional information was installed from the beginning, and a system was adopted that allowed them to learn new emotions through an independent thinking circuit.
Including that, it can be said that they are as close to humans as possible.
Therefore, they were able to become as close to humans as possible, not only in work but also in life.
Eventually, companies appeared that installed custom-made emotions and memories, and an unprecedented Phiroyd boom arrived.
Families who could not have children purchased child Phiroyds, and those who lost parents or children ordered Phiroyds with their memories, ushering in such an era.
In the blink of an eye, the number of Phiroyds increased, and in just over a dozen years, the number produced was comparable to the human population.
Among them, the most revolutionary was the Phiroyd equipped with 'love,' the most complex emotion of humans.
It had the ability to serve as a companion for life.
You could obtain a loved one without going through the process of romance, and that love was guaranteed semi-permanently.
In a society where late marriage was progressing and more humans were prioritizing work over romance, the demand was great and it was received with applause.
However, children were not born into families who married Phiroyds, which accelerated the declining birthrate.
And the declining birthrate created a shortage of marriage partners, creating a loop in which more and more marital relationships with Phiroyds increased.
Female-Speaker: "And then, before they knew it, humans forgot how to nurture love."
Shiona smiled sadly.
Female-Speaker: "Human children began to be created artificially using science. But humans who had lost love could not teach love to the children who were born."
Love was the origin of all emotions.
Because there is love, you feel the joy of connecting with someone.
Because there is love, you know what you want to protect and feel anger when it is hurt.
Because there is love, you feel sadness when you lose something precious.
Because there is love...you share the same emotions, share them, and know joy.
But...they forgot that.
The humans who came to town are probably those kinds of "humans."
Humans who have forgotten "emotion" along with love have even lost the ability to care for others.
Humans no longer needed love, and the existence of Phiroyds with emotions became unpleasant to them.
When considering the efficiency of actions, there were too many unnecessary things... or so they thought.
Humans eventually came to believe that Phiroyds should be machines.
Female-Speaker: They deliberately put us in harsh environments... for tasks involving danger... for abuse exceeding specification limits...
But, there were also humans who didn't approve of that.
The humans who retained the emotion of love appealed, saying that Phiroyds are partners.
The world was divided in two.
Humans with love, and humans without.
And the humans without love concluded.
That the ideas of the old generation were foolish, that they should be annihilated...
They didn't even hesitate to press the button for a weapon that would scorch the earth.
Female-Speaker: After that, everything happened quickly.
It didn't even take five days for retaliation to call for retaliation, and for the world to be enveloped in flames and ash.
Polluted, poisonous earth, black clouds blocking the sunlight, a sea that could not sustain life.
Human history would come to an end by its own hand...
It was such a foolish choice.
Female-Speaker: "We, who were born for humans, ended up taking away what was most important to humans."
Female-Speaker: "That's not true... the fault lies with us humans in everything..."
Female-Speaker: "But you know, there were also many humans who survived. No matter how tattered the world becomes, life never stops moving forward."
I couldn't find the words to respond to Shiona, who spoke to me so gently.
Female-Speaker: "...Ahem, ah, aah, aah."
Suddenly, Shiona started vocal exercises.
And then, she turned to face my puzzled self directly──
Female-Speaker: "Nice to meet you. I am ASOH International model MODA-117 Alice mk-17. Have you completed your user registration? If you have registered, please decide on my individual name. It's the first name I'll be given. Please choose it carefully!"
I was caught completely off guard.
It's not just that I'd never seen it before... it's that it was the first time I'd seen Shiona so utterly cheerful and innocent.
Female-Speaker: "Were you surprised?"
Shiona asked, returning to her usual self.
Female-Speaker: "Y-yeah..."
Female-Speaker: "That's the oldest memory I have."
I wonder when that was. I can't even imagine.
Female-Speaker: "Back then, every day was like a festival... it was so lively."
Saying that, Shiona showed me a piece of paper that looked like a newspaper clipping.
"World-renowned Musician Passes Away"
The photo on it was the same one in the photo frame in Shiona's room.
He had a face similar to mine.
Female-Speaker: "Is this... your older brother?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, this story is also quite old... You see, I'm the latest model among the Phiroyds that were manufactured. Fifth generation, I think."
I wonder how Shiona feels about describing herself as 'manufactured'.
Phiroyds have emotions just like humans.
In other words, they are the same as humans.
Can she really be so detached about it?
Female-Speaker: "My generation was the first model to be equipped with the concept of human 'death'. It was to get as close to humans as possible. But the models before me don't have that... That's the case with Mad and Tipi-chan. Neither of them can understand 'death'. It's useless to explain it. The day they understand it will never come."
To continue waiting without knowing death.
It's a hope that exists, but a hope that will never be rewarded.
Despair in the name of hope.
To be confronted with that unconditionally.
If I'm going to be confronted with something like that, wouldn't it be better to just teach me despair from the start?
I thought it would be better for me that way.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi-chan is an even earlier model... I think she was a second-generation Phiroyd. Up to the second generation, they couldn't extract energy from food. That's why she runs on electricity. But there's a limit to how long the battery lasts. She carries that bear plushie as an auxiliary battery for that."
Come to think of it, Tipi always had that stuffed animal in her hand whenever she moved somewhere.
I had no idea it was a battery.
But that explains something.
That Tipi was always in that library.
Female-Speaker: That library has the only power generation system in town.
Tipi was staying in that place in order to continue functioning.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi-chan's parents also died a long time ago. Probably more than 200 years ago. But Tipi-chan, who has no concept of death, is waiting. Always, all alone."
What a cruel story.
I don't know the lifespan of a Phiroyd, but Tipi has spent hundreds of years like that.
Every day, shedding tears.
Trapped by a future that will never come... by an unfulfilled hope.
In that library all alone.
It feels like there's a lead ball in the depths of my chest.
It's painful and agonizing.
But the more I think about it, the more it sinks into the depths of me.
Female-Speaker: "But, it's painful even knowing that."
And Shiona is aware of death. In other words, she can't even hold onto the hope that we might meet again.
Female-Speaker: "Ray, you saw Mad collapse at the general store, didn't you?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah... it was strange. It was as if only his soul had left, without any external wounds--"
I understand now. Mad was already broken at that time.
Female-Speaker: "But, we have to keep living like this. Until the day of our death--our breaking point. For us who don't get sick, that's a time equal to eternity. That's why we try to be human. Wouldn't it be too sad otherwise? We take over the work that our partners did, or do the work of positions that have disappeared... We keep the world turning, just like humans did. So that this world that humans turned will never stop."
Mad ran the general store.
There were various shops in town, like a photography studio and a bar.
All of that was the work of the Phiroyds.
It was the effort of the Phiroyds to protect the human world.
It was the last hope of the Phiroyds who had been left behind.
Female-Speaker: "So that when humans return someday, we can tell them about that fun time, so we can return it to them, we spend every day like this."
Shiona showed me a smile.
An emotion that was by no means appropriate for the current situation.
With that smile, Shiona was protecting herself.
That smile looked sad to me.
Female-Speaker: "...But, we Phiroyds also have flaws. That is, if something unbearably painful happens, only some kind of emotion comes to the forefront. I'm like this, Mad is always angry, and Tipi-chan is always sad."
But, Shiona continued.
Female-Speaker: "That's our last stronghold. If even that emotion disappears, we'll break... we'll die."
Female-Speaker: "Then, when Shiona was shot, Mad was--"
Female-Speaker: "That's right. He didn't just go on a trip. After Ray finished showing him that movie, Mad stopped mov--no, he stopped moving."
Female-Speaker: "Then, closing the shop was--Shiona?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes. I thought that if I didn't, Ray would have doubts, not to mention the townspeople. And you did, didn't you?"
Female-Speaker: "Well, yeah, but..."
If the shop had remained open there, I would have undoubtedly entered the store and found Mad unmoving.
If the humans hadn't come, I probably never would have noticed.
In the end, it was confirmed that I wasn't just seeing things.
I didn't want to believe it, but that was the truth.
Female-Speaker: "My brother used to say, 'Emotions are pieces of the puzzle of life.' The piece called emotion connects life. If an emotion is missing, all the pieces will crumble away. That's the same for humans and Phiroyds. Mad broke because the emotion of anger towards his son dissipated."
If that's the case, then I killed Mad.
I found the playback device on my own and made Mad watch his son's movie without permission.
If I hadn't done that, Mad would have continued to move without breaking.
Perhaps sensing my feelings, Shiona moved to my left side and placed her hand over mine.
Female-Speaker: "It's okay, it's not Ray's fault. Sooner or later, we're all destined to end up like that. It's the same as humans not being able to escape death. Mad was surely happy. He was able to know his son's true feelings in the end."
Female-Speaker: "Maybe so. But--"
An unbearable feeling swells up.
Female-Speaker: If I had known that back then--I would have stopped him, even by force.
Female-Speaker: "You're so kind, Ray--"
Female-Speaker: "That's not true..."
Shiona stood next to me.
I couldn't see Shiona's expression.
Anxiety pounded against my chest from the inside.
Female-Speaker: "Because even knowing, I still wish for it. I wonder if I'll ever see that smile again."
Shiona smiled sadly as she looked down at her brother's photo.
Female-Speaker: "That's why, when I first met you, Ray, I was so happy. Ah, so it was a dream after all, I thought. My brother was alive."
The matter of dying.
Whether you know it or not, it was a painful thing.
Made to be convenient for humans, forced to have a family, and then leaving behind only the pain of death.
Selfish and the worst.
That was us, humans.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi-chan is feeling the loneliness of losing her family. That's why, if you act like family, she'll 'die'. But that doesn't mean I don't want you to say those words to Ray. We Phiroyds have a rule that we mustn't do or say anything that 'makes us realize we are Phiroyds'. Because it would destroy the humans' dreams. But, I went too far... I'm sorry."
When Shiona lowered her head, a sweet scent wafted through the air.
Certainly, what Shiona did was not something that could be forgiven.
But, considering Shiona's feelings, it was also clear that that method was the most appropriate.
Female-Speaker: "It can't be helped. Shiona was just following the rules, it's not your fault."
Forgiving someone like this, and someone being forgiven.
Apologizing, and being apologized to.
Crying, getting angry, laughing.
That's what humans are.
They, the Phiroyds, knew that better than anyone.
Female-Speaker: "Thank you for telling me, Shiona. For being so kind to me, a human--"
I felt ashamed as a human.
To think that I'm repaying the kindness of these Phiroyds who are doing so much with evil.
Even as we're talking, humans in town might be 'disposing' of Phiroyds.
And the Phiroyds probably can't offer much resistance to that.
Thinking about that, I couldn't hide the pain deep in my chest.
Shiona gently reached out and embraced me.
A warm warmth enveloped me.
Female-Speaker: "Of course. Humans and Phiroyds are partners, both in the past and now. It's decided that it will be that way far into the future, too."
I felt like the emotion I couldn't understand until the very end was there.
It was warm, broad, deep, strong, gentle, soft, large, and precious.
Humans had lost something significant.
But, they remembered what the humans had forgotten.
For many years, many decades, many centuries.
While enduring loneliness, they continued to protect it.
I felt like I had to take over that and protect it in the same way.
It wasn't a duty or an order.
It was something I myself desired.
Female-Speaker: "I'm back, I found some clean water."
While Shiona and I were sharing body heat, Tipi called out to us from behind.
For some reason, I felt embarrassed and instinctively distanced myself from Shiona.
The warmth that had been touching my skin was snatched away by the air.
But, that gap was immediately filled with a new warmth.
Looking, I saw that Tipi had squeezed in between Shiona and me.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi too--give me a hug."
Shiona and I exchanged glances.
Shiona seemed to be entrusting the decision to me.
Tipi had lived in solitude for two hundred years.
If things continued as they were, Tipi could continue to live semi-permanently without breaking.
But, would that be happiness?
Does an empty life have any value?
I embraced Shiona.
Including Tipi, who was standing between us.
Shiona, in the same way, embraced me.
Tipi hugged both of us and muttered softly.
Female-Speaker: "Warm..."
It was a warmth she hadn't felt in two hundred years.
Tipi had been waiting for something so trivial for two hundred years.
It was a very sad time....
If I could give her two hundred years' worth of warmth, I would definitely want to give it to Tipi.
Because if I did, I feel like I could say that the time Tipi waited wasn't wasted.
Female-Speaker: "What are you going to do now, Ray?"
Shiona asks me while still holding Tipi from behind.
Female-Speaker: "If I could... I still want to help everyone in town... but I don't think I can right now."
I feel bad for the people in town, but I don't have the power to do so.
First, I want to ensure the safety of Shiona and Tipi.
Female-Speaker: "It's a little far, but let's go to the factory where I woke up."
No, that place probably wasn't a factory at all.
A facility where people continued to sleep until the contaminated land in a world where people could no longer live due to war became even a little better.
I... my awakening was a little late.
Female-Speaker: "Electricity was still running there. Shiona and I can ingest food orally, so we can manage if we have food brought from town. But in Tipi's case, she needs to be charged."
Female-Speaker: "Shiona..."
She probably realized it just from those words. Tipi raised her voice.
Female-Speaker: "Yes, that's right... I'm sorry."
Female-Speaker: "No. I thought I had to say it soon."
Tipi continues, sounding somewhat sad, yet with a slightly stiff expression.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi also has to do what Tipi can do... while there's still time."
Female-Speaker: "...Tipi-chan?"
Female-Speaker: "Did something catch on you?"
Shiona asks Tipi, pressing for an answer.
Female-Speaker: "The three of us, let's survive."
It was a baseless statement.
There was no guarantee or anything.
Even so, I could only continue to say those words.
Female-Speaker: "We're going to survive together, the three of us, forever and ever."
It was just an ideal.
I know that the world isn't sweet enough to live on ideals alone.
Of course, Shiona probably knows that too.
Even so, Shiona doesn't raise any doubts to me.
Anxiety and dissatisfaction.
She sealed all of those words away.
Surely her heart must have been filled with them.
In fact, my heart was being ravaged by those feelings.
Even so, it was necessary.
Words of hope.
Female-Speaker: "...Yes."
Shiona nodded and hugged me and Tipi even tighter.
And so, we began our journey towards the facility.
Female-Speaker: "So this is outside of town..."
Witnessing the wilderness before her, Tipi clutches her bear plushie to her chest.
Female-Speaker: "Is this different from the scenery Tipi knows?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes. When I saw it before, there was a road, a forest, and then--and then--"
The scenery Tipi described was an even larger-scale version of the festival-like days that Shiona had told me about.
It seems that in those days, humans freely controlled not only towns, but also nature, the Philoids, and even the weather.
Female-Speaker: "So that means... by the time I started operating, humans had already begun to decline..."
Shiona looks a little lonely. The hem of her clothes is blown wildly by the sand-filled wind.
Female-Speaker: "Okay, let's go!"
With a little food and a spare battery for Tipi, we started walking through the wilderness to survive.
And more than anything, to live through it.
Female-Speaker: Struggle, struggle, and survive.
Flounder, flounder, and stay alive.
It's enough just to be alive.
There was value in just being alive.
I truly thought so from the bottom of my heart.
Using the position of the sun, faintly discernible through the dim clouds, as a guide, I walk while searching my memory.
As the sun sets and the temperature drops, the three of us huddle together and fall asleep.
Sometimes singing songs, sometimes encouraging each other, sometimes joking around...
We continue our journey, which is not always just painful.
We crossed the reddish-brown earth and arrived at our destination three full days later, just as the sun was beginning to set.
Female-Speaker: "The building is half-buried in sand... no wonder it couldn't be found. I can't believe this kind of facility was still around..."
When we entered the interior, faint lights illuminated the space, and air conditioning hummed faintly from somewhere.
The room was exactly the same as when I woke up. First, I'll put away all the Philoid parts that would be unpleasant for Shiona and Tipi.
I'm sure these Philoids were protecting us humans who were in cold sleep.
Female-Speaker: "Yay, I can sit down!"
Tipi ran off and quickly sat down on the sofa that was there.
As soon as she sat down, the strength drained from her body.
It seems I had been pushing her quite hard.
Female-Speaker: "...It's kind of cold here."
Female-Speaker: "It's originally a facility for cold sleep, after all."
Even though we're indoors, it's a little colder than outside.
Now that the air conditioning is working, I want to believe that the function to raise the temperature inside the facility is still there.
But I don't know where it is.
Female-Speaker: "I wish we had some kind of heating appliance..."
Female-Speaker: "You can do this. Ray, sit next to Tipi-chan."
Female-Speaker: "Like this?"
Female-Speaker: "Get closer!"
Female-Speaker: "L-Like this?"
When I asked that, almost completely pressed against Tipi, Shiona looked satisfied and said,
Female-Speaker: "Yes, this should be fine!"
And then, she sat on the opposite side of me, where I was close to Tipi.
--As if to be firmly close, like Tipi and I.
Female-Speaker: "See? You're warm now, right?"
Female-Speaker: "Y-Yeah... you're right."
It's certainly warm. It's warm, but...
Female-Speaker: "How is it? Tipi-chan. Are you still cold?"
Female-Speaker: "Mmm... warm."
Tipi narrowed her eyes and snuggled against my arm.
Female-Speaker: "Warm? I'm glad to hear that."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, warm... you're really warm, Ray. It's like..."
Female-Speaker: "Like what?"
Female-Speaker: "When we're like this, it's like we're a family."
Female-Speaker: "............"
Female-Speaker: "Tipi's Papa and Mama, they often hugged Tipi like this."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah. It's like that time, it's warm."
Female-Speaker: "...Yes, it's warm, isn't it."
Female-Speaker: "...Hey, can you hug me again? Can you squeeze Tipi tight?"
I almost hugged her without thinking, but I stopped when I felt Shiona's sad gaze.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi-chan, we can't do that."
Female-Speaker: "Why? Won't you squeeze me tight?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, that's right. Because Tipi-chan, we're not family or anything."
Female-Speaker: "Not family... is Tipi all alone?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes. No matter how long we're together, you're alone. That's something that can't be changed."
If you only picked up the words, they were cold, as if she hated Tipi.
But I understand now.
That those words are full of kindness.
The only emotion left in Tipi.
--Sadness.
To fill Tipi's heart means to release her from sadness...
In other words, it's the same as dying.
Until now, I had been hugging Tipi without thinking.
But perhaps that was too cruel a kindness.
No, perhaps it wasn't even kindness.
It was just a self-satisfying act that only shortened Tipi's lifespan.
Shiona had been enduring it all this time.
To protect Tipi's feeling of sadness... more than anything, to protect Tipi.
She really wanted to hug her, didn't she?
She wanted to pat her head and say kind words to her, didn't she?
She wanted to give her a smile that would turn her heart orange, didn't she?
She had been enduring it all this time, without reaching out to this blue girl.
That's why I thought I had to endure it too.
Even though I thought that... I couldn't stop myself.
I just couldn't bring myself to leave this girl with such a sad expression in front of me.
I embraced Tipi, and even Shiona who was beyond her.
The back of my eyes grew hot.
I know this is an act that shortens Tipi's lifespan, but I ask myself why I can't stop.
Aren't I just temporarily satisfying my own desires...?
I really am human after all...
Selfish, full of self-interest, a human who hurts others.
I hugged them both tightly, painfully so.
I embraced the warmth of two people.
As if filling the void of two hundred years, we brought our warmth closer.
The warmth of three people doesn't let you feel the cold, even in this freezing facility.
It was that warm.
A melody naturally spilled from Shiona's mouth.
That song that Onii-san made.
That melody lights a warmth deep in my heart.
Her gentle singing voice echoed throughout the factory.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi really loves this song that Shiona sings."
Tipi said, burying her face in my chest.
Female-Speaker: "It reminds me of when Papa and Mama were here... and somehow, I can't stop crying."
The girl repeats her sadness.
Tipi has been repeating that sadness for two hundred years.
I may not be able to wipe away that two hundred years' worth of sadness.
But I can give her this moment of warmth.
I decided to put two hundred years' worth of feelings into this fleeting warmth and hug them both.
But that small moment didn't last long.
Female-Speaker: "Huh... Tipi?"
I turn my gaze to Tipi, who is sitting on the sofa.
There, Tipi was blankly staring ahead, as if in a daze.
Female-Speaker: "What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?"
Female-Speaker: "Hmm? ...Hmm..."
She doesn't seem to be doing well.
Is it because she's been released from the tension, or because she's been walking for so long?
Either way, it seems like she needs to rest.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi seems tired too, so shall we rest for today?"
Female-Speaker: "...Y-Yeah."
Her reply is a beat late. It seems she was thinking about something.
Female-Speaker: "Ray, Tipi-chan might be lacking energy. That's why her attention is scattered."
Female-Speaker: "I see... then we need to replenish her electricity. --Huh, how do we do that?"
Female-Speaker: "It's non-contact charging. The charging equipment should be common, so first we need to find a connector and store electricity in the bear plushie."
Female-Speaker: "Got it. If you find something that looks like it, ask me to confirm."
Female-Speaker: "Leave it to me."
Leaving Tipi on the sofa, I start checking the equipment inside the facility.
Many cold sleep devices are lined up. I look for one that is still leaking cold air.
Then, I open the maintenance cover at the base and examine the several cables connected to the distribution panel.
Before long, I discover something that looks like a power connector connected to a thick cable.
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, this type should be fine. Tipi-chan, lend me your plushie."
Shiona borrows the bear plushie from Tipi, opens the zipper on its back, and exposes the connection terminal.
When she inserts the charging connector there, the bear's eyes blink twice.
That must be the signal that charging has started; Shiona breathes a sigh of relief.
Tipi also tightly grips the bear's hand. Just that seems to transmit electricity, and I feel the light in her eyes intensify.
Female-Speaker: "Shiona, let's have a meal too."
I show her the oral blocks that I found when I was looking for the charging cable.
It's the same thing I found when we left this facility.
Female-Speaker: "The taste is nothing compared to Shiona's soup, but I think it's nutritious."
Female-Speaker: "No, I'm happy because I was hungry. Just being able to eat makes my heart feel warm."
I line up the portable dishes and place the oral blocks on top of them.
I thought this would make it look a little more like a meal.
Because it's a time like this, I want to cherish the everyday, even in small ways.
Female-Speaker: I wanted to trace even a little of what we did in that town--at Shiona's house.
Female-Speaker: "It looks delicious."
As if understanding my wish, Shiona smiled at me.
The two of us put our hands together before the meal.
Tipi, who had been watching us, came to our side.
Then, she placed the bear plushie in front of us and put her hands together just like we did.
Female-Speaker: "Together with everyone."
Female-Speaker: "Tipi-chan...?"
Female-Speaker: "Haha, Tipi is a really amazing feast. Very luxurious."
Tipi showed a shy, bashful smile.
In these past few days filled with nothing but hardship, it was a time that put my heart at ease.
Surely, in the distant past, we humans lived such a life with our partners called Phylloids.
No, it should be a life we can still reclaim now.
Just like I, who had lost my emotions, was taught by them... I should be able to reclaim the time I had forgotten...
I was thinking about such things as I brought the remaining oral block on the plate to my mouth.
--It was at that moment.
『Warning. The wear rate of the main battery exceeds 90%. Please perform battery replacement maintenance immediately.』
Suddenly, Tipi started saying such things in a business-like tone.
『Online replacement request will be made to the service center--the service center is offline. Retrying. --The service center is offline. Retrying. --The service center is offline. Retrying...』
Female-Speaker: "Shiona, this is--!"
Female-Speaker: "I don't know the details, but Tipi-chan's battery seems to be unable to charge."
Female-Speaker: "Unable to charge..."
Is the voltage different? No, that shouldn't be a problem since it's going through the bear plushie.
In that case, is there a problem with the battery itself?
If there's a possibility... could it be deterioration over time? When I think about it, it's a battery that's been running for over 200 years.
It wouldn't be strange if it was completely worn out.
Female-Speaker: "Maybe we need a new battery..."
Female-Speaker: "A brand new battery... Besides, Tipi-chan's generation couldn't be replaced without a specialized technician disassembling it first...!",
Female-Speaker: "No way..."
Cold sweat runs down my back.
In other words, Tipi will stop functioning as is--no, will she die?
Female-Speaker: "No, after coming all this way...!"
Female-Speaker: "It's okay... because I knew this would happen."
We can only stare, as if struck by lightning, at Tipi's voice, which has returned to its usual tone.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi-chan, you knew this was going to happen, didn't you--"
Female-Speaker: "Yes... I thought this would happen since we left the library. I also noticed that the battery charging rate had been dropping for 6427 days."
Tipi answers, smiling weakly.
Female-Speaker: "More importantly, Tipi has to do what Tipi can do... Ray, could you bring me the metal bag that Tipi had?"
Female-Speaker: "O-Okay!"
The slim, yet somewhat rugged metal bag that Tipi had been carrying ever since she left the library. I carry it in front of Tipi, holding the heavier-than-expected bag.
Tipi casually places one hand in the middle of the bag. With just that, the two locks on the handle side automatically unlock.
--Inside was a single black board. Its size was probably about that of a slightly larger book. However, it was much thinner, only about half the size of a short picture book.
Tipi carefully takes it out with both hands and slowly turns to face me.
Female-Speaker: "Ray. Place your palm here. The one that isn't the mechanical hand."
Female-Speaker: "Like this?"
As Tipi tells me, I place my non-prosthetic hand on the jet-black board. Then--
A fluent male voice echoed from the black board.
Female-Speaker: "Current administrator, Vortex Company MSK-3737 model name 'Dorothy' individual name 'Tipi' approves the continuation of work. Continue the registration process."
『Confirmed. Please state the name of the registration applicant to identify the individual.』
Female-Speaker: "Um... Ray."
『Understood. 《Ray》 has been registered as the new administrator. Please receive a verbal explanation of how to use it from the current administrator. That is all.』
Having said that, the black board fell silent.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi, what was that just now...?"
Female-Speaker: "All the books that were in the library, digitized. It's a backup of the data in Tipi's memory."
Tipi answers in a slightly tired--yet somehow accomplished--tone.
I recall the many handwritten books lined up in the library.
Tipi, who had memorized the words written there without missing a single one.
After all, Tipi was the one who wrote those books.
Even if she were to stop functioning someday... no, predicting that she would stop functioning, she left behind a record of prehistoric civilization as books.
Female-Speaker: That place wasn't just a library. Tipi herself was the library.
Female-Speaker: "When you use it, place your hand in the middle of the board just like before. If you do that, the tablet--the board will start to glow. After that, you'll be able to call up all the data with the administrator's voice recognition function..."
Female-Speaker: "Well then--"
As Tipi told me, I activate the board called a tablet. As I was told, I placed my palm on it.
『Biometrics confirmed, administrator Ray authenticated. Which data would you like to load?』
Female-Speaker: "The manual! How to repair Phylloids... um, how to replace the battery!"
『Initiating search... There are 3,195 items and 124,751 types of information regarding Phylloid repair methods. Narrowing down the search is recommended.』
Female-Speaker: "From among those, Vortex Company MSK-3737 model 'Dorothy'."
『Initiating search... Condition matched.』
The surface of the tablet shines brightly. Then, letters floated to the surface.
『Repair by users is almost impossible. Please allow the unit to rest until personnel from the service center arrive.』
The world before my eyes darkened.
Female-Speaker: "How is it? Is it working well?"
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, it's working... but..."
Female-Speaker: "That tablet... only has about fifty years left... of operation..."
That's more than enough time for me, but it probably isn't that long for a Phylloid or a library management system.
Female-Speaker: "Really, is it okay for me to use it?"
Female-Speaker: "Rather, please use it. From now on... Tipi won't be useful anymore..."
Female-Speaker: "That's not true! I've always been helped by Tipi!"
When you fixed Shiona's music box, when you fixed Mad's projector. All of that was possible because Tipi had firmly memorized the library's collection and taught me.
Female-Speaker: "I'm happy to hear you say that, Ray--please use this from now on..."
Tipi, who was sitting on the sofa, slowly lay down.
Female-Speaker: "Tipi!"
Female-Speaker: "Tipi-chan!"
She waited for two hundred years.
I can't let it end here.
Tipi's small mouth opens and closes up and down.
It looks like she's saying something, but her voice is so small that it doesn't reach my ears.
I bring my ear closer to her mouth.
Female-Speaker: "Hey, Ray... Tipi had fun."
Tipi's hand is placed on top of mine.
It's a small, soft hand.
Female-Speaker: "Ray as my father, Shiona as my mother... both of you are kind, and a family I love very much."
No matter how coldly I treated her, no matter how much I pushed her away, I couldn't hide my true feelings.
Tipi had noticed.
How much we cherished Tipi.
From the moment we got involved, it was decided that Tipi would end up like this.
And that there was nothing I could do about it.
Being alone all the time was the only way for Tipi to survive.
But there's no way that's possible.
Tipi has emotions.
We're not perfect enough to overlook sadness.
No, that's not what you call perfect.
Because we can feel sadness, we are allowed to have emotions.
Slowly.
Like a handkerchief falling into the water and sinking, Tipi's eyes are closing.
Even though we created the Phylloid, we can't even save her.
We just create them and then can't do anything about it.
Humans are truly selfish creatures.
Female-Speaker: "Hey, Shiona..."
Tipi's eyelids slowly opened again. But the light has already disappeared from her eyes. She probably can't see anymore.
Female-Speaker: "I'm here... I'm here, Tipi-chan..."
Shiona's voice was trembling slightly.
Female-Speaker: "I'm glad... Hey, Shiona."
Female-Speaker: "Yes...?"
Female-Speaker: "Thank you for everything. You worked hard to keep Tipi from breaking, didn't you?"
Female-Speaker: "I think you realize, Tipi has been running for over two hundred years since she started operating... but her service life was originally one hundred and fifty years. So, this isn't Shiona's or Ray's fault. It was meant to be..."
When Tipi left the library and came to the church, Shiona apologized to Tipi, and Tipi forgave her.
Female-Speaker: That's what that meant....
Female-Speaker: "So, please. Shiona, don't cry... Sing... sing a song..."
Female-Speaker: "Yes... Yes--!"
Female-Speaker: "Tipi... loves Shiona's songs..."
Shiona started to sing a song. Occasionally sobbing, her tune would go off-key. Even so, Shiona continued to sing. To that melody--.
Female-Speaker: "Tha...nk... you..."
Tipi smiled--and then, she stopped moving.
My hands trembled.
It wasn't just my hands.
My whole body was shaking.
Right now, on my lap, a small life has come to an end.
People might say that it's not a life.
But for me, it was an irreplaceable life.
Shiona quietly continues to sing.
Her tune isn't off-key anymore. It's the same as always--but that song had a resonance that was clear beyond compare.
It was a melody dedicated to Tipi.
Something hot flowed down my cheek.
It ran down my chin and fell onto Tipi's cheek.
Even though Tipi isn't crying, she looks as if she is.
I held Tipi close.
That small body will never move again.
That mouth will never speak again.
Those hands will never draw again.
That is 'death'.
Warmth spreads through my head.
Shiona was hugging me.
Suddenly, my eyes feel hot.
This is overflowing emotion. An unbearable pain, an irrepressible sadness... an immense grief.
For the first time in my life, I shed 'tears'.
Tears for Tipi--.
After that, our lives changed drastically.
The e-book terminal containing all the library's books that Tipi entrusted to me.
Thanks to what was once called a tablet, my knowledge was increasing rapidly.
How to grow crops, houses that can be made with just stone and mud, how to predict the weather, and the many animals and plants that can no longer be seen.
Furthermore, a database of newspapers covering the past 350 years until the library ceased functioning.
I'm sure if I searched, I could even find information about myself.
Shiona: "Ray, are you studying again today?"
Ray: "Yeah. There are countless things I need to remember."
Shiona: "What kind of book are you reading today?"
Ray: "Survival--how to survive in any environment."
The power supply to the cold sleep facility wasn't that great. If that's the case, then I have to become able to manage to some extent with only a small amount of power.
I've already started securing drinking water using morning and evening dew, and the problem of securing drinking water, which was the weakest point of this facility, is improving considerably.
Yes, from here on out, I won't be able to move forward by simply relying on physical strength and force like I used to.
From now on, what we need is knowledge. If I have knowledge, I can face many people alone, or even avoid confronting them altogether--or even win.
It might even become possible to help the people of the town.
I greedily absorbed the "power" that Tipi left behind.
While I was reading, Shiona was singing beside Tipi, who had stopped moving.
Among the luggage we brought from town was Shiona's older brother's music box.
Occasionally, instead of singing, she would turn the handle and play the music box's gentle melody.
It was a very peaceful and comforting time.
With my current "knowledge," it would be possible to live with Shiona in this place forever.
That's why... I didn't notice.
That there was something wrong with Shiona's body...
Shiona: "Ray, dinner's ready."
Shiona prepares the meal with a smile, just like always.
She dissolved the oral block in water, making it into a soup.
It closely resembles the orange, fluffy soup that Shiona always made for me in town.
Shiona: "Thank you, I feel energized when I drink this soup."
Shiona: "I'm happy to hear you say that. It makes my heart feel orange."
Shiona: "But, Shiona's soup, the portion is small, isn't it?"
The amount of soup in her bowl is less than half of mine.
Shiona: "I'm a Phylloid, so if I put myself in save mode, this amount is enough."
Shiona: "Is that so?"
Shiona: "Yeah. That's why you need to eat properly, Ray. If you get hungry, you won't have any energy, right?"
Ah... why couldn't I have noticed it?
At this time... her functions as a Phylloid were already declining...
She was only operating at a sufficient level with half the amount of energy I was using.
Like always, I was reading a book, and Shiona was singing a song for me.
While tracing the surface of the tablet with my fingertip, I was pondering if there was a way to free the people of the town.
Then, suddenly, the rhythm of the pleasantly flowing song stopped.
Wondering if something had happened, I looked up, and Shiona was frozen while holding her hand over her mouth.
The music box she was holding had also stopped.
Shiona: "Shiona...? What's wrong?"
Shiona: "Um... no, it's nothing. It's just the song..."
She said that and took a deep breath.
And then she started singing again, but--
Shiona: "...Ah, really? What was the pitch again...?"
Shiona: "Shio...na...?"
Shiona: "Ahaha... that's strange, isn't it? Even though it's a song I loved so much, just wait a moment, I'll remember it soon..."
Shiona closed her eyes and tried to start singing again from the places where she kept stopping.
But the melody flowing from her mouth was completely different from what I knew.
Shiona: "What's wrong... I can't remember my brother's song..."
Shiona: "Shiona!? Is there something wrong with your body!?"
I was an idiot. In the end, I was only thinking about myself.
Shiona was kind to me, cherished me, and I was satisfied with that, spoiled myself... I wasn't thinking about her.
Even though she was caught in an explosion that could have cost her the artificial skin on her arm when we left town.
Shiona: "Shiona! At the time of that explosion, you were actually seriously injured, weren't you!"
Shiona thought for a moment, then shook her head.
Shiona: "I was okay then, yeah."
Shiona--Phylloids don't lie.
But, she will hide words for the sake of humans.
Since she said she was okay, there probably wasn't any damage from being caught in the explosion.
Just as she said--'then'.
Shiona: "...Shiona. Won't you show me what's wrong with you?"
Shiona: "...Okay."
Urged by me, Shiona hesitated only once before nodding.
I tried to avert my eyes in embarrassment at the suddenness of it, but what was there wouldn't let my gaze go.
Shiona's white and firm chest.
There, a small hole was open.
Shiona: "That is..."
Forgetting that it was a woman's body, I approached the wound.
This is a gunshot wound.
I immediately remember the time at Mad's shop when she protected me from the humans.
Shiona: "It... hit me..."
Shiona: "I was wondering if I was okay, but it seems that wasn't the case."
Shiona stuck out her tongue and smiled slightly, like a child caught doing something mischievous, but without showing any sign of being sorry.
I know that's a smile to keep me from feeling guilty.
Even at a time like this, she's thinking of me.
Ray: "...Hrk, search! MODA-117 Alice mk-17 Maintenance Manual!"
Reacting to my voice, the tablet glows faintly.
But Shiona covered the screen with her hand. And then slowly shook her head.
Still keeping her smile.
Shiona: "It's my body. I know it best."
Ray: "But... there might be some way! If you had told me sooner..."
--No, there's a reason she didn't say anything.
Shiona knew that she had a fatal injury that couldn't be fixed.
That no matter how much I struggled, it was a reality that wouldn't change.
It's something too horrible to even put into words.
The word 'death' floated into my head.
No matter how much I don't want to think about it, it just pops into my head.
Shiona: "I know. I'm going to die soon. Since I'm a Phylloid, should I say 'break down'?"
No, Shiona.
You're not going to break down.
I'm going to die.
Shiona: "Ahaha, I guess I've lost a little focus, I can't put any strength into my body..."
Just as I thought her shoulders slumped, Shiona fell straight toward the floor.
Ray: "Shiona!"
I hurriedly caught her, holding her in a position that would be as comfortable as possible.
Since when has she been in this state?
Why couldn't I have noticed...?
Shiona: "Breaking down... does that mean I'll stop being me...? But, I wonder if I can be fixed...?"
Ray: "It's okay... Shiona is Shiona..."
Shiona: "Ahaha... you know, right now... I'm just a little scared..."
Ray: "Shiona... Shiona... ..."
Shiona: "Don't cry, Ray. Tippy-chan will laugh at you if you're like that."
Shiona's hand reached out to my cheek.
What she brushed away with her fingertip was my second tear.
Shiona: "I don't want Ray to turn blue... I always want you to be orange and fluffy..."
Sadness.
An immense sadness wells up.
It multiplies infinitely in my heart, and knows no bounds.
As time passes, that sadness becomes more intense.
Why am I so sad?
That answer comes immediately.
Because you're important to me.
You were an important existence to me.
Even if a Phylloid with the same appearance appeared before me, it wouldn't mean anything.
Even if the appearance is different, it's fine.
As long as the inside is you.
Shiona: "Ray... you know, I thought of you as family. It's partly because you resembled my older brother, but it's not just that. I thought you were important to me."
Family.
That is, an existence that can be believed in and helped unconditionally, without any benefit.
That is 'love'.
The emotion I had wanted before I knew it.
I had noticed that emotion before I knew it.
I had been given it all along... all along.
It's such a natural emotion to have while living and walking with someone.
Shiona: "What's wrong, Ray... don't make such a sad face... That's right, let's sing a song, let's go to the plaza again... everyone will be happy."
Shiona: "...Shiona...?"
Shiona: "Something I promised everyone. You gave everyone smiles, Ray, you made them feel happy."
That is a memory of happier times. Memories of the fun days we spent in town.
It's probably a confusion of memory areas.
But...
Shiona: "...That's right, let's sing. Everyone's looking forward to it."
I turned the handle of the music box that was placed on the floor.
A melody begins to flow quietly.
Shiona relaxed her cheeks, closed her eyes, and began to sing.
I also closed my eyes, listened to the melody, and reminisced.
It wasn't a long time, but I recalled the scenery of that town I spent time in.
People walking down the street stopped and turned to look at us.
One by one, people gathered in the plaza.
Children, the elderly, someone's mother, her husband, the townspeople all began to smile.
As if intoxicated by Shiona's singing melody.
Surely that scene was something that was taken for granted a long time ago.
Humans and Phylloids alike, smiling, spending time together, supporting each other.
It's something we've forgotten... something we've lost...
Shiona: "Hey, Ray... always, always keep smiling, okay?"
Shiona: "...Yeah."
Shiona: "It's okay to be sad, it's okay to be angry... But... after that... smile."
Shiona: "Hey... if love has a shape, it must be round. Because love never hurts anyone."
Holding back my tears, I smiled.
Shiona: "Hey... if love has a temperature, it must be warm. Because love warms you up as if enveloping you."
Shiona: "Yeah... I'm sure it is."
Shiona: "Because there's love, Ray won't be sad. Because love is something that protects, and it won't hurt Ray. I promise. No matter what happens from now on, our love will protect Ray."
I had shed so many tears that my eyes were starting to hurt.
My vision blurred.
But even in that, I could see Shiona's smile clearly.
Shiona: "So don't cry. Love is always by your side. Because love is eternal. You don't have to cry. Because it's eternal."
I placed my hand over Shiona's hand, which was on my cheek.
It was warm, but she had almost no strength left.
It was as if something was spilling out from between the gaps in her fingers.
I knew what was spilling out.
But I didn't want to admit it.
I gripped her hand tightly, wishing that it wouldn't spill out.
I could hear a song.
A warm melody that Shiona always hummed.
It seeped into the gaps in my darkening heart, filling it with warmth.
Shiona: "I'm sorry, for leaving you all alone again."
Shiona: "--! That's not true. That's not true!"
I wanted to tear at my own hair.
Only now did I finally realize.
Shiona wasn't afraid of breaking down. She was afraid that I would be alone again.
Ray: "I... I received so much from Shiona... so much...!"
Shiona: "Ray?"
I grasp Shiona's mechanical hand with my human hand.
That's right, until I met Shiona, I was an ambivalent existence, unable to become either human or Phylloid.
Shiona stayed by my side all that time—and I was able to become human.
Shiona: "Shiona is always inside me, I'm not alone anymore. Joy, sadness, anger... I received it all from you. I'll never forget."
Shiona: "Ah... No, I have to smile here."
I have to reassure Shiona, but my emotions won't allow it...
No matter how hard I try, tears spill out from the rising sadness.
Shiona: "So Shiona, don't make such a sad face. I'll be okay. I'll definitely be okay."
Shiona: "I see... If that's the case, then I'm glad."
Shiona nodded, looking satisfied.
Shiona: "Huh..."
Shiona narrowed her eyes as if confused. Then, as if pushed out by her eyelids, transparent droplets began to cover her eyes.
Shiona: "That's definitely not it..."
I said in a trembling voice, smiling to reassure Shiona.
Now that I've become human, I understand the meaning of those tears.
Shiona seemed to realize it too, and smiled back at me.
Shiona: "Tears... they also flow when you're happy, right?"
The strength slowly drained from Shiona's body.
Am I smiling? Am I?
I wonder if I'm able to keep smiling, so Shiona won't worry.
Shiona: "...See you later."
Shiona: "...Yeah, see you later."
And then, softly.
Shiona closed her eyes.
In that instant, Shiona had probably the most beautiful face I had ever seen.
And after that, Shiona never opened her eyes again.
That peaceful face looks like it's smiling.
As if she's praying for my happiness.
But there's no happiness in a world without Shiona.
The life that will continue for me from now on is nothing but a life in hell.
Can I endure it?
...No, I have to endure it.
My chest is tightened to the point of pain.
All my emotions circulate throughout my body, creaking.
Is my heart this fragile and weak?
Is losing someone precious this painful and agonizing?
Ray: "Uwaah... Aah...!!"
My vision was dyed pure white, and as if to destroy that world, I raised my voice and lamented.
Ray: "Aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...!"
Shiona said.
Certainly, Shiona's love might be eternal.
But I couldn't endure it.
I understand, this is emotion.
Something Shiona gave to me.
This suffering, this sorrow, too.
But that's not all.
The warmth barely remaining in my chest, and the memories with everyone that I can proudly say were fun.
All of that too, Shiona gave to me.
Both of them are mine now.
I will never let go of either.
I wonder how much time has passed.
How much time do humans need to sort out their feelings?
I... I kept remembering the time I met Shiona, over and over again.
The meals we ate together.
The times we woke up in the morning and exchanged greetings.
The times we went shopping together.
The time I went to the abandoned factory and made her worry.
She was so happy when the music box was fixed.
We sang in the town square, surrounded by smiles.
We made a promise....
I learned warmth.
I learned joy.
I even felt anger.
I even shed tears of sadness.
And... I received love.
──No... everything was love.
This tragedy was brought about by the foolishness of us humans, who lost that love.
Humans are hopelessly selfish.
They will repeat the same mistakes...
Even so, they will need someone.
It's instinct. Even when I woke up here, I wanted to see humans.
It's an instinct to seek love, to want to walk alongside someone.
I can't even realize such a simple thing...
I look at the cold sleep devices in front of me.
I had Shiona and Tipi sleeping in each of the few remaining ones that were functioning properly.
They were originally for humans, but this should at least slow down the deterioration.
I wanted to preserve their appearance, even just a little.
Standing before the two of them, who look as if they are only sleeping, I mutter.
Female-Speaker: "Shiona, Tipi... I'm going now."
There's no reply.
Female-Speaker: Of course there isn't.
But, I continued.
Female-Speaker: "I'm going on a journey now. Don't worry, it's not a journey without a purpose. I'm going to find a world where humans and Filoides can coexist."
That was also the wish that young human who was eliminated spoke of.
If there was a world where humans and Filoides could coexist, this kind of sadness wouldn't happen.
If there was a world where humans and Filoides could coexist, there would be no greater joy.
That's why I'm going to look for it now.
Female-Speaker: "And, if that world doesn't exist──"
I clench my iron fist as if covering it with my bare palm.
Female-Speaker: "──No, it definitely exists. The world that you tried to leave for us humans definitely exists."
Finding it will be extremely difficult.
But, I have the knowledge that Tipi gave me.
And, I have the emotions that Shiona gave me.
I have a partner in this world who will continue to convey "love."
So, this journey from now on isn't a journey of despair.
Female-Speaker: "I'll borrow this, okay? I'll come back to return it someday."
In my hand is Shiona's brother's music box.
I turn the handle in front of the sleeping Shiona, letting the melody of peace contained within resonate.
Along with that melody, I felt like I could hear her song.
Female-Speaker: "Well then, I'm off!"
A world where humans and Filoides can join hands──.
I took that first step.
"Even so, I remained hopeful and continued to reach both arms toward the light."
Female-Speaker: "Have you woken up?"
Female-Speaker: "...Where... is this...?"
Female-Speaker: "You've awakened from a long sleep. Do you remember your name?"
My name is...
Female-Speaker: "Manufactured by Asou International, MODA-117 Alice mk-17. An individual name has not been set."
Female-Speaker: "It seems the settings have been initialized. For now, Alice will do."
The man in front of me held out an old-fashioned wooden box.
Female-Speaker: "What's this...?"
Female-Speaker: "It was placed inside the device you were sleeping in."
I receive the box. It felt very nostalgic.
When I opened the lid, there was a dull golden disc. When I turned the handle coming out of the side of the box, a clear tone began to play.
A very beautiful melody flowing as the metal comb is gently plucked.
Female-Speaker: "It's a song that's been played since long ago, isn't it?"
A melody that isn't in my records.
Even so, it's very nostalgic, warm, and makes my chest feel warm.
And at the same time...
Tears are spilling from my eyes.
Female-Speaker: "I've confirmed a runaway emotion function. Maintenance may be required."
Female-Speaker: "No, that won't be necessary. You should cherish those emotions. ...Only the knowledge was left behind, but it took a long time to recover the technology to utilize it. I'm sorry."
The man speaks to me gently.
I feel a nostalgic trace in his expression as well.
It's not in my records──...my memories...
Female-Speaker: "For now, shall we go home after completing the routine maintenance?"
Female-Speaker: "Where to?"
Female-Speaker: "To town."
The outside of the facility was dazzling.
The sky was blue and endlessly high. White clouds were slowly flowing, drawing various shapes.
Warm air filled my artificial lungs. A gentle breeze softly caressed my hair.
It was a natural scene.
For some reason, I feel nostalgic for this ordinary world.
And... for some reason, I feel very sad.
We proceed along the paved road in a car.
Every scene visible from the window is beautiful.
Greenery was lush.
Small fish jump on the surface of a clear stream.
In the sky, small birds are flying intimately while chirping.
Female-Speaker: "Alright, we're here."
Passing through the gate, we arrived at a town surrounded by white walls.
It was overflowing with many people.
Humans and Filoides, hand in hand, living their ordinary lives.
That sight makes my eyes hot again.
Female-Speaker: "Excuse me, there's still a risk of a runaway emotion function. The rhythm pattern in my chest isn't at a normal value either."
Female-Speaker: "It's fine. I'm sure it's the right thing."
Female-Speaker: "Is that so? If that's the case, am I a defective product?"
Female-Speaker: "No, you're normal. You're closer to a human than any other Filoid."
Those words were very pleasing to me as a Filoid.
But I don't understand why you say that.
I gaze intently at the town that I feel nostalgic for.
In a corner of the plaza, a human child and a child-type Filoid are playing happily.
Female-Speaker: That place is a photo studio. The Filoid shopkeeper is smiling as he takes a picture of a human family.
At a general store in a separate location, a human was shopping, and the Filoid shopkeeper was responding curtly.
Female-Speaker: "Sensei, welcome back!"
A very cute little girl Filoid runs up to me.
Female-Speaker: "Hey, I'm back. Have you been a good girl, Dorothy?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes! I drew lots of pictures while Sensei was gone. Look!"
The little girl showed me a picture that she probably drew, with a beaming smile.
The townspeople are in a circle, laughing.
The picture drawn with crayons is very warm, and just looking at it makes my chest feel warm.
It was a picture that made everyone who saw it feel happy.
Female-Speaker: "Huh? You are..."
The girl looks up at me.
Female-Speaker: "Nice to meet you. I'm Alice, nice to meet you."
Female-Speaker: "Ali...ce? Hello, Alice. Dorothy doesn't have an individual registration, so she's Dorothy."
Female-Speaker: "Yeah, me too."
An unregistered Filoid. If I don't have a primary partner, what should I do?
Perhaps sensing my anxiety, the man next to me patted my shoulder.
Female-Speaker: "What would you like to do?"
Female-Speaker: "...What am I capable of...?"
Female-Speaker: "Alice, can you sing a song?"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, a song. Like this."
Dorothy closes her eyes and begins to sing.
It was a little clumsy, but it was a song I recognized.
Female-Speaker: "It's a song that has been sung since long, long ago. There's no one in the world who doesn't know it."
The man said that and took out a music box from the car.
He opens the lid and turns the handle protruding from the side of the box.
A clear sound is plucked, and a gentle melody begins to flow.
As if drawn by the melody, the townspeople gather around.
Everyone listens to the tone, their expressions becoming gentle.
I know this scene.
In the memory area that should be pure white—a memory breathing softly in its deepest part gently taps my chest.
My mouth moved naturally.
That song, which should be the first time I'm singing it, was familiar to my throat, my lips... my heart.
The music box melody filling the plaza is very nostalgic.
Female-Speaker: "Wow, it's so beautiful. You're so good!"
Female-Speaker: "Yes, this song is... a very important song."
