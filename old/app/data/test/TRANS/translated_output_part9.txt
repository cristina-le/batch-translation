That's why I thought I had to endure it, too.
I thought so, but… I couldn't stop myself.
I just couldn't bring myself to leave this girl with such a sad expression in front of me.
I embraced Tipi, and Shiona beyond her, in my arms.
The back of my eyes grew hot.
I knew this was shortening Tipi's lifespan, but I questioned myself why I couldn't stop.
Wasn't I just temporarily satisfying my own desires...?
I really am human after all...
Selfish, full of self-interest, a human who hurts others.
I hugged them both tightly, painfully so.
I drew in the warmth of two people.
As if to fill the void of two hundred years, we brought our warmth closer.
The warmth of three people didn't allow us to feel the cold, even within the freezing facility.
It was that warm.
From Shiona's mouth, a melody naturally spilled out.
That song that Onii-san made.
That melody lights a warmth deep within my heart.
Her gentle singing voice echoed throughout the factory.
"Tipi loves Shiona's singing of this song,"
Tipi said, burying her face in my chest.
"It reminds me of when Papa and Mama were here... and somehow, I can't stop crying."
The girl repeats her sadness.
Tipi has been repeating that sadness for two hundred years.
I may not be able to wipe away those two hundred years of sadness.
But I can give her this moment of warmth.
I decided to put those two hundred years' worth into this fleeting warmth and embrace them both.
But that small moment didn't last long.
"Huh... Tipi?"
I turn my gaze to Tipi, who is sitting on the sofa.
There, Tipi was blankly staring ahead.
"What's wrong? Are you feeling sick or something?"
"Hmm? ...Hmm..."
She doesn't seem very energetic.
Is it because she's been released from the tension, or because she walked for so long?
Either way, it seems like she needs to rest.
"Tipi seems tired too, so should we rest for tonight?"
"...Y-yeah."
She replies a beat late. It seems she was thinking about something.
"Rei, Tipi-chan might be lacking energy. That might be why her attention is scattered."
"I see... then we need to replenish her electricity. --Huh, how do we do that?"
"It's non-contact charging. The charging equipment should be universal, so first we need to find a connector and charge the bear plushie."
"Understood. I'll ask you to confirm if I find something that looks like it."
"Leave it to me!"
Leaving Tipi on the sofa, I begin to check what's inside the facility.
Many cold sleep devices are lined up. I look for one that's still leaking cold air.
Then, I opened the maintenance cover at its base and examined several cables connected to the distribution panel.
Before long, I discovered something that looked like a power connector connected to a thick cable.
"Yeah, this type should be fine. Tipi-chan, lend me your plushie."
Shiona borrows the bear plushie from Tipi, opens the zipper on its back, and exposes the connection terminal.
She inserts the charging connector there, and the bear's eyes blink twice.
That must be the signal that charging has started; Shiona breathes a sigh of relief.
Tipi also grips the bear's hand tightly. Just that seems to transmit electricity; I feel like the light in her eyes has intensified.
"Shiona, let's have a meal too."
I show her the oral blocks I found when I was looking for the charging cable.
It's the same thing we found when we left this facility.
"The taste is nothing compared to Shiona's soup, but I think it's nutritious."
"No, I'm happy because I was hungry. Just being able to eat makes my heart feel warm."
I line up the portable plates and arrange the oral blocks on top.
I thought this would make it look a little more like a meal.
Because it's a time like this, I want to cherish the everyday things, even the small ones.
I wanted to emulate, even just a little, what we used to do in that town... at Shiona's house.
"It looks delicious."
Shiona smiled, as if understanding my wish.
The two of us put our hands together before the meal.
Tipi, who was watching us, comes to our side.
Then, she places the bear plushie in front of us and puts her hands together just like we did.
"Together with everyone."
"Tipi-chan...?"
"Haha, Tipi is a very lavish feast. Very luxurious."
Tipi shyly gave a bashful smile.
In these past few days filled with nothing but hardship, it was a moment of peace.
Surely, in the distant past, we humans lived such a life with our partners called Phylloids.
No, it should be a life we can still reclaim now.
Just like I, who had lost my emotions, was taught by them... we should be able to reclaim the time we had forgotten...
I thought about such things as I brought the oral block remaining on the plate to my mouth.
──It was then.
『Warning. The wear rate of the main battery exceeds 90%. Please replace and maintain the battery immediately.』
Suddenly, Tipi started saying such things in a businesslike tone.
『Online replacement request will be made to the service center――The service center is offline. Retrying.――The service center is offline. Retrying.――The service center is offline. Retrying...』
"Shiona, what is this――!"
"I don't know the details, but it seems Tipi-chan's battery can't be charged anymore."
"Can't be charged..."
Was the voltage different? No, that shouldn't be a problem since it's going through the bear plushie.
In that case, is there a problem with the battery itself?
If there's a possibility... could it be deterioration over time? Come to think of it, it's a battery that's been running for over 200 years.
It wouldn't be strange if it was completely worn out.
"Maybe we need a new battery..."
"A brand new battery... Besides, Tipi-chan's generation couldn't be replaced without a specialized technician disassembling it first... !"
"No way..."
A cold sweat ran down my back.
In other words, Tipi will stop functioning as is... no, will she die?
"No, after coming all this way... !"
"It's okay... because I knew this would happen."
Tipi's voice, back to her usual tone, left us staring as if struck by lightning.
"Tipi-chan, you knew this was going to happen, didn't you--"
"Yes... I thought this would happen since we left the library. I also noticed the battery charging rate dropping 6427 days ago."
Tipi answered with a weak smile.
"More importantly, Tipi has to do what Tipi can do... Rei, could you bring me the metal briefcase Tipi had?"
"O-Okay!"
The slim, yet somewhat rugged metal briefcase that Tipi had been carrying ever since she left the library. Carrying the unexpectedly heavy case, I brought it in front of Tipi.
Tipi casually places one hand in the middle of the briefcase. With just that, the two locks on the handle side automatically unlocked.
Inside was a single black board. Its size was about that of a slightly larger book. However, it was much thinner, only about half the size of a short picture book.
Tipi carefully took it out with both hands, then slowly turned to face me.
"Rei. Place your palm here. The one that's not mechanical."
"Like this?"
As Tipi instructed, I placed my non-prosthetic hand on the jet-black board. Then...
A fluent male voice echoed from the black board.
"Current administrator, Vortex Company MSK-3737 model name 'Dorothy,' individual name 'Tipi,' has approved the continuation of work. Continuing registration process."
"Confirmed. Registration applicant, please state the name to identify the individual."
"Um... Rei."
"Understood. 《Rei》 has been registered as the new administrator. Please receive a verbal explanation of usage from the current administrator. That is all."
Having said that much, the black board fell silent.
"Tipi, what was that just now..."
"All the books that were in the library, digitized. It's a backup of Tipi's memory storage."
Tipi answered in a slightly tired—yet somehow accomplished—tone.
I recall the many handwritten books lined up in the library.
Tipi, who memorized the words written there without missing a single one.
So, Tipi was the one who wrote those books after all.
Even if she were to stop functioning someday... no, predicting that she would stop functioning, she made it so the records of the prehistoric civilization could be left as books.
That place wasn't just a library. Tipi herself was the library.
"When you use it, place your hand in the middle of the board just like before. That will make the tablet—the board—light up. After that, you'll be able to call up all the data with the administrator's voice recognition function..."
"Then—"
As Tipi instructed, I activated the board called a tablet. Just as I was told, I placed my palm on it.
『Biometrics confirmed, administrator Rei authenticated. Which data would you like to load?』
"The manual! How to repair a Philoid... uh, how to replace the battery!"
『Initiating search... There are 3,195 items and 124,751 types of information regarding Philoid repair methods. Narrowing down the search is recommended.』
"From those, Vortex Company MSK-3737 model 'Dorothy.'"
『Initiating search... Conditions matched.』
The surface of the tablet shone brightly. And letters floated to the surface.
『Repair by the user is almost impossible. Please allow it to rest until personnel from the service center arrive.』
My vision went dark.
"How is it? Is it working well?"
"Yeah, it's working... but..."
"That tablet... only has about... fifty years left... of use..."
That's more than enough time for me, but it probably isn't very long for a Philoid or the library's management system.
"Is it really okay for me to use it?"
"Rather, please use it. From now on... Tipi won't be useful anymore..."
"That's not true! Tipi has always been helping me!"
When I fixed Siona's music box, when I fixed Mad's projector. All of that was possible because Tipi firmly remembered the library's collection and taught me.
"It makes me happy to hear you say that, Rei—please use this from now on..."
Tipi, who had been sitting on the sofa, slowly lay down.
"Tipi!"
"Tipi-chan!"
We waited two hundred years.
We can't let it end here.
Tipi's small mouth moved up and down, opening and closing.
It looks like she's saying something, but her voice is so small I can't hear it.
I brought my ear close to her mouth.
"Hey, Rei... Tipi had fun."
Tipi's hand was placed on top of mine.
It's a small, soft hand.
"Rei as my father, Siona as my mother... Both of you are kind, and a family I love very much."
No matter how coldly I treated her, how much I pushed her away, I couldn't hide my true feelings.
Tipi had noticed.
How much we treasured Tipi.
From the moment we got involved, it was decided that Tipi would end up like this.
That there was nothing we could do about it.
That being alone forever was the only way for Tipi to survive.
But that's impossible, isn't it?
Tipi has emotions.
We're not perfect enough to overlook sadness.
No, that's not what you'd call perfect.
Because we can feel sadness, we're allowed to have emotions.
Slowly.
Like a handkerchief sinking into the water's surface, Tipi's eyes are closing.
Even though she's a Philoid we created, we can't even save her.
We just create them and then can't do anything else.
Humans are truly selfish creatures.
"Hey, Siona..."
Tipi's eyelids slowly opened again. But the light has already gone out of her eyes. She probably can't see anymore.
"I'm here... I'm here, Tipi-chan..."
Siona's voice was trembling slightly.
"I'm glad... Hey, Siona."
"Yes...?"
"Thank you for everything. You worked hard to keep Tipi from breaking, didn't you?"
"I think you realize, Tipi has been running for over two hundred years since she started operating... but her lifespan was originally one hundred and fifty years. So, this isn't Siona's or Rei's fault. It was meant to be..."
When Tipi left the library and came to the church, Siona apologized to Tipi, and Tipi forgave her.
That's what that meant...
"So, please. Siona, don't cry... Sing... Sing a song..."
"Yes... Yes--!"
"Tipi... I love Siona's songs..."
Siona began to sing. She hiccuped every now and then, throwing off the tune. Even so, Siona continued to sing. To that melody--
"Tha...nk... yooou..."
Tipi smiled--and then stopped moving.
My hand trembled.
It wasn't just my hand.
My whole body was trembling.
Just now, on my lap, another small life came to an end.
If you were to ask others, they might say it wasn't a life at all.
But to me, it was an irreplaceable life.
Siona quietly continued to sing.
Her tune wasn't off anymore. It was the same as always--or at least, it should have been, but the song had a resonance that was clear as crystal.
It was a melody dedicated to Tipi.
Something hot streamed down my cheek.
It ran down my chin and fell onto Tipi's cheek.
Tipi wasn't crying, but she looked as if she were.
I held Tipi close.
That small body would never move again.
That mouth would never speak again.
Those hands would never draw again.
That was "death."
Warmth spread through my head.
Siona was hugging me.
Suddenly, my eyes grew hot.
These were overflowing emotions. An unbearable pain, an uncontrollable sadness... and an immense grief.
For the first time in my life, I shed "tears."
Tears for Tipi--
After that, our lives changed drastically.
The e-reader containing all the library's books that Tipi entrusted to me.
Thanks to what was once called a tablet, my knowledge increased rapidly.
How to grow crops, houses that can be made with just stone and mud, how to predict the weather, and the many animals and plants that can no longer be seen.
Furthermore, a database of newspapers spanning the past 350 years, up until the library ceased functioning.
I'm sure if I searched, I could even find information about myself.
"Ray, are you studying again today?"
"Yeah. There are countless things I need to remember."
"What kind of book are you reading today?"
"Survival--how to survive in any environment."
The power supply to the cold sleep facility wasn't that great. If that's the case, then I need to learn how to get by with only a small amount of power.
I've already started securing drinking water using morning and evening dew, and the problem of securing drinking water, which was the weakest point of this facility, is improving considerably.
That's right, from here on out, we can no longer simply rely on physical strength to get ahead.
From now on, what we need is knowledge. With knowledge, you can face many people alone, or avoid confrontation altogether--or even win.
It might even become possible to help the people of the town.
I greedily absorbed the "power" that Tipi left behind.
While I was reading, Siona was singing beside Tipi, who had stopped moving.
Among the luggage we brought from town was Siona's older brother's music box.
Occasionally, instead of singing, she would turn the handle and play the music box's gentle melody.
It was a very peaceful and comforting time.
With my current "knowledge," it would be possible to live here with Siona forever.
That's why... I didn't notice.
That there was something wrong with Siona's body...
"Ray, dinner's ready."
Siona, as always, prepared the meal with a smile.
She dissolved the oral block in water, making it into a soup.
It was very similar to the fluffy orange soup that Siona always made for me in town.
"Thank you, this soup makes me feel better."
"I'm happy to hear you say that. It makes my heart orange."
"But, Siona, your soup, is it a little small?"
The amount of soup in the bowl is less than half of mine.
"I'm a Philoid, so if I go into save mode, this amount is enough for me."
"Is that so?"
"Yeah. So Ray, you need to eat properly. If you get hungry, you won't have any energy, right?"
Ah... why couldn't I have noticed?
At this time... her functions as a Philoid were already declining...
She was only operating at a level sufficient for half the amount of energy I was consuming.
As always, I read my books, and Siona sang for me.
While tracing the surface of the tablet with my fingertip, I pondered if there was a way to free the people of the town.
Suddenly, the rhythm of the pleasantly flowing song stopped.
Wondering if something was wrong, I looked up to see Siona frozen, holding her hand over her mouth.
The music box she was holding had also stopped.
"Siona...? What's wrong?"
"Um... no, it's nothing. The song just..."
She said that, and then took a deep breath... *inhale*
And then she started singing again—
"...Ah? What was the pitch again...?"
"Sio...na...?"
"Ahaha... that's strange, even though it's a song I loved so much, just wait a moment, I'll remember it soon..."
Siona closed her eyes and tried to start singing again from the places where she had stopped, over and over.
But the melody that flowed from her mouth was completely different from what I knew.
"What's wrong... I can't remember my brother's song..."
"Siona!? Is there something wrong with your body!?"
I was an idiot. In the end, I was only thinking about myself.
Siona was kind to me, cherished me, and I was satisfied with that, spoiled myself... I wasn't thinking about her.
Even though when we left the town, she was caught in an explosion that lost the artificial skin on her arm.
"Siona! At the time of that explosion, you were actually seriously injured, weren't you!"
Siona thought for a moment, then shook her head.
"That was okay, yeah."
Siona—Philoids don't lie.
But, she will hide words while thinking about humans.
Since she said it was okay, there probably wasn't any damage from being caught in the explosion.
Just as she said—"that."
"...Siona. Can you show me what's wrong with you?"
"...Yeah."
Urged by me, Siona hesitated only once before nodding.
I almost averted my eyes in embarrassment at the suddenness of it, but what was there wouldn't let my gaze go.
Siona's white and firm chest.
There, a small hole was open.
"That is..."
Forgetting that it was a woman's body, I approached the wound.
This is a gunshot wound.
I immediately remember the time at Mad's shop when she protected me from the humans.
"It hit... after all..."
"I was wondering if I was okay, but it seems that wasn't the case," Siona said.
Siona stuck out her tongue slightly and smiled, like a child caught doing something mischievous, but without showing any remorse.
I know that's a smile to keep me from feeling guilty.
Even at a time like this, she's thinking of me.
"...Ghk, Search! MODA-117 Alice mk-17 Maintenance Manual!"
Reacting to my voice, the tablet glows faintly.
But Siona covered the screen with her hand. And slowly shook her head.
Without letting her smile fade.
"It's my body. I know it best."
"But... there might be something we can do! If you had told me sooner..."
No, there's a reason she didn't say anything.
Siona knew it, that she had a fatal injury that couldn't be healed.
That no matter how much I struggle, it's a reality that won't change.
It's something too horrible to even put into words.
The word 'death' floated in my head.
No matter how much I don't want to think about it, it just pops into my head.
"I know. I'm going to die soon. Since I'm a Philoid, should I say 'break down'?"
No, Siona.
You're not breaking down.
I'm going to die.
"Ahaha, I guess I lost a little focus, I can't put any strength in my body..."
Just as I thought her shoulders slumped, Siona fell straight toward the floor.
"Siona!"
I hurriedly caught her, holding her in a position that would be as comfortable as possible.
How long has she been like this?
Why couldn't I have noticed...?
"Breaking down... does that mean I'll stop being me...? But, maybe it can be fixed...?"
"It's okay... Siona is Siona..."
"Ahaha... you know, right now... I'm a little scared..."
"Siona... Siona... ..."
"Don't cry, Rei. Tippy-chan will laugh at you if you do."
Siona's hand reaches for my cheek.
It was my second tear that she brushed away with her fingertip.
"I don't want Rei to turn blue.... I always want you to be orange and fluffy..."
I'm sad.
An immense sadness wells up inside me.
It multiplies infinitely in my heart, never ceasing.
As time passes, that sadness becomes more intense.
Why am I so sad?
The answer comes immediately.
Because you're precious to me.
You were a precious person to me.
Even if a Philoid that looked exactly the same appeared before me, it wouldn't mean anything.
It's okay if you look different.
As long as your heart is still you.
"Rei... you know, I thought of you as family. It's partly because you reminded me of my older brother, but it's not just that. I thought you were important,"
Family.
It's a bond where you believe in and help each other unconditionally, without any personal gain.
That is 'love'.
The emotion I had been craving without realizing it.
I had unknowingly become aware of that feeling.
I had been given it all along... all along.
It's such a natural emotion to have while living and walking alongside someone.
"What's wrong, Rei... don't make such a sad face... That's right, let's sing a song, let's go to the plaza again... everyone will be happy."
"...Siona...?"
"It's something I promised everyone. Rei gave everyone a smile, made everyone feel happy."
Those are memories of happier times. Memories of the fun days we spent in town.
It's probably a corruption of the memory area.
But...
"...Yes, let's sing. Everyone's looking forward to it."
I turned the handle of the music box that was placed on the floor.
A melody begins to flow quietly.
Siona's cheeks softened, and she closed her eyes and began to sing.
I closed my eyes as well, listening to the melody and reminiscing.
It wasn't a long time, but I recalled the scenery of that town I spent time in.
People walking down the street stopped and turned to look at us.
One by one, people gathered in the plaza.
Children, the elderly, someone's mother, her husband, the townspeople all began to smile.
As if intoxicated by Siona's singing melody.
Surely that scene was something that was taken for granted a long time ago.
Humans and Philoids alike, smiling, spending their days close to each other.
It's something we've forgotten... something we've lost that we took for granted...
"Hey, Rei... always, always keep smiling, okay?"
"...Yeah."
"It's okay to be sad, it's okay to be angry... But... after that, smile."
"Hey... if love has a shape, it's surely a round one. Because love never hurts anyone."
Holding back my tears, I smile.
"Hey... if love has a temperature, it's surely warm. Because love warms you as if enveloping you."
"Yeah... I'm sure it is."
"Because there's love, Rei won't be sad. Because love is something that protects, and it won't hurt Rei. I promise. No matter what happens from now on, our love will protect Rei."
I had cried so much that my eyes were starting to hurt.
My vision blurred.
But even through that, I could see Siona's smile clearly.
"So don't cry. Love is always by your side. Because love is eternal. You don't have to cry. Because it's eternal."
I placed my hand over Siona's hand, which was on my cheek.
It was warm, but she had almost no strength left.
It was as if something was spilling out from between her fingers.
I knew what was spilling out.
But I didn't want to admit it.
I gripped her hand tightly, wishing that it wouldn't spill out.
I could hear a song.
A warm melody that Siona always hummed.
It seeped into the cracks of my darkening heart, filling it with warmth.
"I'm sorry, for leaving you all alone again."
"--! That's not true. That's not true!"
I wanted to tear at my own hair.
Only now, I finally realized.
Siona wasn't afraid of breaking. She was afraid of me being alone again.
"I... I received so much, so much from Siona...!"
"Rei?"
I take Siona's mechanical hand with my human hand.
That's right, until I met Siona, I was neither human nor Philoid, an in-between existence.
Siona always stayed by my side...and I was able to become human.
"Siona will always be inside me, I'm not alone anymore. Joy, sadness, anger... I received them all from you. I'll never forget."
Ah... Damn it, I have to smile here.
I have to reassure Siona, but my emotions won't allow it...
No matter how hard I try, the welling sadness makes tears spill out.
"So Siona, don't make such a sad face. I'll be okay. I'll definitely be okay."
"I see... then, I'm glad."
Siona nodded, looking satisfied.
"Huh..."
Siona narrowed her eyes as if confused. Then, as if pushed out by her eyelids, transparent droplets began to cover her eyes.
"I'm sure... that's different..."
I said in a trembling voice, smiling to reassure Siona.
Now that I've become human, I understand the meaning of those tears.
Siona seemed to realize it too, and smiled back at me.
"Tears... they also flow when you're happy, right?"
The strength slowly drained from Siona's body.
Am I smiling? Am I?
Am I able to keep smiling, so Siona doesn't get worried?
"...See you later."
"...Yeah, see you later."
Softly.
Siona closed her eyes.
In that instant, Siona had the most beautiful face I had probably ever seen.
And then, Siona never opened her eyes again.
That peaceful face looks like it's smiling.
As if she's praying for my happiness.
But there's no happiness in a world without Siona.
The life that continues for me now is nothing but a living hell.
Can I endure it?
...No, I have to endure it.
My chest tightens so much it hurts.
All my emotions creak and groan as they circulate throughout my body.
Is my heart this fragile and weak?
Is losing someone important this painful and agonizing?
"Ugh... Aah...!!"
My vision is dyed pure white, and as if to destroy that world, I cried out in lamentation.
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah...!"
Siona said.
Certainly, Siona's love might be eternal.
But, I couldn't endure it.
I understand, this is emotion.
What Siona gave me.
This suffering, this sorrow too.
But, it's not just that.
The warmth that barely remains in my chest, and the memories with everyone that I can proudly say were fun.
All of that too, Siona gave me.
Both of them are mine now.
I won't let go of either, ever.
How much time has passed?
How much time does a human need to sort out their feelings?
I... I kept remembering the time I met Siona, over and over again.
The meals we ate together.
The times we woke up in the morning and exchanged greetings.
We went shopping together.
I went to the abandoned factory and made her worry.
She was so happy when the music box was fixed.
We sang in the town square, surrounded by smiles.
I made a promise... .
I learned warmth.
I learned joy.
There were times I felt anger.
There were times I shed tears of sadness.
And... I received love.
──No... everything was love.
This tragedy was brought about by the foolishness of us humans, who lost that love.
Humans are hopelessly selfish.
We repeat the same mistakes... .
Even so, we will need someone.
It's instinct. Even when I woke up here, I wanted to see a human.
It's the instinct to seek love, to want to walk alongside someone.
I can't even realize such a simple thing... .
I look at the cold sleep devices in front of me.
I had Siona and Tipi sleeping in the few that were left, the ones that were still functioning properly.
They were originally for humans, but this should at least slow down the deterioration.
I wanted to preserve their appearance, even just a little.
Standing before the two who looked as if they were merely sleeping, I mutter.
"Siona, Tipi... I'm going now."
There's no response.
There couldn't be.
But, I continued.
"I'm going on a journey now. Don't worry, it's not aimless. I'm going to find a world where humans and Philoids can coexist."
That was also the wish of that human youth who was eliminated.
If there was a world where humans and Philoids could coexist, this kind of sadness wouldn't happen.
If there was a world where humans and Philoids could coexist, there would be no greater joy.
That's why I'm going to find it now.
"And, if that world doesn't exist──"
I clench my iron fist as if covering it with my bare palm.
"──No, it definitely exists. The world you tried to leave for us humans definitely exists."
Finding it will be extremely difficult.
But, I have the knowledge that Tipi gave me.
And, I have the emotions that Siona gave me.
I have a partner in this world who continues to convey "love."
So, this journey from now on isn't a journey of despair.
"I'll borrow this, okay? I'll come back to return it someday."
In my hand is Siona's older brother's music box.
I turn the handle in front of the sleeping Siona, letting the melody of peace contained within resonate.
In time with that melody, I felt like I could hear her song.
"Well then, I'm off."
A world where humans and Philoids can hold hands--.
I took that first step.
"Even so, I remained hopeful and continued to reach both arms toward the light."
"Are you awake?"
"...Where... is this...?"
"You've awakened from a long sleep. Do you know your name?"
My name is...
"Manufactured by Asou International, MODA-117 Alice mk-17. An individual name has not been set."
"It seems the settings have been initialized. For now, Alice will do."
The man in front of me held out an old-fashioned wooden box.
"What's this...?"
"It was placed inside the device you were sleeping in."
I take the box. It felt very nostalgic.
When I opened the lid, there was a dull golden disc. When I turned the handle coming out of the side of the box, a clear tone began to play.
A very beautiful melody flowing as the metal comb is gently plucked.
"It's a song that's been played since long ago."
A melody that isn't in my records.
