Even the director, who proposed the test startup, had fallen silent.
“It’s a library, you know,”
Shiona said, breaking the awkward silence.
“This town doesn’t have electricity, but the storage facility is still intact.”
“That’s the library?”
“Yeah, that’s right.”
It was as if a ray of hope had shone through.
I felt my cheeks soften.
But Shiona's expression—even though she was smiling, her eyes looked somewhat sad.
The next day, I went to the library with Shiona.
Carrying the handmade projector we made with the townspeople yesterday.
“I didn’t know there was a device like this here.”
Installed at the library counter was a device that could store electricity made using sunlight in portable batteries.
Apparently, it's the only device left in this town.
However, due to the aging of the solar panels, it's not capable of generating a large amount of electricity.
For this town, electrical energy is a precious commodity.
Despite my selfishness, everyone in town permitted me to use such a valuable thing.
They always said, “If you play music for us again.”
However, there was something that I couldn't help but be concerned about.
I had a feeling that the library held some special meaning for the people of this town.
Yesterday's reaction from everyone... Thinking back, even Mad-san's expression changed when I went to the library.
...No, I shouldn't make strange assumptions now.
I averted my gaze from the charging battery and looked at Shiona, trying to hide the anxiety in my heart.
"I'll have to have Shiona sing again."
"Yeah, I'll sing with a feeling of gratitude to everyone."
Shiona gives me her usual smile.
Next to Shiona was Tipi.
She was looking at Shiona with a slightly bewildered expression.
Come to think of it, this is the first time I've seen these two standing side by side.
"Tipi, how long do you think it will take to charge?"
"Umm... probably about thirty minutes more, I think."
"I see, that's surprisingly fast."
"Only thirty more minutes to be with Rei...?"
Tipi makes a wide detour around Shiona and hugs my leg.
Her sad expression hasn't changed.
But I felt that her sadness had eased just a little.
I stroked Tipi's head with the palm of my hand.
As I stroked her silky hair over and over, Tipi rubbed her cheek against my leg.
"...Alright, you two. That's enough."
Shiona wedges herself between me and Tipi.
"Ah... Rei, Rei..."
Tipi reaches out her hand, seeking me.
But her hand doesn't reach me.
"Rei, just a minute..."
Shiona grabs my arm and drags me to the wall.
--Shiona's sweet scent tickled my nose.
"Rei, Tipi-chan is a girl now. Do you understand what that means?"
"I know. She's affectionate and cute, isn't she?"
"That's not what I mean... I don't think it's good to touch her so casually or get too friendly with her."
"Why? I think it's fine if Tipi is happy."
"That's not it... I don't think it's good to touch a girl of her age so casually."
"Even if she's of age, Tipi is still a child, right?"
"Girls mature on the inside faster than they look. She already has a pink heart."
"Pink...? What does that mean?"
"Pink is pink. That's why I don't think it's good."
Shiona seemed more flustered than usual.
She was talking to me with a smile, but her cheeks were slightly puffed out.
Come to think of it, whenever I said I was going to the library, her smile always stiffened.
It seems Shiona doesn't really like me getting along with Tipi.
Even now, it looks like she's competing with Tipi.
"...Hey, Shiona. Could it be that what you're feeling is... 'jealousy'?"
At my words, Shiona's eyes widened and she gasped.
She shifted her gaze restlessly, avoiding looking at me.
It's an expression I've never seen her make before, she who always has a smile on her face.
I reach out my hand to Shiona's head.
"Eh? Rei...?"
And then, I gently stroked her hair, just like I do with Tipi.
"W-Wha, Rei, what's with you all of a sudden? What's wrong?"
Shiona's hair was different from Tipi's, smooth and pleasant to the touch. A nice scent wafted up every time I stroked it.
It was the kind of hair that made you want to touch it forever.
"R-Rei? I feel kind of embarrassed, okay?"
"Ah, sorry. But, I somehow thought this might be a good thing to do."
I don't really understand it, but looking at Shiona now makes my chest feel warm.
A sensation close to the joy I learned about before is welling up.
"S-So, anyway, let's try to refrain from getting too clingy, okay? Promise me?"
"Yeah, if that's what Shiona says, then I will."
That's all I could say.
We return to Tipi's side.
Tipi looked up at us anxiously.
"What's wrong? Is Tipi a bad girl? Is that why you're both angry?"
Tipi furrows her brow sadly.
"It's okay. It's nothing."
"Really? Really, really not angry? Because Shiona's face... is red?"
"T-This is, it's different, okay? I'm not red and prickly!"
"Hmm... Okay, I understand."
Tipi shed tears of relief.
In truth, I want to wipe away those tears with my fingertips, but Shiona would surely dislike that.
So I decided to suppress that impulse.
I turn on the projector, which has finished charging.
A low motor sound whirs, and the exhaust fan starts to spin.
A light at the top, indicating that it is preparing to start, is flashing.
It's been a while since I've seen electric light. Me, Shiona, and Tipi all stared at the flashing light with eyes of wonder.
"Um... where do I insert the chip..."
The control panel on the side of the projector has a broken and exposed lid.
In the center of it, there is a slot for inserting the chip.
I slowly inserted the chip I received from Mad.
The projector flashed a red light busily as it tried to read the data inside.
We watched the process with bated breath.
After about ten seconds, the flashing interval of the lamp shortened--and changed to a green light.
"This... means it's okay, right?"
Anxiety and excitement mixed within me, and my voice was strained.
Yeah, it means the projector is fixed and the data inside is okay.
Shiona's words made my heart soar. I could feel the corners of my mouth naturally turning upward.
I felt a sense of "joy" at the satisfaction of accomplishing something new.
Having finished charging the projector and confirming its operation, we were on our way to Mad's shop.
Tipi said she was getting sleepy and stayed behind at the library.
I wanted her to see it with us, but Shiona scolded me, saying I shouldn't push her too hard.
"I wonder if Mad will be happy."
"Y-Yeah... I'm sure he'll be happy."
"I hope so. It's something everyone in town made together. All the more so because everyone's feelings are in it."
"Y-Yeah... that's right."
"What's wrong, Shiona? Is something the matter?"
Shiona has been acting distant since a while ago.
"N-Nothing. Nothing at all."
"Is that so... I feel like something's different..."
"More than that, Rei, it's cloudier than usual today, and my heart is turning gray."
Shiona muttered as she looked up at the sky.
I looked up at the sky in the same way, but I couldn't tell the difference from usual.
Rather, since it rained, the dust in the atmosphere has been cleared away, and I feel somewhat easier to breathe.
"And it's humid, so I feel all bumpy inside. So, Rei, why don't we relax at home today? Let's get fluffy with orange soup."
I wonder if this air is making Shiona uncomfortable...?
No, I think Shiona's words are probably hiding what she really wants to say.
But I didn't really understand what that meant.
I can't imagine Shiona being mean.
But, we went to the trouble of making it together. I want to show Mad his son's movie soon.
I see... You're right.
Shiona fell silent after that.
She's not angry.
She's keeping pace with me, walking alongside me.
But I could see a shadow in her expression.
We arrived at Mad's shop and stepped inside the dimly lit interior.
Hey... what do you think you're doing, barging in here?
Mad's booming voice echoed from the back of the shop.
He was leaning back in his chair, staring straight at us.
Hello, Mad. Um... this.
I took out the patched-up projector.
Mad glared at it as if he were sizing it up.
What's that? We don't buy garbage here.
That's not it. It looks bad, but this is a projector that can play your son's movie.
My son's movie? I don't remember asking anyone to make something like that.
I know you didn't ask me to. I did it on my own. But, lots of people in town helped me make this. I want Mad to see the movie with everyone.
Like I said, I don't remember asking you to do any of that.
I understand. I did it on my own. So what I'm about to do now, I'm also doing on my own. Stop me if you want to.
I started to walk forward.
But from behind, Shiona tugged on my sleeve, stopping me.
Rei, Mad's being prickly and purple... maybe you should stop for today. How about we try another day?
Shiona, we've come this far. Mad may say that, but he must want to see his son's movie. If we don't watch it here, he'll probably never see it.
Besides, if he really hated it, I'd already be thrown outside.
It's just a guess based on Mad's past behavior, but I don't think I'm wrong.
It's okay, Shiona. So don't look so worried. It's going to be alright.
I nodded firmly, trying to dispel Shiona's anxiety.
…Okay, Rei. If that's what you want to do, then do as you please.
Shiona let go of my sleeve.
I started walking again.
I placed the equipment on the register counter and closed the shop door.
Next, I closed all the window curtains.
The already dark shop became even darker.
It was just the right darkness for playing a movie.
Then, I turned on the projector, which I had just charged. The fan whirred to life, and after a moment, the attached light turned on.
A square of light appeared on the shop wall.
I adjusted the lens I received from the photography studio manager and focused it.
Mad just stared intently at my movements.
Mad, I'm going to play the movie now. Is that alright?
…Do as you damn well please.
Mad didn't deny it.
I'm certain that's the answer Mad wanted to give.
I placed my finger on the button on the control panel…
──Playing.
Mad stared at the square of light with a stern expression.
Within the light, a story begins.
It's the story of a single boy.
It was set in an era when the sky was still blue and nature remained.
Born in a small house in a small town, he never knew his mother.
The father he lived with only provided the bare minimum… it was hardly a relationship you could call family.
And as the boy grew up, the gap between them deepened.
They would fight whenever they saw each other's faces.
Every short conversation was a denial of each other.
Before long, their gazes stopped meeting.
The boy returned home less and less, and eventually stepped onto the path of evil.
His father silently struck him.
His brow furrowed more deeply than usual…
The boy runs out of the house and leaves town.
But that was the beginning of harsh days.
He was conveniently used and betrayed by those he thought were his friends, leaving him battered in body and soul.
The one who supported him through all of that was a woman.
His meeting with her would lead him down the right path.
The boy washed his hands of bad deeds and decided to move to a new town and start his life over.
──He had a family.
A son was born, and he believed without a doubt that he would continue to live happily with his beloved wife.
But… the woman passed away from illness.
There was no time to despair.
He worked desperately to raise the child he had left behind.
However, he was so desperate to work that he didn't realize a gap was forming in his relationship with his child.
Every time they opened their mouths, they would only fight.
Days of drifting apart continued.
And the child, now grown, stepped onto the path of evil as if to spite him…
He thought it was a punishment.
Isn't this exactly what I did to my father?
Now, he curses his immature past.
He thought about how to stop his son, and stared at his hands.
If he opened his hand, he might be able to gently reason with his son, stroking his head and embracing him.
If he clenched his fist, it would become a fist, and he might be able to admonish his son with severity.
As a father, which should he choose?
──He clenched his fist.
The fist that struck his son was hot, his chest ached as if it were being squeezed… deep wrinkles etched into his brow.
But, his son, holding his red and swollen cheek, shed tears.
He had been properly scolded, he was loved… or so he thought.
Hearing those words, he too shed tears.
Why couldn't he have realized what his son had realized back then?
That the face of his father after hitting him wasn't one of anger, but of sorrow.
He took his son and returned to the town where he was born for the first time in 20 years.
The townscape was almost unchanged from when he ran away.
And the small family home, as expected, remained unchanged.
But his father, who lived alone in that house, looked a size smaller than he remembered, perhaps due to old age.
He stood before his father, biting his lip and shedding tears.
His father silently patted him lightly on the shoulder and muttered only one word.
Mad's son's movie was a very old-fashioned type of human drama.
I don't know if it's interesting.
If my emotional functions were normal, I might be able to judge.
But Mad was engrossed in the screen.
He watched the movie in silence from beginning to end.
The end credits finished rolling, and the screen went completely black.
It seems to be over.
Shiona glanced at me once before reaching for the projector's stop button.
The moment her slender fingertip was about to touch the button, I grasped Shiona's hand.
"...? Rei?"
Shiona looked at me with a puzzled expression. But I was staring at the screen.
The screen, which had been completely black, now slowly had words appearing in the center.
The letters, probably handwritten, contained a clear "emotion."
『This film is dedicated to my father』
The words slowly melted into the darkening screen and disappeared.
This time, the movie quietly came to an end.
Silence fell around us.
Even after I turned off the power, Mad was still staring intently at the place where the screen had been.
"Mad... the movie's over, you know?"
A sigh was the response to my words.
"...A boring movie."
He muttered this in a small voice, unlike anything I'd heard from Mad before.
"It was so boring, I got tired of holding back my yawns."
He wiped away the tears that had accumulated from holding back the yawns, as if discarding them, then stood up from the chair and removed the chip from the projector.
Then he clenched it tightly in his palm and sat back down in the chair.
"...Hurry up and get out of here."
He said this in a voice with little inflection, then closed his eyes as if pondering something.
Could it be that the son's feelings didn't reach him through this movie?
Was it just a movie that Mad didn't care about...?
If so, what I did was──
My chest tightened, and I hurriedly called out to Mad, feeling like I had to say something.
But Shiona lightly tugged on my clothes, stopping me.
"Rei, it's okay."
Shiona smiled, lowering the corners of her eyebrows.
"Mad just can't be honest with himself. Let's leave him alone for now, okay?"
Can't be honest...?
In other words, everything Mad said just now was the opposite of what he meant?
"Mad is very clear right now. He's filled with a beautiful light blue. It's thanks to Rei."
"I wonder... if that's the case..."
I feel warmth deep in my chest.
I know this feeling.
It's the emotion called 『joy』.
I'm happy that Mad was pleased with what I did.
I'm overjoyed that I was able to be of help.
We quietly left the shop, so as not to disturb Mad.
Leaving the projector behind so he can watch movies again, whenever he likes.
When we got outside, I could faintly see an orange glow on the other side of the sky.
It was a color that seemed to reflect my own feelings.
"I'm really glad Mad was happy."
"Yes, me too."
But her smile seemed a little sad.
"Eh? What is it?"
"You seem sad somehow."
"Really? I'm not. Mad being happy makes my heart feel all round and full."
"Is that so? If you say so."
"Hey, Rei. Shall we have a feast tonight?"
"A feast? Why?"
"Because it's the anniversary of Rei making Mad happy."
"Anniversary... yeah, it's an anniversary."
"Let's make orange soup and have a fluffy, floaty day today, okay?"
"Yeah, let's do that. I'll help with the cooking."
"Thank you. That makes me very happy, Rei."
Shiona's hand touched mine.
Without a word, we held hands.
The warmth was born within our joined hands.
The orange sky was eventually swallowed by the encroaching darkness of night.
The next day, we decided to sing in the plaza, as we had promised everyone who helped us repair the projector.
Since we had the chance, we wanted Mad to listen with us, so we visited his shop.
But the doors remained closed.
Even though it's usually open by now, a sign reading 'CLOSED' was hanging there.
The shop door was locked, and we couldn't get inside.
I peeked inside the shop through the gap in the door.
The projector was left on the counter.
Nothing had changed since yesterday.
The chair where Mad was sitting was blocked from view by the shelf.
“I wonder what's wrong, Mad. Maybe he's not feeling well?”
“...I knew it would end up like this.”
“End up like this...? What do you mean?”
I tilted my head at Shiona, who spoke as if she knew the shop would be closed.
“From the middle of yesterday's movie, Mad's spiky redness disappeared.”
“Spiky redness...?”
“Yeah, I don't think he needs to endure it anymore. It was the first time I'd seen Mad so calm.”
Shiona smiled, looking troubled.
“Was Mad enduring something all this time?”
“That's right. He really, really wanted to reconcile with his son. He wanted to fly to his son's side. But Mad is always so red and prickly, right? So he never had the chance.”
“So, maybe yesterday's movie was...?”
“That's right. Because Rei showed Mad his son's movie, Mad was able to be honest with himself.”
“...So, maybe Mad went to see his son?”
“Yeah. I think he left town.”
Shiona smiled sweetly. Seeing that smile, I truly realized that I had been able to help Mad.
My chest suddenly felt warm, and it turned into words that came out of my mouth.
“Amazing! That's amazing, Shiona! It's just like that movie! It wasn't the son who went to see his father, but it's almost exactly like the movie!”
“Yes, it is. It's really amazing. But there's just one thing that's troubling me.”
“Troubling?”
Shiona's expression clouded over, and she let out a small sigh.
Even though Mad and his son are reconciling, what could be troubling her?
“I don't think Mad will be back for a while, so we won't be able to get the ingredients for the orange, fluffy soup.”
Shiona said with a serious face.
“That's... troubling, isn't it?”
“Yeah, it's troubling, right? But if we make it while conserving the ingredients we have now, we'll be okay for a while.”
Shiona relaxed her tight lips and smiled.
Looking at her, I felt my cheeks naturally move.
From deep within my chest, something warm welled up.
I don't know what to call this feeling, but I feel very fulfilled.
“I hope Mad comes back soon. I'd really like to hear his story. Maybe his son will come with him, too. That would be even better.”
“Yes, I agree. I hope that happens.”
Little by little, I'm able to learn about emotions. I was really feeling it.
I'm getting closer to the image of who I want to be.
I want to help people more and more.
I want to learn more and more emotions.
That feeling was the biggest driving force behind me.
“Let's get going, Rei. It's getting late.”
“That's right. Let's hurry. I wonder how many people we can make smile today.”
“I'm sure it will be a lot. Even more than yesterday.”
“It's because Shiona's singing voice is beautiful.”
“No, it's because of Rei's playing.”
“Even if you call it playing, I'm just turning the handle.”
“That's what's important. When the person turning it has a kind heart, the music becomes warm and spreads out softly.”
Shiona smiled as she gently spread her hands.
“If it were just my singing, I'm sure no one would stop. My singing is only possible because of Rei's playing. Thank you, Rei.”
My face flushed.
“Why is that, Shiona? My face is really hot.”
“Really? Your face is bright red. You must be embarrassed.”
“Embarrassed? Is this the emotion called embarrassment?”
“Yeah, Rei, you're surprisingly shy, aren't you? Cute.”
Hearing Shiona's words, my face grew even hotter.
After leaving Mad's shop, we visited the plaza.
Even before we arrived, many people had already gathered there.
“We've been waiting for you two! We're counting on you again today!”
“My child has been saying 'Let's go listen to the songs!' since yesterday. Please sing for us.”
“Your songs are so healing. Thank you so much.”
“Big brother, big sister, sing for us again!”
Everyone we met was waiting for our melody.
And everyone had a smile on their face.
This was it.
This is what I had been searching for.
Doing something, being appreciated by people, and being thanked.
This is what I wanted.
What a great feeling.
What warmth deep in my heart.
I wanted to experience this feeling forever.
“Shiona, let's start. Let's make everyone smile.”
“Yeah, of course.”
I turned the music box handle just like yesterday.
The melody overflows.
Shiona weaves a melody to match the sound.
And that melody spreads a large circle of smiles.
Smiles spread throughout the town.
That made me happier than anything.
And Shiona's profile as she sang so happily was my joy.
The townspeople listened with smiles, just like yesterday.
The circle of smiles widens.
Suddenly—I felt a slight discomfort in the hand turning the music box handle.
My right hand, gloved to hide the mechanical hand.
I feel a slight creak in that hand turning the handle.
“Hey, how was that machine from the day before yesterday?”
While I was cleaning up after the performance, I was spoken to and looked up.
There was the director and the townspeople who had provided the parts.
“It was able to play, and Mad was happy. It's all thanks to you all.”
“I see, that's good. It was worth calling out to everyone.”
“It's really thanks to all of you, thank you very much.”
“No, it's nothing... but you know, it's all thanks to your power.”
“Ah, that's right. Because of your actions, people came forward to cooperate like this.”
“But that's because everyone is kind. My actions are just a trigger.”
“Of course, that's part of it. But you won't know or change anything unless you take action. It's not about who's the greatest or who's amazing. The person who acts first has that much value.”
The director and all the people who cooperated wore warm smiles.
“If there's anything else, don't hesitate to ask. We'll cooperate as much as we can.”
The director and the others said that and then dispersed.
Watching them leave, I thought.
“Hey, Shiona.”
“What's wrong, Rei?”
“I really want to make more people happy.”
“Making people happy is a truly wonderful thing.”
“Yes, it is. But being able to feel that way is wonderful, Rei.”
I was a little happy to be praised by Shiona.
I can feel the depths of my heart gradually warming.
“That's why I want to help and be useful to many people. I want to meet more and more people and help them solve their problems and troubles.”
“If that's what you want to do, Rei, I think it's a good idea.”
“Then Shiona, let's go find them! Let's go help the people in this town who are in trouble!”
“...wait.”
“You see, Rei, I think that's a little different.”
I was convinced that Shiona would agree with me.
But she shook her head, looking troubled.
“Certainly, helping people is a wonderful thing. But, I think it's wrong to force it on them.”
“Force it...? I don't intend to do anything like that?”
“Of course, I understand how you feel, Rei. But, people have walls and problems that they have to overcome on their own. If you help them with everything, they won't grow. Of course, helping them is important, but first, that person has to really try their best, and only when they can't overcome it on their own do they need help. So, Rei, let's help someone when they ask for it. It's not too late to help them then.”
I understood what Shiona was saying.
I was able to understand it.
But deep down, I felt like something was bothering me.
Why must I leave my desire to help people as it is?
Why shouldn't I help people on my own?
Why, why, why...?
At that point, I stopped thinking.
Because Shiona's smile seemed somehow sad.
A few days later.
The discomfort resurfaced.
It was the discomfort in my right hand that I had felt when I was playing the music box.
A sensation so small that I couldn't put it into words.
But it was definitely attacking my right hand.
The discomfort was gradually increasing.
After returning to Shiona's house, I tried moving my fingertips one by one in my room.
Then, when each finger reached a certain depth, it would not bend any further.
I can't grab anything with this.
This is a problem that will interfere with my daily life.
No matter how many times I try, the problem doesn't go away.
Maybe it needs a fundamental repair, like taking it apart once.
I have a clue about the cause of this malfunction--I do.
It was when I was looking for that projector.
I really pushed myself too hard in that junkyard.
I felt a strange sensation when I was moving heavy things.
I'll go to that abandoned factory later today.
And I'll go look for tools for the repair.
"Rei, it's time for dinner."
Shiona suddenly enters the room.
I hurriedly put on my gloves and hid my exposed right hand.
"What's wrong? Why are you in such a hurry?"
"It's nothing. I was just spacing out, so you startled me."
"Did I surprise you? I'm sorry about that. I'll knock next time."
"Yeah, thanks. I'd appreciate that."
"Okay, I understand. So, dinner's ready, are you going to eat now?"
I look at the clock.
Before I knew it, the clock's hands had already passed the top.
"It's already this late..."
"It's always so cloudy outside. It makes you lose track of time, doesn't it?"
"Yeah, I'll be there soon. Will you wait for me?"
"Okay, I understand. I'll be waiting in the kitchen, Rei."
Shiona smiled sweetly and left the room.
I took off my gloves again and checked my right hand.
...Somehow, I have to keep Shiona from finding out.
Even if I go to the abandoned factory, it will be after I eat.
I steeled myself and headed to the kitchen.
In the kitchen, Shiona's homemade dishes were lined up.
"Rei, have a seat. Let's eat."
Shiona clasped her hands in front of her face.
I put my hands together in the same way.
"Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil."
These words were taught to me by Shiona.
Before I knew it, I had started offering the same prayer.
That's how much time I've spent with Shiona.
Thinking that, the depths of my heart naturally warmed.
"Huh? It's nothing, really."
"Is that so? You have a happy look on your face? It's all orange and fluffy."
"A happy look? Me...?"
"Yes, very, very much so. Rei, you've been making that face a lot lately. It makes me happy too."
"Does that mean... I'm 'smiling'?"
"Yes, that's right. You didn't smile at all at first, but lately you've been smiling a lot. I'm so happy."
"I'm... smiling...?"
I recall the first day I awoke.
On that day, the face I saw was expressionless.
From that day on, I continued to wish.
I want emotions.
Before I knew it, I seemed to be starting to obtain what I desired.
I felt a lightness in the depths of my heart, glad that this was happening.
With this, I can be with Shiona and the others forever.
I looked down at my right hand.
With this hand, hanging limply and powerless, I can't even use a spoon properly.
Reluctantly, I switched to my left hand and scooped up the soup.
Eating with my unfamiliar left hand proved extremely difficult.
"What's wrong, Rei...? Oh, wait, Rei, are you left-handed?"
"No... I'm right-handed, but my right hand is kind of sore today."
"It hurts? That's terrible! We have to call a doctor... Ah, but there aren't any in this town, so we'll have to call one from a town far away..."
"No, it's okay. It'll heal if I just leave it alone."
This is bad... this is bad.
If a doctor sees me, my true identity will be exposed.
I have to avoid that at all costs.
I want to stay here forever.
"It's probably because you overdid it the other day. Working so hard in the rain..."
"...Yeah, I think that's probably it."
"See, you didn't stop when I told you to. I'm worried about your body, Rei."
"Yeah, thanks. But thanks to that hard work, Mad was happy, so it was worth it."
"Yes, that's true. But don't push yourself too hard."
Shiona looks at me with a worried expression.
I won't do anything that makes her make that face again.
Seeing Shiona with any expression other than a smile makes my heart turn blue.
"Speaking of which, I wonder if Mad-san has returned yet. Have you heard from him since then?"
"Not yet. His son lives a little far away. I'm sure he hasn't arrived yet."
"I see. I hope you hear from him soon."
"Yeah, me too."
After that, Shiona didn't ask me about my right hand.
I finished my meal quickly with my unfamiliar left hand.
Then I returned to my room and began to prepare.
I packed my tools into a bag.
I'll probably end up disassembling my own arm.
I need to solve this on my own.
