I couldn't rely on anyone else.
So I made my preparations carefully.
I heard the sound of knocking at my door as I concentrated on getting ready.
Immediately after, Shiona entered my room.
"Rei, if you don't mind, could we go shop... Are you headed somewhere?"
Shiona asked, her gaze shifting between me and my bag.
"Yeah. I'm just looking for something."
"Where are you going? Is it near? Far? When will you be back?"
"I'm going to the abandoned factory. I'm hoping to come back as early as possible."
"The abandoned factory? What are you going to do there?"
"Um... Actually, the photographer asked me for some parts, so I'm going to go look for them."
It was a lie.
A clumsy lie, but Shiona grinned.
"I see...Be really careful, okay? Even more than normal, because your right hand isn't in the greatest shape, right?"
"Yes, thank you. I'll try to be back as soon as I can."
Shiona saw me off, and I left the church.
My destination: the abandoned factory.
But there was somewhere I had to go before that.
I had to get my story straight for the lie I had told in the heat of the moment.
If by some chance Shiona ran into the photographer and mentioned me, my lie would be exposed.
If that happened, she would be hurt.
I didn't want to hurt her.
So I visited the photographer.
"My, aren't you a sight for sore eyes."
When I opened the door I was greeted by the photographer, who had been polishing a camera.
"Sorry to barge in so suddenly."
"No, it's no problem. I was just thinking of going to your place."
"My place... The church? Did you need something?"
"Ah, just hold on a minute."
He withdrew farther inside the shop.
While I was waiting, I decided to have a look at the photos that decorated the place.
It was decorated with all types of photos, from aged to recent ones.
The era, places, and people in the photos were all different.
But they all had just one thing in common.
Everyone had the same smile on their faces.
I couldn't help being jealous of the people in the photos with their smiling faces.
"Right, sorry for the wait. Here, this is it."
He presented a single photo to me.
The photo showed a smiling Shiona and me, expressionless.
"It's the photo I took before. It took a while to develop. Sorry about the delay."
"That's no problem. Thank you so much. But I don't have any money..."
"It's alright. I was late with it, and it was something I took because I wanted to. It's a freebie."
"Thank you. I'll give it to Shiona."
"Please do. Anyhow, when I look at you like this, you guys really do look alike. You and Shiona's older brother."
"You know her older brother?"
"Ah, but of course. Have you seen the picture of her and her brother together?"
"Yes, I have. The picture where he's holding the music box."
"Yes, that's the one. Actually, I took that picture."
"Is that right? When did her brother leave on his trip?"
"Right after I took that picture, I think. He said he was going to share his music with the world. It was terribly sad for Shiona. She's always smiling nowadays, but at the time she was always crying."
"Shiona? That's hard to believe..."
"But lately she's smiling a lot. Just the same as when her older brother was around. No, maybe even more."
"Really? I definitely think she smiles all the time."
"I think that must be because you're here."
"While I do think it might be because you resemble her brother, I don't think that's the whole reason."
"But I don't do anything for her."
"Doing something for a person isn't the only way to make someone smile. You can make someone smile just by being near them, at their side."
"At their side...Then I'm pretty confident I'm by Shiona's side more than anyone."
"Even I can see that. When Shiona is together with you, she seems to me like she's smiling from the heart."
My own heart grew warm at those words.
I was connected to Shiona's smile.
Shiona was happy because I was there.
"This might be a strange thing for me to ask, but could you stay with her forever?"
"Of course. I'll always, always be at her side, and I'll keep making her smile. That's what I want more than anything."
"Hahahaha, that was almost a proposal. It's a shame she wasn't here to hear it."
"A proposal...?"
Hearing those words, I felt my face grow hot.
I knew what the word meant.
A word for a human couple that vows to spend their lives together.
Was that what my words just then had been?
My face grew even hotter as I thought about it.
I turned my back to the photographer so that he wouldn't see how I'd lost my composure.
"Um, well then, I have to get going, so..."
"Is that right? Take care not to lose the photo, then."
"I will, thank you."
I said my thanks over my shoulder and left the photo studio.
The road to the abandoned factory.
I pushed on across the reddish-brown earth.
Stuffed with tools, my bag was heavy.
I could hear them grinding against each other in the bag hung on my shoulder.
The wind was strong, and it seemed like it might rain any second.
I'd really have it all backwards if I ended up with more malfunctioning parts while I went to repair the one I had.
I decided to hurry to the abandoned factory before it rained.
I was on my way when I spotted something.
I spotted a white, flickering thing in the distance.
But it was so far off that I didn't have any way to be sure of what it was.
Although I couldn't even distinguish how big it was either, the white object seemed to be approaching me slowly.
I strained my eyes, trying to identify it.
In that moment, there was a sudden gust.
I closed my eyes reflexively.
When I opened them again, the white object had vanished from sight.
What in the world was that...?
I stood completely still on the spot for a short while.
But I couldn't stay that way.
The sky was gradually growing ominous.
I had to get to the abandoned factory quickly.
Just as the clouds darkened, looking ready to rain at any moment, I arrived at the abandoned factory.
Inside it was as dusty as ever, and filled with the stench of oxidized oil.
Immediately, finding a handy workbench, I removed the glove on my right hand.
I was already used to seeing the exposed parts.
First, I tried to slowly open and close my fingers.
The malfunction remained, and my movement stopped halfway.
What could have caused this?
I retrieved a light from my bag, shined it on my arm, and tried to peer in.
It didn't seem like there were any foreign objects caught in there.
In that case, it was likely a problem with the internal parts themselves.
I took out my tools and started disassembling my right hand.
The more I disassembled my hand, the more uncomfortable I felt.
I was breaking myself.
If I were to disassemble myself entirely, would I break?
Would that be "death" for me?
What would that have felt like?
If I died, would my consciousness vanish into nothingness?
Would it come back if I was reassembled?
Could that be called living?
I dismantled my arm as I mulled all of that over in the back of my mind, and I reached the cause of the failure.
The piston rod of the cylinder that supplied oil to my fingers was bent and oozing oil.
It was the part I had temporarily detached when I was fixing Shiona's music box.
At the time, I had used the oil in the cylinder to lubricate the music box gears.
It was just a little oil, but it must have been enough to be vital for repeating precise operations with my prosthetic fingers.
Lots of little injuries had added up and turned into a large wound.
But with the rod bent this badly, there was a chance the oil leak would reoccur even if I made a stop-gap repair.
The surest method was replacing this part with a new, identical one.
I stood up and decided to search around me.
Scattered on the floor were newly-made Phiroid parts.
There had to be a part that fit my model scattered somewhere in this Phiroid factory.
With my right arm still disassembled, I investigated inside the factory.
There were many arm, leg, and torso parts scattered around.
The head parts were of such elaborate make that you might confuse them for the real thing for a moment if you weren't paying attention.
I was searching for something that fit me amid all of that.
Looking at my exposed right arm, I checked the model number of the part I needed.
That seemed to be the model number of the necessary part.
I looked for the same model number in the arm parts strewn about.
My model must have used some really rare pieces.
I checked the parts scattered in the factory from top to bottom, but there were none with the same model number.
The dilapidation of this factory was very advanced, even compared to the place where I woke up.
It was clear that it was a facility that had been abandoned long, long ago.
In that case, the manufacturing dates would have been different, and it was understandable that there weren't any parts with the same model number.
I continued to search in a rush, and spotted something marked "AR115."
Its shape looked identical to the part inserted in my arm.
However, the piston and shaft sections were a bit longer.
With this, I could swap the parts with just a bit of modification.
I placed the arm with the "AR115," attached to it onto the workbench, and took it apart.
Once I'd smoothly removed the part, I compared it to the "HR114" part that had originally been installed in me.
It seemed that the "AR115" had an output panel that the "HR114" didn't have.
There were no other alterations.
Immediately, I tried to install the part in my arm.
Unlike when I took it apart, installing it was a bit of a rough journey.
Though I dropped the screws again and again, I finished the installation somehow.
When I tried to move my fingers, I was able to open and close them the same way I had before.
But whenever I did, the dissonant sound of grating mechanisms echoed around me.
Somehow, it seemed to be out of lubrication.
I continued deeper into the factory in search of oil.
I arrived at some darkish oil drums, and the stench of oxidized oil grew sharp.
When I popped them open, every single one was oxidized and unusable.
But in the innermost part of the factory, I spotted a relatively new-looking drum.
When I opened it, there was a small quantity of oil inside that was hardly oxidized at all.
I scooped out some oil with the oil storage tank installed inside my arm.
Then I returned the tank to its original place.
After a short wait, the oil was automatically absorbed, and the mechanical parts slid smoothly.
When I tried moving my hand, I was able to open and close my fingers without any jarring sounds.
I had fixed it.
Looking at my fingers moving smoothly, I felt a sense of relief in my chest.
I put my glove back on, returned my tools to my bag, and left the factory.
The wind outside had grown ferocious.
I was hoping it wouldn't rain, but...
I headed back to the town at a quick pace.
Then, on the way...
There was something white lying on the ground.
It was fluttering as though it was being toyed with by the raging winds.
I stared for a moment, then realized that it was a cloak.
During one of its many flutters, I saw something wrapped inside of it.
It was in the shape of a human.
I hurriedly approached it, kneeling down and gently pulling back the cloak with disbelief.
Inside was a young man with grave wounds.
Blood was flowing from his wounded arm, and I knew at once that he was human.
"A-Are you okay!?"
"Ur... gh..."
He let out a groan, seemingly responding to my voice.
His body bore painful-looking wounds, and he didn't seem like he could stand at all.
At the young man's feet were marks that looked as if he had been crawling.
Blood clung to the marks, indicating the severity of his condition.
I had to help him.
Something like a sense of duty oozed outward through my body, starting from inside my chest.
"Please stay with me! Are you okay!?"
Throwing the bag on my shoulder to the ground, I sat him up.
When I shook his body he made an anguish expression and moaned louder still, possibly jolted by the pain.
Then he reached out his hand as if to clutch at something.
I immediately presented him with my open right hand.
He grabbed my mechanical hand through my glove.
Damn it. I regretted that bitterly inside my mind.
But his grip was so very weak that I couldn't bring myself to shake him off.
The young man slowly opened his eyes and looked at me.
"Y... You..."
"A-Are you okay? There's a town nearby. I'll take you there right away."
"A... town..."
His eyes empty, he muttered my words as if to think them over.
Then, his weak fingers traced over my glove as if he was making sure of my hand in his.
Surely I'd given myself away.
He must have noticed the inhuman, hard sensation through my glove.
But I didn't mind.
This wasn't a situation where I could worry about that.
"Y-You... live in... th-that town."
"Li... ves... in town..."
He repeated the word "town" like an incantation.
The word was frail, seemingly ready to vanish at any moment.
I decided I would take the young man home with me.
If I acted now, I might be able to save this person.
I put his arm around me and carried him, dragging him along.
His gait was heavy, and it took us quite a while just to advance ten meters.
But I wanted to help this man... I wanted so badly to save him.
"You... how long have you... been... in town?"
The man asked, looking ready to faint at any moment.
"About a week now."
"I... see... I... see..."
I could feel him weakening against my shoulder.
If I didn't keep him conscious, he might never wake up again.
"Stay with me, we're almost there. We're almost at the town. It's not very big, but everyone is kind."
Desperate, I spoke to the young man.
If I could just talk about something that drew his interest even a little, it should keep him from losing consciousness.
"There's no doctor, but we have books, so I'm sure we can figure out how to treat your wounds."
"Boo... ks?"
"Yes! About everything. We can definitely look up anything we need. So please stay with me."
"Any... thing... huh?"
"Yes! Definitely!"
He sucked in a long breath, and whispered quietly.
"Leave me..."
I wasn't sure what he'd said.
I stopped in my tracks without thinking.
"Leave me... behind. Like this..."
"I-I can't possibly do that!"
"I was... attacked by humans..."
"By humans?"
"I just... just went to go... follow my dreams... but, my dream... my values..."
He sucked in another long breath.
"Because of differences in values... humans... have conflict, grow hostile, and fight... We become inhuman... savages..."
"Th-That can't be. Humans are warm; they share everything and support each other."
"Ah, that was my dream..."
The young man went limp, as if it to release all of the breaths he'd sucked in until now.
"Hey, s-stay with me, please! Please keep it together!"
Had he just lost consciousness, or...
Horrible thoughts spun inside my head.
I gritted my teeth, looked straight ahead, and walked on toward the town.
Every second mattered in order to save this person's life.
Before I knew it, rain was pounding hard against our backs.
Rainwater was getting inside my glove, but I wasn't in a place to be worrying about it.
In a daze, I carried the young man to the church.
"Rei, what's... wh-who is that!?"
Shiona offered me a flustered greeting.
"This man was on the ground on the way! He's really injured!"
"Got it. Bring him inside."
Guided by Shiona, I carried the young man to a room with a bed.
When I laid him on the white sheets, the rainwater and blood on his body mixed together, spreading to form a red stain.
There was no sign that he would regain consciousness.
"Rei, I brought water."
I put the cup that Shiona handed me to the young man's mouth.
I poured in just a bit of water.
His throat pulsed as he swallowed.
But still, he remained unconscious.
He was turning even paler than he was when I had first found him.
"Shiona, I'm going to the library! There must be a medical book there!"
Looking like she was about to speak, Shiona bit her lip.
I was curious, but every second mattered in this situation.
Giving her a sidelong glance, I dashed out of the room.
Unconcerned at the idea of getting wet, I ran off to the library.
"What is it, Rei? You're all wet."
Perhaps surprised by my sudden entrance, Tipi stared at me with widened eyes.
Undeterred by my ragged breathing, I asked her.
"Tipi... are there medical books here?"
"Y-Yeah, there are."
"Please, could you show me right away?"
"Got it."
She must have guessed something was up.
Tipi immediately showed me to where they were.
"Is someone sick?"
Tipi asked without turning around, on the way to the books.
"Yeah... They're hurt."
"Is it you? Shiona? Or..."
"No, it's someone you don't know. So you don't need to look so sad."
"But... but, but..."
Large tears ran along her cheeks.
She didn't know the young man.
And yet...
Tipi was such a kind child to shed tears for him.
"It's all right... It's fine."
I held Tipi, gently wrapping her up in both arms.
I could feel her hot tears through my clothing.
I knew my chest was aching slightly inside.
Putting up with that ache, I scrounged for medical books.
But no matter how many books we had, we were nothing more than amateurs.
We had no idea what his symptoms were, what treatment we ought to give, or even which books were right.
I just took as many books as I could carry and brought them home from the library.
I returned to the church, unconcerned that the books would get wet.
When I opened the door, there was music coming from inside.
It was a melody sung by Shiona.
By her singing voice alone, it was clear that this was a holy place.
"Shiona, how does he look?"
"Not good. He hasn't woken up. I did what I could, but..."
I ran to the young man.
The bandages wrapped around him must have been Shiona's work.
But his face was even paler than it had been before.
I threw the medical books open roughly.
I flipped through the pages, looking to see if there was anything that could be done.
But it had all been in vain.
No matter how wonderful a medical text we found, in the end it was no more than a bundle of paper.
Given our lack of medical knowledge, there was never any hope that we could have used medicine to save someone.
We were all too helpless, all too insignificant.
Shiona began to sing quietly.
It was different from the usual; a quiet tune like a requiem.
"Ngh... This song..."
The young man's eyes opened with Shiona's singing.
But their gaze was empty, ready to vanish any moment.
"Do you know this song?"
"Yes, it takes me back... I sang it, often..."
His eyes traced over the ceiling, then toward Shiona and me.
Then, suddenly, his expression softened.
"Ah, it was here... The world I was searching for was here..."
"What are you talking about? What do you mean, the world you were searching for?"
He didn't answer my question; perhaps his ears could no longer hear.
He simply continued to speak in a one-sided conversation.
"The path to coexistence... The world of harmony..."
When he finished speaking, he closed his eyes.
Then he didn't budge an inch.
I felt like something was spilling over inside of my chest.
"Hey, Shiona, why aren't his eyes opening? Is he sleeping?"
"His hands were clenched before, and now they're relaxing..."
"Shiona, what's the problem... Is he... tired?"
An indescribable sense of loss weighed heavily inside my chest like a storm cloud.
Pain shot through me like the storm inside my chest was ripping me apart.
Shiona hugged me from behind.
Her warmth allowed me to regain my composure a little.
Reflexively, I put my arms on top of Shiona's where they wrapped around my chest.
"Shiona... I, I..."
"Rei... We'll give him a funeral."
"A funeral?"
"It's a kind of ceremony we do when people die."
"When people die..."
With those words, I became aware.
Aware that this man had died.
"It's the only way we can mourn the dead."
I couldn't move as I listened to Shiona's words.
I couldn't properly process the existence of death as it appeared before my eyes.
"So then, we need to prepare. Will you help me?"
I couldn't do anything but give a slight nod.
We started to prepare the funeral.
To mourn this young man whose name we didn't know.
As we were preparing for the ceremony, I couldn't help but focus on one thing.
I had left Tipi at the library despite how much she was crying.
I wondered if she was still crying.
In that dark library. All alone.
"Rei? What's wrong?"
Shiona noticed I had stopped working on decorating the altar.
"Yeah... I'm a bit worried about something."
"Worried? About what? That man?"
"No, not him... I'm worried about Tipi."
"Tipi? What happened to Tipi?"
"When I went to borrow those medical books, I told Tipi all about the young man. Then Tipi began to cry... And what I did next was terrible. I left her like that at the library."
"So she turned blue, and is still blue now."
"Yeah, that's right. So I was wondering if she was still crying..."
"...Yeah, she probably is. I think she's definitely still crying at the library."
I could easily imagine it.
And just thinking about it tore me apart.
"Shiona, would it be alright if I go check on Tipi?"
Shiona gave a slightly sad smile.
"There's still a bit more preparation for the funeral. So I hope you'll come back really quickly."
"Okay, I will. I'll come back as soon as I can."
"...Good. Please hurry back."
Shiona gave me a strangely sad smile, as expected.
I finished the altar decorations I was working on and headed to the library.
I carried the medical books I had borrowed.
A light rain had begun to fall on the town, so I opened my umbrella for the walk.
The town felt different than usual.
It was as if something important was lacking. Or had gone missing...
I ran through the lacking town, hurrying to the library.
Inside the library, I found myself wrapped in a silence which had seemingly turned off the sound of the rain.
No, there was one sound.
From inside the library I could hear the sound of the blue girl crying.
My feet carried me along the way to the sound of the tears.
She was in the same place she always was.
Just as usual, she was drawing while tears were streaming down her face.
"Rei... Rei..."
Once she saw me, Tipi reached out with her small hand.
I hugged her little body in response.
As soon as I did, her crying began to intensify.
"Rei... What happened to that guy?"
Her words left me speechless.
"Hey, Rei...? Rei..."
"That guy... Hey... Hey..."
My silence was the answer.
Seemingly figuring out the situation and unable to hold in her sadness, Tipi began to sob uncontrollably.
She wept enormous tears for the young man she had never met.
Ah, what is this?
I wondered what the pain within my chest was.
The inside of my chest felt churned and constricted.
At times, it struck me with a sharp pain.
It felt as if the pain was pouring out of an open wound within me.
Gathering heat, it began to pour out of my eyes.
Suddenly, I realized I was crying.
The death of a young man whose name I didn't even know had me in tears.
Suddenly, I understood.
This was "sadness."
A blue emotion.
The feeling that was always smoldering inside of Tipi.
It must have always been this painful and intense.
There was no end to the tears.
I didn't know how to stop them.
No, that wasn't right.
I didn't want to stop them.
I realized that I just wanted to let these warm tears continue to flow from me.
I knew that they must be the cure for sadness.
By letting the sadness that had grown in our chests flow out, we were protecting our hearts.
Realizing that, I noticed that the heaviness deep inside my chest had begun to lessen.
At the same time, I noticed the amount of tears had increased.
I cried.
We cried.
Covered in tears, we held each other and cried.
We cried, and cried, and cried...
No matter how much time passed, the tears did not end.
They simply continued, with our sadness showing no sign of crumbling away.
"Tipi, the funeral is going to start soon."
"...Funeral? What is that...?"
"It's a ceremony to say farewell to those who have died. Shiona is preparing for it right now."
"Farewell...? What's farewell?"
"We won't be able to see them anymore."
"Won't be able to... No!"
Tipi clung to me tightly.
Her arms were trembling slightly.
"I understand, Tipi. I understand what you're feeling. But because we're sad, we have to say farewell properly."
"Since we won't see them anymore, we say farewell and see them off. If we don't do that, we'll just feel sad and lonely..."
"Sad... Lonely..."
"Exactly. That's why we send them off. To no longer feel lonely and sad... Do you think you can do it?"
Tipi slowly moved away from me.
She looked up at me with tears still flowing.
"...You can. I know you can, Tipi."
"You do? I'm not so sure."
When I placed my hand on her head, she seemed to cheer up a little.
But there was still no end to her tears.
"Well then, let's go... Can you stand?"
"Yes... Just a second."
As she stood, Tipi picked up her stuffed bear.
The bear was always with her. Even now it was snuggled under her arm.
Holding hands, we walked in the rain towards the church.
"Oh, sweet and merciful God, our Father above, we believe in Your only Son who You sent to us, and now we entrust in Your hands this young man who has completed the journey of life and wishes for life eternal."
"We ask that You please take all the burden of this brother of ours who is now gone from us, guide him to his new home in Heaven and grant him a place amongst the angels."
"And we ask that You guide those of us under the suffering of this separation through the hope of resurrection You have promised, and that one day we too shall experience everlasting joy with You and Your child whom You have called back to Your side."
Shiona's voice echoed through the church, which was overflowing with attendees.
No one had seen the young man.
No one had known him.
But despite all of this, every single person there had gathered to mourn his death.
This was what it meant to care for people. It was what connected person to person.
Everyone had their hands clasped together in front of them, eyes closed and silent in prayer.
Tipi and I followed their lead.
Shiona's voice reverberated throughout the church solemnly.
It was as if she was dedicating it to the young man. It sounded like a song...
After the funeral, the young man was buried in the graveyard behind the church.
Every one of the townsfolk walked up to the coffin to say their final farewells.
Wishing him a good afterlife...
We shall meet again one day...
Eternal rest...
They each said their own words.
"Okay, Tipi."
We neared the coffin for our turn.
Tipi stared at the coffin that contained the young man.
There was no sign of the tears that had flowed constantly until the funeral began. She only stared expressionlessly at the young man.
It was as if she had lost her emotions.
She was silent.
She stared and stared at the coffin.
Feeling an intense anxiety as I looked at her, I began to say something.
But just before I did, she opened her mouth.
Her voice was a soft murmur.
A few hours passed.
The rain had stopped, and light peeked through a rift in the clouds for a change.
The sun sneaking through the ashen sky was indeed an uncommon event.
But I wasn't captivated by the beauty of the scenery.
I was focused on the expression that had been on Tipi's face during the funeral.
It was an empty expression; too empty to be called sadness.
I had no idea what it meant.
Despite that, there was only one thought on my mind.
I wanted to be there for her.
I wanted to be near her and speak with her.
I wanted to mend the sadness within her.
The thought swelled up inside of me.
Shiona called out to me just as I went to open the door.
"I thought I'd go and see Tipi."
"I'm worried because of how sad she looked during the funeral."
"I see... But I'm worried about you, Rei."
"Yeah. You look so incredibly sad, Rei."
"I look... sad?"
My hands went to touch my own cheeks.
"You won't be able to tell that way. Come over here."
I was pulled by my hand into the living room and stood in front of the mirror.
"Look. Your face. It's expressing sadness."
The face I saw reflected in the mirror was my own... And it was blue.
Shiona always referred to Tipi as "blue," and I understood what she had meant, then.
Right then I was making the same exact expression as Tipi.
My heart was quiet, but my body was drained of energy. My expression looked as if gravity was dragging it down.
"...This is the first time I've seen my face like this."
It was... sadness.
Even without tears, being consumed by this feeling made my expression look "blue."
"A person died. That look on your face is completely appropriate."
