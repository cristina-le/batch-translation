Even the photographer, who'd suggested testing the projector, went quiet.
"The library."
Shiona spoke up, breaking the awkward silence.
"This town doesn't have electricity, but there is still a storage battery."
"And that's at the library?"
"That's right."
It was as though I'd seen a ray of hope.
I felt my expression soften.
But Shiona... Although she was smiling, her eyes looked somehow sad.
The next day, Shiona and I went to the library together.
We brought the hand-made movie projector we put together with the townspeople yesterday.
"I had no idea that there was equipment like this here."
The library counter was furnished with a device that allowed electricity produced using sunlight to be stored in a portable battery.
Apparently, it was the only device of its kind remaining in this town.
However, the solar panels were aged and unable to produce a lot of electricity.
For this town, electricity was precious.
The people of the town allowed me to use something precious to them in my own selfish errand.
Just so long as I played music for them again, they said.
But there was something I couldn't shake.
I had a feeling that this place, the library, had special meaning for the townspeople.
Everyone's reaction yesterday. Thinking back, even Madd's expression changed when I decided to go to the library.
But it seemed too soon to be making strange conjectures.
As I tore my gaze from the battery beginning to charge, I looked toward Shiona while trying to hide the uneasiness in my heart.
"I'm going to have to get you to sing again."
"Right, I'll put all my feelings of gratitude toward everyone into my singing."
Shiona turned to me with her usual smile.
Beside her was Tipi.
Tipi was looking to her with a slightly perplexed expression.
Coming to think of it, this was the first time I had seen these two together.
"Tipi, how long until it's charged?"
"Hmm... In about thirty minutes, maybe."
"That's surprisingly quick."
"Does this mean I can only be with you for another thirty minutes...?"
Tipi made a wide detour around Shiona and clutched my leg.
Her sad expression was unchanged.
But even so, I felt that sadness had calmed just a little bit.
I petted Tipi's head with my palm.
As I stroked Tipi's silky hair over and over, she pressed her cheek to my leg.
"You two. That's enough."
Shiona forced her way between Tipi and me.
"Ah... Rei, Rei..."
Tipi reached out in search of me.
But her hands didn't reach me.
"Rei, can I speak to you for a moment?"
Shiona grabbed my arm and pulled me over to a wall.
Her sweet scent tickled my nose.
"Rei, Tipi is a girl. Do you know what I mean?"
"I get it. She's attached to me. It's cute."
"That's not it... I don't think you should touch her so freely, or get too close to her."
"Why's that? I think it's fine if she's happy."
"I mean... I don't think it's good to casually touch girls over a certain age."
"Over a certain age, sure, but isn't Tipi still a child?"
"Girls age on the inside faster than their appearance does. She's already got a pink heart."
"Pink...? What does that mean?"
"Pink is pink. So I don't think it's a good idea."
Shiona seemed to be losing her composure, an unusual sight.
She was speaking to me with a smile, but her cheeks were a little puffed out.
Thinking on it, when I decided I was going to the library, her smile always went a little stiff.
It looked like she didn't like me trying to be friendly with Tipi very much.
Even now, it looked almost like she was competing with Tipi.
"Hey, Shiona. Is this, just maybe, the feeling they call 'jealousy'?"
At my words, her eyes went wide and she gulped.
Her gaze moved around restlessly, and she tried not to look my way.
It was the first time I'd seen this look on Shiona, who never let her smile fade.
I reached my hand out to her head.
"Huh? Rei...?"
Then I petted her hair gently, as I had with Tipi.
"Ah... What are you doing all of a sudden, Rei? What's the matter?"
Her hair was smooth and pleasant to the touch, unlike Tipi's. Each time I petted it, I could smell its fragrance.
It was the type of hair that made you want to pet it forever.
"R-Rei? I'm getting a little embarrassed here. Please?"
"Ah, sorry. I just felt like I should do that, sort of."
I didn't really understand, but looking at Shiona right then made my chest grow warm.
A sensation close to the joy I knew before was welling up within me.
"A-Anyway, you shouldn't let her be too clingy. Okay? Can you promise me?"
"If you say so, I will."
Because that was all I could do.
We headed back to Tipi.
She was looking up at us uneasily.
"What happened? Did I do something wrong? And now you guys are mad?"
Tipi's eyebrows scrunched up together sadly.
"It's all right. It's nothing."
"Really? You guys really, really aren't mad? But Shiona's face... It's all red?"
"N-No, it's not! My face isn't red or hot or anything!"
"Um... Okay, I see."
Tipi shed tears, seemingly relieved.
In truth, I wanted to wipe away those tears with my fingers, but I knew Shiona would hate that.
So I decided to hold back that urge.
I powered on the projector, which had finished charging.
The low whine of the motor sounded out, and the cooling fans started to turn.
The light at the top indicating that it was starting up was flickering.
It was an electric light, something I hadn't seen in a while. Shiona, Tipi, and I watched it flicker with amazed eyes.
"Um... And the chip goes..."
There was an exposed control panel on the side of the projector, its cover broken.
In the center, there was a spot to insert a chip.
I slowly inserted the chip that Madd gave me to look after.
The reading indicator light flashed red hurriedly as the projector checked the data inside the chip.
We watched with bated breath.
After about 10 seconds, the gaps between the flickers grew shorter, and the light turned green.
"Does this mean everything is okay?"
Mixed with anxiety and excitement, my voice went shrill.
"Yes. The projector is fixed, and the data inside is okay too."
A weight lifted off my chest at Shiona's words. I knew the corners of my lips were rising spontaneously.
I felt "joy" in the satisfaction that comes from accomplishing something new.
Having charged the projector and checked that it was working, we headed to Madd's shop.
Tipi stayed at the library, saying she was sleepy.
I wanted us to see it together after all our hard work, but Shiona chided me, saying that it wasn't good to push her.
"I wonder if Madd will be happy."
"Y-Yeah... I'm sure he will be."
"That would be nice, since it's something all of the townspeople made together. Everyone put their feelings into it, so it's even greater."
"R-Right... Yeah."
"What's up, Shiona? Did something happen?"
Shiona had grown distant somehow.
"No. It's nothing."
"I see... I just felt something was off..."
"More importantly, Rei, today is cloudier than usual. It makes the heart gray, too,"
she whispered, looking up at the sky.
I looked up at the sky too, but I didn't see any difference from the usual.
In fact, the dust in the air had settled after the rain, and I felt like it was a bit easier to breathe.
"And it's so soggy, it's making me feel hollow. So Rei, why don't we rest at home today? We can get powapowa with some orange soup."
Was something in the air or situation making Shiona uncomfortable?
I felt that what she was saying had to be hiding what she really wanted to say.
But I was unsure of what that meant.
I couldn't imagine Shiona as the type to do something unsavory.
"But everyone really worked hard to make this. I want to show Madd his son's video right away."
"Right... You're right."
With that, she went silent.
She couldn't have been mad.
She matched my steps, and followed alongside me.
I caught a bit of gloom in her expression.
When we reached Madd's shop, we walked inside the dim store interior.
"Hey... what are you doing, just letting yourselves in?"
From inside the shop came Madd's rumbling voice.
He was in his chair, staring straight at us.
"Hello there, Madd. Um... here."
I pulled out the cobbled-together projector.
Madd scowled at it as if he were giving it an appraisal.
"What's that? We don't buy trash here."
"It's not trash. It's nothing special to look at, but it's a projector that can play your son's video."
"My son's video? I don't remember asking you to make me anything like that."
"You didn't. I did it myself. But all sorts of people in town helped to make it. Everyone wants you to see the video."
"I said, I don't remember asking for that."
"I know. I did it of my own accord. And what I do next is also of my own accord. If you're going to stop me, do it now."
I tried to walk forward,
but Shiona pulled at my sleeve from behind to stop me.
"Rei, he's all purple with rage... We should stop for today. Why not try another day?"
"Shiona, we came all this way. He might say all that, but he must want to see his son's video. If he doesn't now, he never will."
"And if he really didn't want to, he would have already thrown me out."
It was just a guess from all of his actions until now, but I felt certain.
"It's all right, Shiona. Don't look so worried. Everything's okay."
I gave a strong nod, trying to eliminate her uneasiness.
"I understand, Rei. If you want to do it, then do as you wish."
Shiona let go of my sleeve.
I stepped forward again.
I placed the device on the counter, shutting the door of the shop.
Next, I completely closed all of the curtains on the windows.
The shop interior, dark at the best of times, grew dimmer still.
The perfect lighting for playing a movie.
Then, I powered on the recently-charged projector, the fans humming as they turned, and before long the light turned on.
A square light floated on the wall of the shop.
I adjusted the lens I got from the Photographer, setting the focus.
Madd simply watched intently as I worked.
"Madd, I'm going to play the movie. Is that okay?"
"...do whatever the hell you want."
He didn't refuse me.
I was convinced that was the answer he wanted to give.
I drew my finger near the button on the control panel...
And pressed play.
Madd watched the square light with a grave expression.
The story began in the light.
It was the story of a young boy.
It was a time when the sky was still blue and nature flourished.
Born in a small house in a small town, he never knew his mother.
He lived with his father, who provided a bare minimum of care. One could hardly call the relationship a family.
As the boy grew, so did the divide between him and his father.
They fought every time they were together.
They both refused to have even a short conversation.
Eventually, they even stopped making eye contact.
The boy started coming home less and less, and began heading down a bad path in life.
Seeing this, his father hit him without saying a word.
With his brow furrowed deeper than ever before...
The boy dashed out of his home and left the town.
However, that was only the beginning of a difficult time for him.
He found himself used and betrayed by those he thought friends. His body and soul became battered.
There was one woman who supported him.
Meeting her helped guide him back to a proper path.
Washing his hands of evil deeds, the boy moved to a new town to start his life over again.
He finally had a family.
They had a son, and he believed without a shadow of a doubt that he and his beloved wife would live happily ever after.
However, illness came and stole her life away.
There was no time to despair.
He had to work feverishly to raise their child.
However, due to the intensity of his focus on work, he failed to notice the gap that was growing between his son and himself.
Whenever their mouths opened, arguments followed.
Their days of simply passing each other by continued.
Then, as though in condemnation, his own son began heading down the wrong path...
He thought it was a punishment.
Was this what he had done to his own father?
He cursed his younger self.
He stared at his hands, wondering what he could do to stop his son.
If he opened up his arms and proceeded with warmth and care, perhaps he could redirect his son.
If clenched, his hands could show his son the severity of the situation.
As a father, he had to choose.
He clenched his fists.
The hand he had used to strike his son was hot, his chest tightened painfully... and his brow furrowed deeply.
However, as his son held his swollen, red cheek, he began to cry.
He said that having been scolded by his father, he realized he was actually cared for...
Hearing that, he began to cry himself.
Why hadn't he realized so long ago what his own son had just now?
After striking him, his father's face had not been filled with anger, but rather with sorrow.
He took his son with him to the town of his birth, which he had not seen for over twenty years.
It had barely changed from the time he had run away.
Nor had the house where he was born.
However, his aged father had become much smaller than the man he had remembered, as though diminished by age.
Standing in front of his father, he bit his lip as tears began to flow.
Silently, his father struck his shoulder gently, then spoke a single phrase.
Madd's son's movie was a fairly old type of human drama.
I had no idea if this was interesting or not.
Perhaps I would have known if my emotional functions had been working properly.
But Madd's gaze was fixed on the picture.
Silent from start to end, he watched the movie.
The credits rolled as it finished, and the screen went black.
It was done.
Giving a look my way, Shiona reached for the stop button on the projector with her finger.
The moment her dainty fingertip was about to touch the button, I grabbed her hand.
"Um? Rei?"
She looked at me curiously. But I was staring at the screen.
The pitch black screen. A few words slowly rose to the center.
Those words, probably handwritten, were full of distinct "emotion."
"This movie is dedicated to my father."
Gradually the text merged into the darkened screen and disappeared.
Then the movie had silently announced its ending.
Silence filled the place.
Even when I turned off the power, Madd continued staring fixedly at where the screen had been.
"Madd... The movie is over."
A sigh came in response to my words.
"What a boring movie,"
he murmured in a small voice I didn't think possible for him.
"So boring I'm tuckered out from trying not to yawn."
He wiped away the wetness that had welled up in his eyes from the yawns he was holding back, stood from his chair, and retrieved the chip from the projector.
He held it tightly in his palm and returned to his seat.
"Go home already,"
he said in a dull tone, eyes closing as if he was thinking something over.
Had his son's feelings not come through during the film?
Was the movie nothing to Madd?
If so, what I had done was for naught.
My chest tightened and I called out to Madd hurriedly, thinking I needed to say something.
But Shiona pulled lightly at my clothing, interrupting me.
"Rei, it's fine."
The ends of her eyebrows lowered, Shiona smiled.
"Madd just isn't being earnest. Let's leave him be for now. Okay?"
Not being earnest...?
So what Madd had said meant the complete opposite?
"Madd is so very light and fluid now. He's filled with a beautiful light blue. All thanks to you."
"Is that right? In that case, then..."
I felt a warmth inside my chest.
I knew this feeling.
It was the feeling of "joy."
I was happy that Madd was happy.
Unbelievably happy that I'd been helpful.
We quietly left the stop so as not to disturb Madd.
We left the projector behind, so he could still see the movie whenever he wanted.
When we left the shop, we saw a faint orange light across the sky.
It was a color that seemed to reflect our feelings.
"It's so great that Madd was happy."
"It is."
But it was a somewhat sad smile.
"Hm? What do you mean?"
"You look a bit sad."
"Do I? It's not like that. It warms my heart that Madd was happy."
"Yeah? Then everything is fine, I guess."
"Hey, Rei. Why don't we have a feast today?"
"A feast? Why?"
"Because today will be the anniversary of the day you made Madd happy."
"The anniversary... Yeah, it will be, won't it?"
"I'll make orange soup and we can get powapowa for the day."
"Yeah, all right. I'll help with the cooking."
"Thank you. I'm so happy, Rei."
Her hand touched my hand.
Our hands intertwined naturally, neither of us taking the lead.
A warmth came from inside the hand she held.
The orange sky was finally being swallowed up by the dark of night that had crept up.
The next day, we decided we'd sing in the plaza as we'd promised everyone who helped us fix the projector.
After all our effort we wanted Madd to hear it as well, so we visited his shop.
But the door was closed.
Even though it was a time when he would normally be open already, there was a sign that read "Closed" hanging out front.
The shop door was locked, and we couldn't go inside.
We peeked through the crack of the door and looked inside the shop.
The projector was still on the counter.
Nothing had changed since yesterday.
The chair Madd had been sitting on was hidden by a shelf, out of sight.
"I wonder what happened with Madd. Maybe he's not feeling well."
"I knew this would happen."
"You knew? What do you mean?"
I tilted my head at Shiona, who almost seemed to have been aware that the shop would be closed.
"Halfway through the movie yesterday, Madd was bright red and irritated, but it went away."
"Red and irritated?"
"Yes, I think he lost the need to hold back. It was the first time I'd ever seen him so quiet."
Shiona smiled worriedly.
"Madd was always holding something back?"
"That's right. Really, he had always wanted to reconcile with his son. He wanted to rush off to his son. But Madd is always bright red and harsh, right? So he didn't have any excuse to go."
"So, then maybe the movie yesterday...?"
"Right. Since you showed him his son's movie, he was able to be honest with himself."
"Does that mean he went to see his son?"
"Yeah. I think he left the town."
She smiled sweetly. With her smile, I really felt like I'd been helpful to Madd.
My chest immediately went hot, and I blurted out my feelings.
"Wow! Shiona, that's great! It's just like the movie! It's pretty much the same, except the father went to go see the son instead!"
"Yeah, it is. It's really amazing. But I just have one concern."
"A concern?"
She let out a little sigh as her expression clouded.
What could be bothering her even with Madd reconciling with his son?
"I don't think he'll be back for a while, so we won't be able to get the ingredients for our powapowa orange soup,"
she said with a serious face.
"That... is a problem."
"Right? But if we ration what we have now, we'll be all right for a little while."
Her stiff expression crumbled, and broke into a grin.
Seeing her like that, I felt my cheeks move spontaneously.
From the depths of my chest, something warm welled up in me.
I wasn't sure what I should call the sensation, but it was a very satisfying feeling.
"I hope he comes back soon. I definitely want to hear about it. Maybe he might even come back with his son. That'd be even better."
"It would. I hope that happens."
Little by little I was learning about emotions. I could really feel it.
I was getting closer to the image of my ideal.
I wanted to help people more and more.
I wanted to learn many more emotions.
Those feelings were the motivation that drove me, more than anything.
"Let's get going, Rei. It's getting late."
"You're right. Let's hurry. I wonder how many people we can make smile today?"
"A lot, I'm sure. Many more than yesterday."
"Because your singing voice is so beautiful."
"It's because we have your performance."
"You call it a performance, but I'm just turning a handle."
"That's important. If the person turning the handle is kind, the song will spread through the air all fluffy and light."
Smiling, Shiona spread out both of her hands gently.
"If it was just my singing, I'm sure no one would stop. Your performance complements my singing. Thank you, Rei."
My face burned hot.
"Shiona, what's happening? My face is really hot."
"You're right. Your face is bright red. You must be feeling shy."
"Shy? This is the emotion of shyness?"
"Right, you're an unexpectedly shy guy, Rei. It's cute."
My face grew hotter and hotter at Shiona's words.
Leaving behind Madd's shop, we arrived at the plaza.
Many people had already gathered there before we'd even arrived.
"We were waiting for you two. Best of luck!"
"My kid has been asking to go hear your song since yesterday. We'd love to listen."
"Your songs are comforting. Thank you."
"Mister, miss, play a song!"
Everyone who we met was waiting for our melodies.
And they were all smiling.
This was it.
What I'd been looking for.
Doing something to make people happy, to earn their gratitude.
I'd been looking for this.
It felt so great.
It made my chest so warm inside.
I'd always wanted to get a taste of this feeling.
"Shiona, let's start. Let's make everyone smile."
"Yeah, of course."
I turned the handle of the music box just like I had yesterday.
The melody came pouring out.
Shiona spun a melody in time with the song.
And that melody spread out into a circle of big smiles.
Smiles that spread throughout the town.
I was happy for that more than anything.
And seeing Shiona beside me as she happily sang brought me joy.
The townspeople were lost in the music with grinning faces, just as they were yesterday.
The circle of smiles expanded.
Suddenly, I felt a slight discomfort in the hand I used to turn the music box handle.
My right hand, in the glove that I used to hide my mechanical parts.
I felt a slight, strange catch in that hand as it turned the handle.
"Hey, that machine yesterday, how'd that go?"
While gathering our things after the performance, I looked up after being spoken to.
There stood the photographer and the townspeople who had supplied us with parts.
"We were able to play the movie, and Madd was happy. Thanks to all of you."
"I see, that's good. It was worth asking everyone."
"It's really all thanks to all of you. Thank you."
"Oh no, it was no problem... But it was all due to your strength that things turned out this way."
"Yes. Because you took to action, all of these people came to help."
"But that's because everyone is kind. All I did was start things."
"That's true too, of course. But you don't know until you try, and nothing will change if you don't. It's not about who was most important or who to praise. There's a special value in being the first to make a move."
Starting with the photographer, everyone who helped me out smiled a warm smile.
"Don't hesitate to tell us if you need anything. We'll do what we can to help."
After he spoke, everyone scattered and left the area.
I was thinking as I looked at their backs as they left.
"Hey, Shiona."
"Yes, Rei?"
"I really do want to make even more people happy."
"Making people happy is really wonderful."
"It is. It's lovely that you can see things that way, Rei."
I felt a little happy being praised by Shiona.
I could tell the inside of my chest was gradually getting warm.
"So I want to help all kinds of people and make myself useful to them. I want to meet more and more people, and help resolve their troubles and concerns."
"If you want to do that, I think you should."
"Then, Shiona, let's go find them! Let's go help the people with troubles in this town!"
"Hold on."
"Um, Rei, I think that's a bit off the mark."
I was convinced that Shiona would support my idea.
But she shook her head from side to side with concern in her eyes.
"Helping people is definitely wonderful. But I don't think you should push that on anyone."
"Push it on them? But I didn't have any intention of doing that."
"Of course. I understand how you feel. But there are some obstacles and problems that people have to overcome on their own. If you help them out with everything, they won't grow. It's important to help people, but first they need to really give it their all, and only if they still can't manage with their own effort do they need help. Do you see, Rei? Help people when they come to you for help. It won't be too late to help them then."
I understood what Shiona was saying.
I was able to comprehend it.
But inside of my chest, it felt like something was tugging at me.
Why couldn't my desire to help people have just stayed how it was?
Why couldn't I help people on my own?
Why, why, why...?
Then I stopped thinking about it,
because Shiona's smile seemed a little sad to me.
Several days later.
The discomfort came back again.
The discomfort I felt in my right hand when I was turning the music box.
A sensation so slight I couldn't put it into words.
But it was definitely there, in my right hand.
Gradually the discomfort grew greater.
After I went back to Shiona's house, I tried moving my fingers one at a time in my room.
No matter which finger I moved, I couldn't bend it past a certain point.
I wasn't able to grab things in this state.
It was a problem severe enough that it could hinder my daily life.
I tried again and again, but I couldn't fix the defect.
It might have even needed comprehensive repairs that would require a disassembly.
I had an idea as to the cause of this malfunction.
It was from when we were looking for that projector.
I had really overdone it at that dump site.
When I was moving heavy junk, I had felt a discomfort.
I decided that I would go to the abandoned factory later that day.
I needed to go looking for tools for repairs.
"Rei, it's mealtime."
Shiona suddenly entered my room.
I hurriedly put on my glove, hiding my exposed right hand.
"What's the matter? Why the rush?"
"It's nothing. I was spacing out, so I was just startled."
"Did I surprise you? Sorry about that. I'll knock next time."
"Yeah, thank you. If you could, that would help."
"Yeah, I get it. Anyway, the food is ready, so will you eat soon?"
I looked at the clock.
I realized that the hands were already past 12 o' clock.
"It's already this late..."
"It's just that it's really cloudy outside. It makes you lose your sense of time."
"Yeah, I'll go eat right away. Will you wait for me?"
"Sure. I'll be waiting in the kitchen, Rei."
Shiona grinned and left.
Once again, I removed my glove and checked my right hand.
I had to make sure that Shiona didn't find out somehow.
I would have to go to the abandoned factory after we ate.
I readied myself and headed for the kitchen.
The kitchen was filled with Shiona's handmade cooking.
"Have a seat, Rei. Let's eat up."
Shiona clasped her hands together in front of her face.
I clasped my hands in the same way.
"Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil."
The words I had learned from Shiona.
I had started offering the same prayer without even realizing.
It was because of how much time I had been spending with Shiona.
When I thought about that, the inside of my chest warmed spontaneously.
"Hm? Nothing, really."
"Really? You're making a happy face. You're all orange and powapowa."
"A happy face? Me...?"
"Yes, very, very happy. You make that expression a lot lately, Rei. It makes me sort of happy, too."
"Could that be what they call 'smiling'?"
"Right. At first you never smiled at all, but lately you smile so much. I'm glad."
"I'm smiling...?"
I recalled the first day of my awakening.
That day, my face was expressionless when I saw it.
From that day on, I had constantly wished.
I had wished for emotions.
And it seemed that without having noticed, I was starting to get what I had wanted.
Pleased, I felt a weight leave my chest.
This would have let me stay with Shiona and everyone else forever.
I looked down at my right hand.
I wasn't able to use a spoon properly with this hand of mine hanging loose and weak.
With no other options, I switched to my left hand and scooped up some soup.
Eating with my left hand was unfamiliar and arduous.
"What's up, Rei? Oh, are you left-handed?"
"No... I'm right-handed, but my right hand kind of hurts today."
"It hurts? Oh my! We need to call a doctor... Ah, but there's none in this town, we'll have to call one from a town far away..."
"No, I'm fine. It'll get better if I leave it alone."
This was not good... not good at all.
If a doctor looked me over, my true form would be given away.
I just had to avoid that.
I wanted to stay here forever.
"It must be because you overdid it the other day. You worked so hard in the rain..."
"Yeah, I think that's probably why."
"This is because you don't stop when I tell you to. I'm worried about you."
"Yes, thank you. But Madd was happy thanks to all that effort, so it was for the best."
"Yeah, you're right. But you can't overexert yourself."
Shiona looked at me with a concerned expression.
I decided to take care not to force her to make such an expression again.
When I saw her with anything but a smile, I felt blue inside.
"That reminds me; I wonder if Madd is back. Have you heard from him since?"
"Not yet. His son lives in a place kind of far away. I'm sure he still hasn't arrived."
"I see. I hope we hear from him soon."
"Yeah, me too."
After that, Shiona didn't ask any more about my right hand.
I finished my meal quickly using my awkward left hand.
Then I returned to my room and began getting dressed.
I stuffed my tools into my bag.
I probably had to dismantle my own arm.
I needed to solve this alone.
