Something hot fell from my eyes.
"Emotion malfunction detected. Maintenance may be necessary."
"No, no need for that. You should treasure those feelings. We were left with knowledge and nothing else, and it took a long time to recover the techniques required to put it to use. I'm sorry."
The man spoke kindly.
His face looked familiar somehow, as well.
Not in my memory... My memory...
"Anyway... Let's finish your maintenance and head back."
"Back where?"
"To town."
It was bright outside the facility.
The sky was blue, and stretched upwards forever. White clouds of various shapes floated slowly by.
Warm air filled my artificial respiratory system. A gentle breeze rustled through my hair.
This was all perfectly natural.
But for some reason this totally normal world made me feel strangely nostalgic.
And for some reason, deeply saddened.
We rode in a car down a paved road.
The view from the window was beautiful the entire way.
I saw greenery.
Small fish jumped from the surface of a lovely stream.
Little birds chirped and flew through the sky in tight formation.
"Okay, here we are."
We had come through the gate into a town encircled by white walls.
It was overflowing with people.
Humans and Phiroids walked hand in hand, going about their daily lives.
My eyes grew hot as I watched.
"I'm sorry. My emotional functions really do seem to be malfunctioning. My heart rhythm is also abnormal."
"That's okay. I'm sure that's how it should be."
"Really? Does that mean I'm defective?"
"No, you're working fine. You're more human-like than any other Phiroid."
As a Phiroid, I was very happy to hear that.
But I didn't know why he would say so.
I looked closely at the strangely familiar town.
In the corner of the plaza, a human child and a child model Phiroid were playing together.
There was a photography studio there. The Phiroid shopkeeper was smiling and taking a photo of a human family.
A ways away, a grumpy Phiroid was running a general store while humans shopped.
"Welcome back, Doctor!"
A very cute little girl Phiroid came running up to us.
"Hi, I'm back. Have you been a good girl, Dorothy?"
"Yeah! I drew lots of pictures while you were gone, Doctor. Look."
The little girl showed off her drawing, and her face split into a grin.
It showed the townspeople gathered in a circle and smiling.
The crayon drawing was so warm that just looking at it made my heart feel toasty.
It was a drawing that could make people feel happy just by looking at it.
"Huh? You're..."
The girl looked up at me.
"Nice to meet you. I'm Alice."
"Alice...? Hello, Alice. I'm called Dorothy 'cause I don't have an individual unit name."
"Yes, I'm the same."
Unregistered Phiroids. What should we do, without a primary partner?
The man beside me seemed to understand my worry, and he patted me on the shoulder.
"What would you like to do?"
"...What can I do?"
"Alice, can you sing?"
"Yeah, sing. Like this."
Dorothy closed her eyes, and started singing.
She wasn't the best singer, but the song was familiar.
"This song has been sung since long, long ago. There's no one in the world who doesn't know it."
As the man spoke, he took the music box out of the car.
He opened the lid, and turned the handle on the side of the box.
Rich tones spilled out, and a gentle melody began to play.
The townspeople gathered, as if pulled in by the melody.
They all listened to the tune, and their expressions grew peaceful.
I knew this scene.
My memory should have been wiped clean, but something more deeply remembered than that tugged at my heart softly.
My mouth opened naturally.
I knew it was my first time singing this song, but it was familiar to my throat, my lips... and my heart.
The music box's tune felt incredibly familiar as it filled the plaza.
"Wow, that's beautiful! You're so good!"
"Yes, this song... It's very precious."
